"What Accounts for Racial Disparties in Colon Cancer                                 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Background:  Racial and socioeconomic          inequalities are thought to be major contributors to differences in health and       disease outcome in the US. National data confirm lower rates of screening,           more advanced disease and higher morbidity and mortality among the poor and          ethnic/racial minorities.  There is a need to understand the role of social          factors, specifically race and SES, as determinants of cancer-related                morbidity and mortality, and to identify their mechanism of action.                  Objectives:  The primary objective of this study is to assess the unique                           effect of race and SES as determinants of differences in incidence, treatment        and disease outcome between black and white with colorectal cancer (CRC).            Another objective is to assess and compare the independent contribution of           other factors such as age, gender, screening compliance, coexistent illnesses        on CRC morbidity and survival among a subset of these CRC patients.  Methods:           This study will have two phases:  1) A retrospective phase will include a)           assessment of incidence and mortality rates for CRC in the state of Alabama          using data from the Alabama Statewide Tumor Registry (ASCR) for a period of 4        to 5 years; b) development of neighborhood measures of SES, based on 1990            census data and, c) matching of cancer cases with SES, based on area of              residence. II) A formative phase during which individual interviews as well as       medical records abstraction will be conducted on a randomly selected subset of       CRC patients. This phase will gather individual-level socioeconomic and              demographic data and information about co-morbidity at the time of diagnosis.        Analyses will assess the association of contextual SES and ethnicity as well         as that of individual SES and other factors on colorectal disparities.                                                                                                    The proposed research is part of a 5-year plan of didactic work, fieldwork           experiences and research training. This plan will provide the candidate needed       training opportunities: a) to develop/enhance her skills and expertise in            developing, conducting and evaluating sound and relevant clinical and                community-based research in cancer control, particularly among special               populations groups and; b) to complete her transition toward an independent          and productive career in public health research and academia.

"Reducing Colorectal Cancer in African Americans  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Low-income, underserved African-               Americans have disproportionate colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality.           This is partly due to late-stage diagnosis and low receipt of timely                 screening.  Having a usual source of care is a major predictor of screening;         however, little is known about specific features of those usual sources of           care as they relate to colorectal cancer screening. This proposal assesses           specific characteristics of primary care systems associated with receipt of          timely screening.  Informed by national data and focus groups, a culturally          appropriate community clinic-based intervention will be conducted to promote         colorectal cancer screening.  In striving to help decrease the gap in                screening for African-Americans, this project is consistent with NCI's               Strategic Plan to Reduce Health Disparities.                                                                                                                              The research aims of this proposal are to:  Phase I, 1) Characterize the             population least likely to receive colorectal cancer screening using                 nationally representative data (Medical Expenditure Panel Survey linked with         the National Health Interview Survey--MEPS/NHIS).  2) Examine MEPS/NHIS to           identify barriers and facilitators of colorectal screening in low income and         minority groups in community clinics.  This includes assessment of features of       primary care associated with screening.  In, Phase II, the candidate will use        these findings to develop and pilot test the feasibility and preliminary             effectiveness of a simple low-cost community-clinic based intervention.  This        intervention will be a randomized controlled trial of a personalized targeted        letter to promote colorectal cancer screening, it will be conducted in 360           non-adherent women and men, age 55 and over, from a clinic serving low-income,       predominantly African-American persons in Washington, D.C. The findings from         phase I (on barriers and facilitators of screening and primary care use) will        inform the content of the targeted letter, and the surveys used to assess this       intervention. (Yrs 2-5)                                                                                                                                                   This award will provide the time and resources for structured and applied            educational experiences to ensure the short-term goal of successfully                completing this project, and ultimately of becoming an independent                   investigator.  Major endpoints will be:  1.) Published papers on features of         primary care associated with adherent colorectal screening for low-income            adults; and, on the feasibility of the clinic intervention.  2.) Submission of       an R01; and, 3.) Disseminating findings to those who impact services for low-        income persons.  A physician-researcher trained in preventive medicine and           public health, the candidate has potential to fulfill the goals of the Cancer        Prevention, Control and Population Sciences K07 Award and to become a fully          independent investigator.

"Coverage, Organization of Care, and Colorectal Screening  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Institute of Medicine recently issued a report calling for improvements in the quality of cancer prevention services. Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Colorectal cancer screening could substantially reduce the morbidity and mortality of this disease, yet screening rates are surprisingly low. Insurance coverage and the management practices of health plans may be critical factors if we are to increase screening rates. We propose to analyze data from two national survey samples and to develop a new survey of health plan medical directors to examine insurance coverage and managed care as determinants of colorectal cancer screening. The specific aims of the study are: (1) Using national data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), we will assess rates of colorectal cancer screening before and after the Medicare program instituted first-dollar insurance coverage for colorectal cancer screening in 1998; (2) Using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), we will assess whether colorectal cancer screening rates are higher among Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care health plans compared to those with fee-for-service insurance controlling for other confounding factors. Additionally, we will examine whether disparities in colorectal cancer screening rates for socioeconomic minorities are smaller for managed care enrollees than for others; (3) Using structured interviews of health plan medical directors, we will evaluate and compare the quality management programs of health plans that have high colorectal cancer screening rates and those with lower rates. Results of this study can guide the enactment of health policies that will increase rates of colorectal cancer screening and thereby reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer and its associated morbidity and mortality.

"Colon Cancer Prevention in Low Income Housing Sites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly preventable cancer, yet it is a leading cause of cancer death in the US. Disparities in CRC morbidity and mortality by socio-economic position and race/ethnicity have been documented. While individual health behaviors do not fully explain differentials in mortality by socioeconomic position, they are significant determinants of societal patterns of risk. These patterns reflect the social context, or larger structural forces that shape the texture of people's day-to-day realities, and that include an array of social and material resources that ultimately have profound effects on health. Little research has been conducted to date to examine how best to intervene within a social context, or to determine what settings are best for addressing contextual factors. Low-income housing sites have great potential as a channel for addressing disparities, as many social contextual factors occur in the housing setting. The goal of this project is to evaluate an intervention designed to address colorectal cancer prevention (CRC) through low income housing sites. A key aspect of the intervention is to determine ways in which addressing the social context in low income, ethnically diverse populations may address disparities in CRC prevention.   This study is a randomized controlled trial that will be conducted in 10 diverse low income housing sites; eligible residents will be enrolled in a cohort and followed; housing site will be the unit of randomization and intervention. The intervention conditions are: (1) a social contextual, housing site-based intervention, that addresses individual, organizational, and systems-level factors that influence participation in CRC prevention activities; or (2) minimal treatment control. The primary outcomes are physical activity and participation in colorectal cancer screening. Of note, both interventions will offer equivalent access to CRC screening. A key goal of this project is to determine if adding on-site outreach and contextually focused activities yield greater overall changes in the study outcomes and is more cost-effective, compared to self-help materials plus efforts to reduce barriers to screening access.

"MEHARRY CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The objective of the Clinical Research Center (CRC) at MMC is to support clinical research to improve the health of African Americans and other populations with health disparities, and to increase the nation's pool of minority physicians and dentists carrying out clinical research. The specific aims are:   1) to strengthen the administrative infrastructure of the CRC and to diversify the clinical research activities in the CRC by developing initiatives in oral health, community health, clinical pharmacology, and a collaborative clinical research network; 2) to increase the type and quality of direct research support available to both junior and experienced clinical research faculty; and 3) to increase the number of medical and dental faculty conducting clinical research using the CRC.  Aim 1 is to strengthen and expand the CRC and will be achieved by developing a core management team (MT) to improve resource utilization, financial management, to provide assistance to investigators with clinical trials, and to prepare timely management reports.  The Associate Director of Oral Health Disparity Research will provide leadership for increasing dental faculty clinical research.  A Research Subject Advocate (RSA) will ensure that the safety of research subjects is accorded the highest priority. To diversify clinical research, the CRC will develop collaborative research with community health centers and other RCRll clinical research centers, as well as a clinical pharmacology program.  Aim 2 will increase the type and quality of direct research support, which will be accomplished by hiring a biostatistician/epidemiologist with clinical trial experience and a data analyst to meet increasing requests for assistance with clinical study design, study methodology, data management, and manuscript preparation.  Two research assistants, a bilingual research nurse and a community field research nurse, will be added to improve patient recruitment and community outreach, and to accommodate the increasing number of researchers and types of clinical research activities.  In year 02, a bioinformatics manager will be hired to develop and integrate computational tools to facilitate multidisciplinary clinical research.  In year 03, a clinical pharmacologist will be hired to develop and implement clinical pharmacology studies within the CRC.  Aim 3 involves strategies for increasing the number of MMC clinical researchers in medicine and dentistry, including short-term ""seed"" funding to stimulate investigator-initiated research projects, and long-term funding for faculty-developed clinical research projects, which have the potential for extramural funding.  Other faculty development initiatives include:  1) monthly CRC Clinical Science Seminars; 2) interdisciplinary Clinical Research Seminars; 3) an annual symposium on health disparities research; 4) grantsmanship workshops; and 5) courses on clinical research for faculty, residents, and students.  With these enhancements, the CRC will take on a leadership role in the expansion of clinical research at the college and will become a national source of expertise on clinical research targeting health disparities.      The CRC Administrative Core (AC) is responsible for providing leadership, management of the daily operation of the CRC, recruitment of new staff, and for the formulation and implementation of initiatives to enhance clinical research at MMC.  Specific Aim 1 is to strengthen the administrative infrastructure of the CRC and diversify the range of clinical research activities in the CRC by developing initiatives in oral health, community health, clinical pharmacology, and a collaborative clinical research network.  A Core MT will be assembled to improve the management of CRC resources, CRC finances, clinical trials, report preparation, and stakeholder communication.  The Associate Director for Oral Health Research will develop initiatives to expand the utilization of the CRC by the School of Dentistry and increase the number of clinical research studies in the area of oral health disparities.  The RSA will ensure that research subject safety is accorded the highest priority. The Clinical Research Advisory Committee (CRAC) and External Advisory Committee (EAC) involvement in CRC development and evaluation will be strengthened.  A CRC website and other tools for marketing the CRC and communicating with potential clinical investigators will be developed.  Initiatives will also be developed to increase the number of clinical research studies in the areas of health disparity research including cancer, cardiovascular, infectious disease, HIV/AIDS, neurological/behavioral, and infant mortality.  The MT will develop relationships with community health centers to expand CRC activities in population-based, patient-oriented research, and community outreach.  The MT will participate in the planning and implementation of a Clinical Research Network in conjunction with other RCRII CRCs.  A plan for expanding the capacity for clinical pharmacology research will be developed that will include pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenomics, and a clinical pharmacologist will be hired in year 03.  These initiatives will correct the major weaknesses identified by the EAC, will move the CRC towards the long-term objective of General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) status, and ensure that it becomes a national resource for clinical research targeting health disparities.

"What Accounts for Racial Disparties in Colon Cancer                                 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Background:  Racial and socioeconomic          inequalities are thought to be major contributors to differences in health and       disease outcome in the US. National data confirm lower rates of screening,           more advanced disease and higher morbidity and mortality among the poor and          ethnic/racial minorities.  There is a need to understand the role of social          factors, specifically race and SES, as determinants of cancer-related                morbidity and mortality, and to identify their mechanism of action.                  Objectives:  The primary objective of this study is to assess the unique                           effect of race and SES as determinants of differences in incidence, treatment        and disease outcome between black and white with colorectal cancer (CRC).            Another objective is to assess and compare the independent contribution of           other factors such as age, gender, screening compliance, coexistent illnesses        on CRC morbidity and survival among a subset of these CRC patients.  Methods:           This study will have two phases:  1) A retrospective phase will include a)           assessment of incidence and mortality rates for CRC in the state of Alabama          using data from the Alabama Statewide Tumor Registry (ASCR) for a period of 4        to 5 years; b) development of neighborhood measures of SES, based on 1990            census data and, c) matching of cancer cases with SES, based on area of              residence. II) A formative phase during which individual interviews as well as       medical records abstraction will be conducted on a randomly selected subset of       CRC patients. This phase will gather individual-level socioeconomic and              demographic data and information about co-morbidity at the time of diagnosis.        Analyses will assess the association of contextual SES and ethnicity as well         as that of individual SES and other factors on colorectal disparities.

"Reducing Colorectal Cancer in African Americans  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Low-income, underserved African-               Americans have disproportionate colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality.           This is partly due to late-stage diagnosis and low receipt of timely                 screening.  Having a usual source of care is a major predictor of screening;         however, little is known about specific features of those usual sources of           care as they relate to colorectal cancer screening. This proposal assesses           specific characteristics of primary care systems associated with receipt of          timely screening.  Informed by national data and focus groups, a culturally          appropriate community clinic-based intervention will be conducted to promote         colorectal cancer screening.  In striving to help decrease the gap in                screening for African-Americans, this project is consistent with NCI's               Strategic Plan to Reduce Health Disparities.                                                                                                                              The research aims of this proposal are to:  Phase I, 1) Characterize the             population least likely to receive colorectal cancer screening using                 nationally representative data (Medical Expenditure Panel Survey linked with         the National Health Interview Survey--MEPS/NHIS).  2) Examine MEPS/NHIS to           identify barriers and facilitators of colorectal screening in low income and         minority groups in community clinics.  This includes assessment of features of       primary care associated with screening.  In, Phase II, the candidate will use        these findings to develop and pilot test the feasibility and preliminary             effectiveness of a simple low-cost community-clinic based intervention.  This        intervention will be a randomized controlled trial of a personalized targeted        letter to promote colorectal cancer screening, it will be conducted in 360           non-adherent women and men, age 55 and over, from a clinic serving low-income,       predominantly African-American persons in Washington, D.C. The findings from         phase I (on barriers and facilitators of screening and primary care use) will        inform the content of the targeted letter, and the surveys used to assess this       intervention. (Yrs 2-5)                                                                                                                                                   This award will provide the time and resources for structured and applied            educational experiences to ensure the short-term goal of successfully                completing this project, and ultimately of becoming an independent                   investigator.  Major endpoints will be:  1.) Published papers on features of         primary care associated with adherent colorectal screening for low-income            adults; and, on the feasibility of the clinic intervention.  2.) Submission of       an R01; and, 3.) Disseminating findings to those who impact services for low-        income persons.

"Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project is designed to increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans in Northern California through an intervention focused on educating Vietnamese American public and their health care providers. The objective of this study is to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in Vietnamese American men and the fourth in women. The rate of colorectal screening is low among Vietnamese Americans; only 35 percent of Vietnamese have ever had a fecal occult blood test. The aims of this project are: 1) increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 through a multifaceted intervention; and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by following longitudinal cohorts in a controlled trial; 3) identify predictors of screening.   The primary hypotheses are that the proportions of Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 who 1) have ever had a colorectal cancer screening test; or 2) are up-to-date for colorectal cancer screening will increase more in the intervention population than in the control. The intervention will be carried out over 24 months in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties, California with Vietnamese Americans in Harris County, Texas serving as the control population. Building on the ""Pathways"" conceptual framework and our preliminary qualitative and quantitative research findings, the intervention will promote colorectal cancer screening by: 1) reaching Vietnamese Americans through a print and electronic media campaign that will distribute Vietnamese language health education information; and 2) reaching health care providers with Vietnamese-language counseling materials, training videos, and continuing medical education seminars. We will conduct formative research using focus groups to develop culturally appropriate materials (booklets, calendars, posters, and a web site) and products for distribution through Vietnamese-language media (newspaper, television, and radio advertisements). We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing rates of screening using pre- and post intervention surveys. To test the primary hypotheses we will use z-tests to determine if the differences in the change in rates (deltas) between the intervention and control populations are statistically significant. We will also generate logistic regression models to test the independent effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for colorectal cancer screening.

"MEHARRY CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The objective of the Clinical Research Center (CRC) at MMC is to support clinical research to improve the health of African Americans and other populations with health disparities, and to increase the nation's pool of minority physicians and dentists carrying out clinical research. The specific aims are:   1) to strengthen the administrative infrastructure of the CRC and to diversify the clinical research activities in the CRC by developing initiatives in oral health, community health, clinical pharmacology, and a collaborative clinical research network; 2) to increase the type and quality of direct research support available to both junior and experienced clinical research faculty; and 3) to increase the number of medical and dental faculty conducting clinical research using the CRC.  Aim 1 is to strengthen and expand the CRC and will be achieved by developing a core management team (MT) to improve resource utilization, financial management, to provide assistance to investigators with clinical trials, and to prepare timely management reports.  The Associate Director of Oral Health Disparity Research will provide leadership for increasing dental faculty clinical research.  A Research Subject Advocate (RSA) will ensure that the safety of research subjects is accorded the highest priority. To diversify clinical research, the CRC will develop collaborative research with community health centers and other RCRll clinical research centers, as well as a clinical pharmacology program.  Aim 2 will increase the type and quality of direct research support, which will be accomplished by hiring a biostatistician/epidemiologist with clinical trial experience and a data analyst to meet increasing requests for assistance with clinical study design, study methodology, data management, and manuscript preparation.  Two research assistants, a bilingual research nurse and a community field research nurse, will be added to improve patient recruitment and community outreach, and to accommodate the increasing number of researchers and types of clinical research activities.  In year 02, a bioinformatics manager will be hired to develop and integrate computational tools to facilitate multidisciplinary clinical research.  In year 03, a clinical pharmacologist will be hired to develop and implement clinical pharmacology studies within the CRC.  Aim 3 involves strategies for increasing the number of MMC clinical researchers in medicine and dentistry, including short-term ""seed"" funding to stimulate investigator-initiated research projects, and long-term funding for faculty-developed clinical research projects, which have the potential for extramural funding.  Other faculty development initiatives include:  1) monthly CRC Clinical Science Seminars; 2) interdisciplinary Clinical Research Seminars; 3) an annual symposium on health disparities research; 4) grantsmanship workshops; and 5) courses on clinical research for faculty, residents, and students.  With these enhancements, the CRC will take on a leadership role in the expansion of clinical research at the college and will become a national source of expertise on clinical research targeting health disparities.      The CRC Administrative Core (AC) is responsible for providing leadership, management of the daily operation of the CRC, recruitment of new staff, and for the formulation and implementation of initiatives to enhance clinical research at MMC.  Specific Aim 1 is to strengthen the administrative infrastructure of the CRC and diversify the range of clinical research activities in the CRC by developing initiatives in oral health, community health, clinical pharmacology, and a collaborative clinical research network.  A Core MT will be assembled to improve the management of CRC resources, CRC finances, clinical trials, report preparation, and stakeholder communication.  The Associate Director for Oral Health Research will develop initiatives to expand the utilization of the CRC by the School of Dentistry and increase the number of clinical research studies in the area of oral health disparities.  The RSA will ensure that research subject safety is accorded the highest priority. The Clinical Research Advisory Committee (CRAC) and External Advisory Committee (EAC) involvement in CRC development and evaluation will be strengthened.  A CRC website and other tools for marketing the CRC and communicating with potential clinical investigators will be developed.  Initiatives will also be developed to increase the number of clinical research studies in the areas of health disparity research including cancer, cardiovascular, infectious disease, HIV/AIDS, neurological/behavioral, and infant mortality.  The MT will develop relationships with community health centers to expand CRC activities in population-based, patient-oriented research, and community outreach.  The MT will participate in the planning and implementation of a Clinical Research Network in conjunction with other RCRII CRCs.  A plan for expanding the capacity for clinical pharmacology research will be developed that will include pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenomics, and a clinical pharmacologist will be hired in year 03.  These initiatives will correct the major weaknesses identified by the EAC, will move the CRC towards the long-term objective of General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) status, and ensure that it becomes a national resource for clinical research targeting health disparities.

"Colon Cancer Prevention in Low Income Housing Sites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly preventable cancer, yet it is a leading cause of cancer death in the US. Disparities in CRC morbidity and mortality by socio-economic position and race/ethnicity have been documented. While individual health behaviors do not fully explain differentials in mortality by socioeconomic position, they are significant determinants of societal patterns of risk. These patterns reflect the social context, or larger structural forces that shape the texture of people's day-to-day realities, and that include an array of social and material resources that ultimately have profound effects on health. Little research has been conducted to date to examine how best to intervene within a social context, or to determine what settings are best for addressing contextual factors. Low-income housing sites have great potential as a channel for addressing disparities, as many social contextual factors occur in the housing setting. The goal of this project is to evaluate an intervention designed to address colorectal cancer prevention (CRC) through low income housing sites. A key aspect of the intervention is to determine ways in which addressing the social context in low income, ethnically diverse populations may address disparities in CRC prevention.   This study is a randomized controlled trial that will be conducted in 10 diverse low income housing sites; eligible residents will be enrolled in a cohort and followed; housing site will be the unit of randomization and intervention. The intervention conditions are: (1) a social contextual, housing site-based intervention, that addresses individual, organizational, and systems-level factors that influence participation in CRC prevention activities; or (2) minimal treatment control. The primary outcomes are physical activity and participation in colorectal cancer screening. Of note, both interventions will offer equivalent access to CRC screening. A key goal of this project is to determine if adding on-site outreach and contextually focused activities yield greater overall changes in the study outcomes and is more cost-effective, compared to self-help materials plus efforts to reduce barriers to screening access.

"Coverage, Organization of Care, and Colorectal Screening  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Institute of Medicine recently issued a report calling for improvements in the quality of cancer prevention services. Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Colorectal cancer screening could substantially reduce the morbidity and mortality of this disease, yet screening rates are surprisingly low. Insurance coverage and the management practices of health plans may be critical factors if we are to increase screening rates. We propose to analyze data from two national survey samples and to develop a new survey of health plan medical directors to examine insurance coverage and managed care as determinants of colorectal cancer screening. The specific aims of the study are: (1) Using national data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), we will assess rates of colorectal cancer screening before and after the Medicare program instituted first-dollar insurance coverage for colorectal cancer screening in 1998; (2) Using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), we will assess whether colorectal cancer screening rates are higher among Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care health plans compared to those with fee-for-service insurance controlling for other confounding factors. Additionally, we will examine whether disparities in colorectal cancer screening rates for socioeconomic minorities are smaller for managed care enrollees than for others; (3) Using structured interviews of health plan medical directors, we will evaluate and compare the quality management programs of health plans that have high colorectal cancer screening rates and those with lower rates. Results of this study can guide the enactment of health policies that will increase rates of colorectal cancer screening and thereby reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer and its associated morbidity and mortality.

We will conduct formative research using focus groups to develop culturally appropriate materials (booklets, calendars, posters, and a web site) and products for distribution through Vietnamese-language media (newspaper, television, and radio advertisements). We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing rates of screening using pre- and post intervention surveys. To test the primary hypotheses we will use z-tests to determine if the differences in the change in rates (deltas) between the intervention and control populations are statistically significant. We will also generate logistic regression models to test the independent effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for colorectal cancer screening.

"What Accounts for Racial Disparties in Colon Cancer                                 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Background:  Racial and socioeconomic          inequalities are thought to be major contributors to differences in health and       disease outcome in the US. National data confirm lower rates of screening,           more advanced disease and higher morbidity and mortality among the poor and          ethnic/racial minorities.  There is a need to understand the role of social          factors, specifically race and SES, as determinants of cancer-related                morbidity and mortality, and to identify their mechanism of action.                  Objectives:  The primary objective of this study is to assess the unique                           effect of race and SES as determinants of differences in incidence, treatment        and disease outcome between black and white with colorectal cancer (CRC).            Another objective is to assess and compare the independent contribution of           other factors such as age, gender, screening compliance, coexistent illnesses        on CRC morbidity and survival among a subset of these CRC patients.  Methods:           This study will have two phases:  1) A retrospective phase will include a)           assessment of incidence and mortality rates for CRC in the state of Alabama          using data from the Alabama Statewide Tumor Registry (ASCR) for a period of 4        to 5 years; b) development of neighborhood measures of SES, based on 1990            census data and, c) matching of cancer cases with SES, based on area of              residence. II) A formative phase during which individual interviews as well as       medical records abstraction will be conducted on a randomly selected subset of       CRC patients. This phase will gather individual-level socioeconomic and              demographic data and information about co-morbidity at the time of diagnosis.        Analyses will assess the association of contextual SES and ethnicity as well         as that of individual SES and other factors on colorectal disparities.

"Predictors of Cancer Screening in Diverse Practices DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death, overall. Among men, prostrate cancer is third leading cause, and among women, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death. Racial disparity in deaths due to these cancers occur, with black men having higher mortality from prostrate cancer than whites and black women having higher CRC and breast cancer mortality than white women. Although CRC screening reduces mortality, it is underused: in 1999, according to the BRFSS, only 20.6 percent reported fecal occult blood screening (FOBT) within the last year and 33.6 percent reported flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) within the last five years. The Healthy People 2000 goals of 50 percent for FOBT and 40 percent for FS were not met. Breast cancer screening has reached Healthy People 2000 goals overall, but screening among minority and low income women are lower than goals. Primary care physicians are expected to provide a variety of preventive services such as cancer screening and immunizations, in an environment affected by time constraints, frequency of patient visits, changing recommendations and other factors including patient perception of risk, etc. How is cancer screening identified in medical charts and affected by behavioral and other factors (based on survey data) of the patient, provider and system? How does the provision of other preventive services especially cancer screening relate to immunization?      The investigators were funded by an AHRQ R01 award to study barriers and facilitators to adult vaccination. Four strata were sampled: 1) inner-city health centers; 2) Veterans Affairs [VA] clinics; 3) rural; and 4) suburban practices. Use of inner-city practices allows the issues of disparity based on poverty or race to be addressed. The VA has implemented interventions to increase provision of preventive services. For the R01, the investigators conducted medical record reviews (n=810) and clinician, and patient (n = 1007) interviews about adult immunizations, with some cancer screening data. An ATPM-CDC grant allowed collection of similar data in an additional 200 patients. Neither grants included analysis of cancer screening. The investigators propose to: 1) quantify, the CRC, prostate and breast cancer screening rates by demographic and other patient factors; 2) determine main predictors of screening in multivariable analyses; 3) correlate with rates of other preventive services; and 4) identify behavioral factors (based on surveys) affecting screening such as social influences, communication with doctor, access, health habits and status. Without understanding the barriers to prevention from multiple vantage points, the rates of preventive services are unlikely to reach 2010 goals and needless cancer deaths will occur.

"Reducing Colorectal Cancer in African Americans  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Low-income, underserved African-               Americans have disproportionate colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality.           This is partly due to late-stage diagnosis and low receipt of timely                 screening.  Having a usual source of care is a major predictor of screening;         however, little is known about specific features of those usual sources of           care as they relate to colorectal cancer screening. This proposal assesses           specific characteristics of primary care systems associated with receipt of          timely screening.  Informed by national data and focus groups, a culturally          appropriate community clinic-based intervention will be conducted to promote         colorectal cancer screening.  In striving to help decrease the gap in                screening for African-Americans, this project is consistent with NCI's               Strategic Plan to Reduce Health Disparities.                                                                                                                              The research aims of this proposal are to:  Phase I, 1) Characterize the             population least likely to receive colorectal cancer screening using                 nationally representative data (Medical Expenditure Panel Survey linked with         the National Health Interview Survey--MEPS/NHIS).  2) Examine MEPS/NHIS to           identify barriers and facilitators of colorectal screening in low income and         minority groups in community clinics.  This includes assessment of features of       primary care associated with screening.  In, Phase II, the candidate will use        these findings to develop and pilot test the feasibility and preliminary             effectiveness of a simple low-cost community-clinic based intervention.  This        intervention will be a randomized controlled trial of a personalized targeted        letter to promote colorectal cancer screening, it will be conducted in 360           non-adherent women and men, age 55 and over, from a clinic serving low-income,       predominantly African-American persons in Washington, D.C. The findings from         phase I (on barriers and facilitators of screening and primary care use) will        inform the content of the targeted letter, and the surveys used to assess this       intervention. (Yrs 2-5)                                                                                                                                                   This award will provide the time and resources for structured and applied            educational experiences to ensure the short-term goal of successfully                completing this project, and ultimately of becoming an independent                   investigator.  Major endpoints will be:  1.) Published papers on features of         primary care associated with adherent colorectal screening for low-income            adults; and, on the feasibility of the clinic intervention.  2.) Submission of       an R01; and, 3.) Disseminating findings to those who impact services for low-        income persons.

"Colon Cancer Prevention in Low Income Housing Sites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly preventable cancer, yet it is a leading cause of cancer death in the US. Disparities in CRC morbidity and mortality by socio-economic position and race/ethnicity have been documented. While individual health behaviors do not fully explain differentials in mortality by socioeconomic position, they are significant determinants of societal patterns of risk. These patterns reflect the social context, or larger structural forces that shape the texture of people's day-to-day realities, and that include an array of social and material resources that ultimately have profound effects on health. Little research has been conducted to date to examine how best to intervene within a social context, or to determine what settings are best for addressing contextual factors. Low-income housing sites have great potential as a channel for addressing disparities, as many social contextual factors occur in the housing setting. The goal of this project is to evaluate an intervention designed to address colorectal cancer prevention (CRC) through low income housing sites. A key aspect of the intervention is to determine ways in which addressing the social context in low income, ethnically diverse populations may address disparities in CRC prevention.   This study is a randomized controlled trial that will be conducted in 10 diverse low income housing sites; eligible residents will be enrolled in a cohort and followed; housing site will be the unit of randomization and intervention. The intervention conditions are: (1) a social contextual, housing site-based intervention, that addresses individual, organizational, and systems-level factors that influence participation in CRC prevention activities; or (2) minimal treatment control. The primary outcomes are physical activity and participation in colorectal cancer screening. Of note, both interventions will offer equivalent access to CRC screening. A key goal of this project is to determine if adding on-site outreach and contextually focused activities yield greater overall changes in the study outcomes and is more cost-effective, compared to self-help materials plus efforts to reduce barriers to screening access.

"MEHARRY CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The objective of the Clinical Research Center (CRC) at MMC is to support clinical research to improve the health of African Americans and other populations with health disparities, and to increase the nation's pool of minority physicians and dentists carrying out clinical research. The specific aims are:   1) to strengthen the administrative infrastructure of the CRC and to diversify the clinical research activities in the CRC by developing initiatives in oral health, community health, clinical pharmacology, and a collaborative clinical research network; 2) to increase the type and quality of direct research support available to both junior and experienced clinical research faculty; and 3) to increase the number of medical and dental faculty conducting clinical research using the CRC.  Aim 1 is to strengthen and expand the CRC and will be achieved by developing a core management team (MT) to improve resource utilization, financial management, to provide assistance to investigators with clinical trials, and to prepare timely management reports.  The Associate Director of Oral Health Disparity Research will provide leadership for increasing dental faculty clinical research.  A Research Subject Advocate (RSA) will ensure that the safety of research subjects is accorded the highest priority. To diversify clinical research, the CRC will develop collaborative research with community health centers and other RCRll clinical research centers, as well as a clinical pharmacology program.  Aim 2 will increase the type and quality of direct research support, which will be accomplished by hiring a biostatistician/epidemiologist with clinical trial experience and a data analyst to meet increasing requests for assistance with clinical study design, study methodology, data management, and manuscript preparation.  Two research assistants, a bilingual research nurse and a community field research nurse, will be added to improve patient recruitment and community outreach, and to accommodate the increasing number of researchers and types of clinical research activities.  In year 02, a bioinformatics manager will be hired to develop and integrate computational tools to facilitate multidisciplinary clinical research.  In year 03, a clinical pharmacologist will be hired to develop and implement clinical pharmacology studies within the CRC.  Aim 3 involves strategies for increasing the number of MMC clinical researchers in medicine and dentistry, including short-term ""seed"" funding to stimulate investigator-initiated research projects, and long-term funding for faculty-developed clinical research projects, which have the potential for extramural funding.  Other faculty development initiatives include:  1) monthly CRC Clinical Science Seminars; 2) interdisciplinary Clinical Research Seminars; 3) an annual symposium on health disparities research; 4) grantsmanship workshops; and 5) courses on clinical research for faculty, residents, and students.  With these enhancements, the CRC will take on a leadership role in the expansion of clinical research at the college and will become a national source of expertise on clinical research targeting health disparities.      The CRC Administrative Core (AC) is responsible for providing leadership, management of the daily operation of the CRC, recruitment of new staff, and for the formulation and implementation of initiatives to enhance clinical research at MMC.  Specific Aim 1 is to strengthen the administrative infrastructure of the CRC and diversify the range of clinical research activities in the CRC by developing initiatives in oral health, community health, clinical pharmacology, and a collaborative clinical research network.  A Core MT will be assembled to improve the management of CRC resources, CRC finances, clinical trials, report preparation, and stakeholder communication.  The Associate Director for Oral Health Research will develop initiatives to expand the utilization of the CRC by the School of Dentistry and increase the number of clinical research studies in the area of oral health disparities.  The RSA will ensure that research subject safety is accorded the highest priority. The Clinical Research Advisory Committee (CRAC) and External Advisory Committee (EAC) involvement in CRC development and evaluation will be strengthened.  A CRC website and other tools for marketing the CRC and communicating with potential clinical investigators will be developed.  Initiatives will also be developed to increase the number of clinical research studies in the areas of health disparity research including cancer, cardiovascular, infectious disease, HIV/AIDS, neurological/behavioral, and infant mortality.  The MT will develop relationships with community health centers to expand CRC activities in population-based, patient-oriented research, and community outreach.  The MT will participate in the planning and implementation of a Clinical Research Network in conjunction with other RCRII CRCs.  A plan for expanding the capacity for clinical pharmacology research will be developed that will include pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenomics, and a clinical pharmacologist will be hired in year 03.  These initiatives will correct the major weaknesses identified by the EAC, will move the CRC towards the long-term objective of General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) status, and ensure that it becomes a national resource for clinical research targeting health disparities.

"A Population Based Policy Model for Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       In the first CISNET project we developed a population-based Monte Carlo simulation model that evaluates national trends in the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). The HSPH-CISNET Model incorporates age-, sex-, and race-specific trends in CRC risk factors, screening, and treatment, as well as the effects of risk factors and screening on the underlying natural history of colorectal disease and the effectiveness of treatment for patients with diagnosed CRC. The Model currently simulates the US population aged 25 years and older from 1970 to 2020. We have used the Model to examine the relative contribution of changes in risk factors, screening, and treatment to the overall population trends in CRC incidence and mortality.      The purpose of this project is to use the HSPH-CISNET Model to evaluate the population impact of existing cancer control strategies, as well as the impact of strategies on the horizon. Of particular importance is to incorporate the associations between risk factors and screening trends, and to determine the potential impact of disparities in CRC risk and mortality at a population level. Other aims will focus on evaluating the population-level impact of specific risk factor trends, screening modalities, and treatment advancements.  To validate our modeling assumptions, we will use our model structure to simulate the population of Norway, a country that does not have a CRC screening program, in an attempt to re-create their incidence and mortality statistics. We will continue to collaborate with other modeling groups, as well as with the new CRC Coordinating Center and the NCI to focus on questions that apply across all modeling groups. In addition, we propose a concrete plan for making our model more accessible to outside collaborators. This plan involves posting the model structure on a public website, sharing code with established outside investigators, and providing the necessary model support.         ",A Population Based Policy Model for Colorectal Cancer,6960733,U01CA088204,"['computer simulation ', ' cooperative study ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' managed care ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' information dissemination ', ' health care model ', ' mathematical model ', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis ', ' colorectal neoplasm ', ' cancer prevention ', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology ', ' cancer risk ', ' neoplasm /cancer therapy ', ' human population study ', ' human mortality ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' human data ', ' health care policy ', ' Internet ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,U01,2005,226254,0.2624803316036944
"Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening in Rural Kentucky    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Kentucky's Cancer Control Program, Department of Behavioral Science , Kentucky Cancer Program, and community partners are proposing a five-year, community-based, participatory project to increase colorectal cancer screening in rural Appalachian Kentucky (51 counties in eastern Kentucky). Compared with the rest of the U.S., Appalachian Kentucky is medically underserved, economically distressed, and disproportionately burdened with different types of cancer. Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System indicates that approximately 36% of respondents in Appalachian Kentucky reported screening for colorectal cancer (FOBT or flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) in accordance with guidelines of the US Preventive Services Task Force compared to 43.5% in Kentucky and 53% nationwide.  Specific aims of this project are to: 1) Build on a foundation of community partnerships in Appalachian Kentucky and develop a network of community partners capable of fostering colorectal cancer screening; 2) Use results from a pilot project and, in collaboration with community partners, pretest an intervention to increase screening for colorectal cancer in rural Appalachian Kentucky; 3) Recruit primary health care providers for the project, conduct a baseline assessment and implement an intervention to increase colorectal cancer screening in primary care practices; and, 4) Evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in increasing colorectal cancer using a randomized design involving primary care practices assigned to intervention or control based on a readiness to change score and conduct qualitative key informant interviews and process evaluations. Methods for achieving these aims are described in detail in Section D (Research Design and Methods) and include conducting focus groups, recruiting 64 primary care practices (32 control, 32 intervention), delivering an educational intervention consisting of 4 modules, collecting colorectal cancer screening data from 60 medical records/intervention practice, and assessing the impact of the intervention.            ",Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening in Rural Kentucky,6905173,R01CA113932,"['neoplasm /cancer education ', ' community health service ', ' health care service utilization ', ' health care service availability ', ' medical record ', ' primary care physician ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis ', ' colorectal neoplasm ', ' health behavior ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' rural area ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' focus group ', ' rural health ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2005,435044,0.16110621030163522
"What Accounts for Racial Disparties in Colon Cancer                                 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Background:  Racial and socioeconomic          inequalities are thought to be major contributors to differences in health and       disease outcome in the US. National data confirm lower rates of screening,           more advanced disease and higher morbidity and mortality among the poor and          ethnic/racial minorities.  There is a need to understand the role of social          factors, specifically race and SES, as determinants of cancer-related                morbidity and mortality, and to identify their mechanism of action.                  Objectives:  The primary objective of this study is to assess the unique                           effect of race and SES as determinants of differences in incidence, treatment        and disease outcome between black and white with colorectal cancer (CRC).            Another objective is to assess and compare the independent contribution of           other factors such as age, gender, screening compliance, coexistent illnesses        on CRC morbidity and survival among a subset of these CRC patients.  Methods:           This study will have two phases:  1) A retrospective phase will include a)           assessment of incidence and mortality rates for CRC in the state of Alabama          using data from the Alabama Statewide Tumor Registry (ASCR) for a period of 4        to 5 years; b) development of neighborhood measures of SES, based on 1990            census data and, c) matching of cancer cases with SES, based on area of              residence. II) A formative phase during which individual interviews as well as       medical records abstraction will be conducted on a randomly selected subset of       CRC patients. This phase will gather individual-level socioeconomic and              demographic data and information about co-morbidity at the time of diagnosis.        Analyses will assess the association of contextual SES and ethnicity as well         as that of individual SES and other factors on colorectal disparities.

"Reducing Colorectal Cancer in African Americans  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Low-income, underserved African-               Americans have disproportionate colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality.           This is partly due to late-stage diagnosis and low receipt of timely                 screening.  Having a usual source of care is a major predictor of screening;         however, little is known about specific features of those usual sources of           care as they relate to colorectal cancer screening. This proposal assesses           specific characteristics of primary care systems associated with receipt of          timely screening.  Informed by national data and focus groups, a culturally          appropriate community clinic-based intervention will be conducted to promote         colorectal cancer screening.  In striving to help decrease the gap in                screening for African-Americans, this project is consistent with NCI's               Strategic Plan to Reduce Health Disparities.                                                                                                                              The research aims of this proposal are to:  Phase I, 1) Characterize the             population least likely to receive colorectal cancer screening using                 nationally representative data (Medical Expenditure Panel Survey linked with         the National Health Interview Survey--MEPS/NHIS).  2) Examine MEPS/NHIS to           identify barriers and facilitators of colorectal screening in low income and         minority groups in community clinics.  This includes assessment of features of       primary care associated with screening.  In, Phase II, the candidate will use        these findings to develop and pilot test the feasibility and preliminary             effectiveness of a simple low-cost community-clinic based intervention.  This        intervention will be a randomized controlled trial of a personalized targeted        letter to promote colorectal cancer screening, it will be conducted in 360           non-adherent women and men, age 55 and over, from a clinic serving low-income,       predominantly African-American persons in Washington, D.C. The findings from         phase I (on barriers and facilitators of screening and primary care use) will        inform the content of the targeted letter, and the surveys used to assess this       intervention. (Yrs 2-5)                                                                                                                                                   This award will provide the time and resources for structured and applied            educational experiences to ensure the short-term goal of successfully                completing this project, and ultimately of becoming an independent                   investigator.  Major endpoints will be:  1.) Published papers on features of         primary care associated with adherent colorectal screening for low-income            adults; and, on the feasibility of the clinic intervention.  2.) Submission of       an R01; and, 3.) Disseminating findings to those who impact services for low-        income persons.

"Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project is designed to increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans in Northern California through an intervention focused on educating Vietnamese American public and their health care providers. The objective of this study is to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in Vietnamese American men and the fourth in women. The rate of colorectal screening is low among Vietnamese Americans; only 35 percent of Vietnamese have ever had a fecal occult blood test. The aims of this project are: 1) increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 through a multifaceted intervention; and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by following longitudinal cohorts in a controlled trial; 3) identify predictors of screening.   The primary hypotheses are that the proportions of Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 who 1) have ever had a colorectal cancer screening test; or 2) are up-to-date for colorectal cancer screening will increase more in the intervention population than in the control. The intervention will be carried out over 24 months in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties, California with Vietnamese Americans in Harris County, Texas serving as the control population. Building on the ""Pathways"" conceptual framework and our preliminary qualitative and quantitative research findings, the intervention will promote colorectal cancer screening by: 1) reaching Vietnamese Americans through a print and electronic media campaign that will distribute Vietnamese language health education information; and 2) reaching health care providers with Vietnamese-language counseling materials, training videos, and continuing medical education seminars. We will conduct formative research using focus groups to develop culturally appropriate materials (booklets, calendars, posters, and a web site) and products for distribution through Vietnamese-language media (newspaper, television, and radio advertisements). We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing rates of screening using pre- and post intervention surveys. To test the primary hypotheses we will use z-tests to determine if the differences in the change in rates (deltas) between the intervention and control populations are statistically significant. We will also generate logistic regression models to test the independent effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for colorectal cancer screening.

"Colorectal Cancer Screening - Primary Care Strategies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in Western nations. Although a substantial body of research evidence in favor of colorectal cancer screening has been gathered, and despite national guidelines recommending screening to all those over 50 years old, uptake of colorectal screening remains relatively low in the US. In both the USA and the UK primary care is the main point of entry into the health care system, with cancer screening being an integral component of primary care services in both countries. An effective colorectal cancer screening program requires the support of primary care but more evidence regarding primary care-based strategies to improve the delivery and uptake of such a program among lowest-uptake groups is needed. Following the completion of the Evaluation of the UK Colorectal Cancer Screening Pilot, this study examines the role of primary care in recruiting low-uptake groups in the population to FOBT screening. The study will deliver two targeted interventions which address barriers in low-uptake sub-groups identified in our evaluation, and in the literature. Two interventions will be piloted in this exploratory proposal: 1. a primary care-generated paper-based strategy: there has been little research on the use of paper-based strategies which specifically address the expressed barriers of FOBT screening invitees, and it is possible that the combined effect of primary care practice endorsement and the tailored nature of the material will produce an effect; further, paper-based strategies are less resource-intensive, and have the potential for widespread implementation. 2. Nurse facilitators: there is currently considerable interest in the use of appropriately trained nurse facilitators in delivering multifaceted interventions to improve prevention in primary care. Nurse facilitators will be trained in the specific cultural, social and other barriers identified in low-uptake sub-groups, and will be available as an information and support resource for invitees to screening, working closely with primary care practices.         ",Colorectal Cancer Screening - Primary Care Strategies,6965212,R21CA107544,"['mass screening ', ' early diagnosis ', ' neoplasm /cancer education ', ' British Isles ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' health care service utilization ', ' primary care physician ', ' human subject ', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis ', ' colorectal neoplasm ', ' cancer prevention ', ' nurse ', ' health behavior ', ' publication ', ' gender difference ', ' ethnic group ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH,R21,2005,108000,0.12550200149045204
"Colon Cancer Prevention in Low Income Housing Sites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly preventable cancer, yet it is a leading cause of cancer death in the US. Disparities in CRC morbidity and mortality by socio-economic position and race/ethnicity have been documented. While individual health behaviors do not fully explain differentials in mortality by socioeconomic position, they are significant determinants of societal patterns of risk. These patterns reflect the social context, or larger structural forces that shape the texture of people's day-to-day realities, and that include an array of social and material resources that ultimately have profound effects on health. Little research has been conducted to date to examine how best to intervene within a social context, or to determine what settings are best for addressing contextual factors. Low-income housing sites have great potential as a channel for addressing disparities, as many social contextual factors occur in the housing setting. The goal of this project is to evaluate an intervention designed to address colorectal cancer prevention (CRC) through low income housing sites. A key aspect of the intervention is to determine ways in which addressing the social context in low income, ethnically diverse populations may address disparities in CRC prevention.   This study is a randomized controlled trial that will be conducted in 10 diverse low income housing sites; eligible residents will be enrolled in a cohort and followed; housing site will be the unit of randomization and intervention. The intervention conditions are: (1) a social contextual, housing site-based intervention, that addresses individual, organizational, and systems-level factors that influence participation in CRC prevention activities; or (2) minimal treatment control. The primary outcomes are physical activity and participation in colorectal cancer screening. Of note, both interventions will offer equivalent access to CRC screening. A key goal of this project is to determine if adding on-site outreach and contextually focused activities yield greater overall changes in the study outcomes and is more cost-effective, compared to self-help materials plus efforts to reduce barriers to screening access.

"Colorectal Cancer Screening Barriers in American Indians/Alaska Natives    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary: American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) suffer from disproportionate mortality from colorectal cancer and have among the lowest screening rates for any ethnic group (current FOBT = 14%, current endoscopy = 25%), while incidence is rising. Despite their high mortality (49% of AI/AN men with colorectal cancer will die from it; 37% of AI/AN women), no study has yet been conducted to determine the reasons behind their lag in screening behavior, Likewise, no interventions to increase screening have been attempted. Therefore, we propose a systematic, ethnographic assessment of needs and barriers to colorectal cancer screening, as well as knowledge and beliefs about the disease, in a heterogeneous AI/AN group, including many different tribes and urban, rural, and reservation populations. Once we understand needs, barriers, knowledge, and beliefs, we can begin to develop screening programs specific to this population. We plan to work with the Haskell Health Center, the American Indian Heartland Cancer Network, and the American Indian Council of Kansas City to reach both urban and rural communities in Kansas and the Kansas City Metro Area. We will address the following specific aims: (1) To identify what medical staff believe are the greatest needs and barriers to colorectal cancer screening for AI/AN; (2) To identify what AI/AN community members believe are the greatest needs and barriers to colorectal cancer screening; and (3) To understand knowledge and attitudes of AI/AN with regards to colorectal cancer and its screening. Using a Critical Medical Anthropology framework, we will use ethnographic interviews with health center personnel and key informants and focus groups with community members. Our qualitative research will be augmented with quantitative ethnographic techniques, including free lists, pile sorts, and ranking exercises. Relevance: One of the greatest objectives of public health is to decrease health disparities in underserved populations, including ethnic minorities. AI/AN suffer from greater health disparities than any other ethnic minority, including lower rates of cancer screening and disproportionate mortality from all major cancers. We propose a project that will examine needs, barriers, knowledge and attitudes surrounding colorectal cancer and its screening in this population, which can ultimately be used to develop a cancer screening program that addresses the unique needs of this population.           ",Colorectal Cancer Screening Barriers in American Indians/Alaska Natives,7116120,R03CA121828,"['health ', ' interview ', ' neoplasm /cancer ', ' colorectal neoplasm ', ' endoscopy ', ' attitude ', ' behavior ', ' community ', ' urban area ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2006,73500,0.138834163631256

"Colorectal Cancer Screening Patient Navigation for African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans experience higher incidence and greater mortality from colorectal cancer in comparison to non-Hispanic whites. To reduce this disparity, interventions are needed that will increase rates of colorectal cancer screening by this population. Regular screening can reduce both morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer and offers the possibility of early detection and prevention. The primary propose of this study is to develop and test the feasibility of a peer-based navigator intervention for increasing colorectal cancer screening rates for African Americans referred to a no-cost screening program. Initial data collected from the screening program show that 82% of African Americans who were referred to the program failed to complete colorectal cancer screening. The first aim of this study is to identify determinants of colorectal cancer screening for participants referred to this no-cost screening program. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be conducted to identify determinants that influence the decision to, or failure to, participate in colorectal cancer screening. Qualitative research will be guided by the PEN-3 framework and will explore cultural context and its relationship to colorectal cancer screening. The second aim of this study is to develop and pilot test a peer-based navigator intervention to increase screening rates. Findings from the qualitative studies will help inform the development of a peer-based navigator intervention. To test the efficacy of the intervention, two hundred African American men and women meeting the eligibility requirements of the no- cost program will be randomly assigned to the control (standard care) and peer-based navigator conditions. Those in the intervention condition will receive a peer-based navigator who will provide social support and assist participants in overcoming potential barriers. Outcome evaluation will be based on a follow-up telephone survey conducted 3-months after the initial baseline survey as well as payment record verification of self-reported colonoscopy screening. By the completion of this project, we will have tested the feasibility of a peer-based navigator intervention and collected data to plan a larger intervention trial to increase colorectal cancer screening among African Americans.           ",Colorectal Cancer Screening Patient Navigation for African Americans,7384325,R03CA124215,[''],NCI,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R03,2006,65978,0.1694954322086658

"A Pilot Physician-Based Trial to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Chinese    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and the third leading cause of cancer death among Chinese Americans, the largest sub-group of Asian American and Pacific Islanders. Older Chinese Americans, who are mostly immigrants, face unique cultural barriers to screening and have among the lowest CRC screening rates in the U.S. Physician recommendation is the most important determinant of CRC screening in older Chinese; Unfortunately, Chinese seeking care from Chinese-speaking physicians receives CRC screening recommendations less often than those seeing English-speaking providers. The overall goal of this research is to increase CRC screening intentions in Chinese Americans. To accomplish this goal, we have assembled an experienced interdisciplinary, multi-cultural, bilingual team to conduct community primary care-based research guided by Social Cognitive Theory with Chinese physicians and their Chinese patients in the Washington DC and the Philadelphia areas. The objectives are to develop an intervention to improve Chinese physicians skills in culturally appropriate communication about CRC through observational learning, and conduct a pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of this physician-based intervention, and examine the impact of this intervention on CRC screening intentions among asymptomatic Chinese-American patients ages 50 and older who are non-adherent to screening. Four Chinese primary care physicians will be assigned to the intervention or the usual care control group. Physicians in the intervention group will receive (1) culturally appropriate educational materials on CRC screening and communication skills, tool kits for identifying patient barriers, and examples of tracking systems for screening, and (2) two sessions of in-office training on communication with standardized Chinese patients. The main outcome will be CRC screening intentions of 100 non-adherent Chinese American patients aged 50 and older (25 patients per physician) who visit the participating physicians within four months post-intervention. Process evaluation of the feasibility of the intervention and usefulness of the educational materials and in-office training will be conducted with participating physicians. This research is consistent with the NCI's plan to reduce cancer health disparities in minority groups via new intervention research to identify and successfully overcome sociocultural and health system barriers to cancer screening. The proposed study will be the first study to pilot test a culturally appropriate, theoretically-grounded physician intervention to influence Chinese American primary care physicians' recommendation about CRC screening and their patients' intentions for and use of CRC screening. If feasible and acceptable, we will extend the intervention to a large-scale multiple-site randomized trial (R01) to examine the effectiveness of this culturally appropriate physician-based intervention in improving CRC screening rates in Chinese Americans. If proven effective, this intervention will be highly transportable to reach a large physician audience and impact screening rates in the Chinese population.             ",A Pilot Physician-Based Trial to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Chinese,7226893,U01CA114582,[''],NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,U01,2006,79473,0.18317134217396971
"RCT/Increase Colon Cancer Screening/Medicaid Managed Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Disparities persist in the colorectal cancer screening. There is need for practical, widely applicable interventions that could correct these disparities. Through previous work (R01-87776) we have developed a Prevention Care Management (PCM) intervention based on telephone support that increased colon cancer screening rates for low income women visiting community/migrant health centers in New York City almost two fold. The earlier project relied on research staff to recruit patients in community/migrant health center (C/MHC) waiting rooms and to provide the intervention, thus, limiting its transportability and sustainability.   This new project in response to PAR 04-036 will be based in Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MMCOs) which can provide sustainable, widely available infrastructures to support colon cancer screening especially for women who comprise a substantial majority of MMCO enrollees. Our first aim is to expand the scope of PCM to apply to MMCO-enrolled women who seldom visit primary care (outreach) while continuing to provide inreach to more frequent attenders. The second aim is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the expanded PCM intervention to assess its impact on colorectal cancer screening status of low-income women age 50-64 years and to describe the process of Prevention Care Management.    Several unique features of the project should be noted: the identification of women overdue for screening through MMCO claims data which is both practical to sustain and expands the reach of the project to include women who seldom visit primary care; the intervention will be delivered by established MMCO staff, not researchers appearing transiently but cannot sustain the intervention; outcomes will be assessed through MMCO claims data; and multiple representative MMCOs in New York City will be involved. Colon cancer screening will be promoted in the context of other indicated screening for breast and cervical cancer.     Aim three will explore the relationship of characteristics of the women (demographics), of the community/migrant health centers that serve them, and of the MMCOs in which they are enrolled to colorectal cancer screening status including the impact of the intervention. Cost of the intervention and its relationship to increased screening rates will be assessed.

"Colorectal Cancer Screening in a Diverse Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am a primary care physician and researcher, who is committed to understanding and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in cancer.  If granted this award, I will build upon my Master's in Public Health degree and my prior research experience to advance my knowledge and skills through coursework, mentored research, apprentice-style learning and semi-structured training.  The University of Texas Medical Branch is especially committed to improving the health of the diverse and underserved local populations we serve, through high quality patient care and ongoing research and is very supportive of my career development plan.  I have integrated the coursework and research activities so that I can achieve my objectives.  The long-term objective of the proposed research is to explain and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in colorectal cancer disease burden.  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the USA, accounting for ten percent of all cancer deaths.  As with other cancers, African Americans carry an unequal burden from this disease, they have the highest incidence and mortality of all racial/ethnic groups.  There is now good evidence that screening for colorectal cancer reduces mortality from this disease and currently five screening options are recommended.  However, national self-reported screening data suggests that screening levels are poor, especially in minority groups.  The higher mortality in African Americans is thought to be due in part to their higher incidence and in part due to their lower screening rates.  The research in this plan will address this underutilization of screening about which many unanswered questions remain: there is uncertainty about the accuracy of self-reported screening data, especially in minority patients, and there remains a lack of understanding as to the mechanisms through which race/ethnicity affects screening behavior both for African Americans and Hispanics.  In order to address these issues, we plan a series of related aims in a population of African American, Hispanic and Non-Hispanic white patients.  We propose a cross-sectional study utilizing a survey instrument that will be developed especially for use in our racial/ethnically diverse population.  The purpose of the first aim of our study is to determine the prevalence of age and risk appropriate screening in our patient population.  The second aim will determine the accuracy of self-reported information by comparing patient responses to medical record information.  The third aim will examine the mechanisms through which a person's race/ethnicity determines their colorectal cancer screening behavior; we will examine how patient factors, health care system factors and patients' interactions with their environment correlate with self-reported screening behavior.  The fourth aim will involve describing patient preferences for the array of CRC screening tests and systematically evaluating other influences on CRC screening such as health care delivery systems and physician factors and finally integrating all this information to design an intervention to increase CRC screening in all groups and to submit it for an R01 application prior to the end of the award.               ",Colorectal Cancer Screening in a Diverse Population,6869069,K07CA107052,"['aging ', ' death ', ' medical record ', ' neoplasm /cancer ', ' colorectal neoplasm ', ' behavior ', ' ethnic group ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K07,2006,127644,0.24871448739205412
"What Accounts for Racial Disparties in Colon Cancer                                 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Background:  Racial and socioeconomic          inequalities are thought to be major contributors to differences in health and       disease outcome in the US. National data confirm lower rates of screening,           more advanced disease and higher morbidity and mortality among the poor and          ethnic/racial minorities.  There is a need to understand the role of social          factors, specifically race and SES, as determinants of cancer-related                morbidity and mortality, and to identify their mechanism of action.                  Objectives:  The primary objective of this study is to assess the unique                           effect of race and SES as determinants of differences in incidence, treatment        and disease outcome between black and white with colorectal cancer (CRC).            Another objective is to assess and compare the independent contribution of           other factors such as age, gender, screening compliance, coexistent illnesses        on CRC morbidity and survival among a subset of these CRC patients.  Methods:           This study will have two phases:  1) A retrospective phase will include a)           assessment of incidence and mortality rates for CRC in the state of Alabama          using data from the Alabama Statewide Tumor Registry (ASCR) for a period of 4        to 5 years; b) development of neighborhood measures of SES, based on 1990            census data and, c) matching of cancer cases with SES, based on area of              residence. II) A formative phase during which individual interviews as well as       medical records abstraction will be conducted on a randomly selected subset of       CRC patients. This phase will gather individual-level socioeconomic and              demographic data and information about co-morbidity at the time of diagnosis.        Analyses will assess the association of contextual SES and ethnicity as well         as that of individual SES and other factors on colorectal disparities.

"Reducing Colorectal Cancer in African Americans  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Low-income, underserved African-               Americans have disproportionate colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality.           This is partly due to late-stage diagnosis and low receipt of timely                 screening.  Having a usual source of care is a major predictor of screening;         however, little is known about specific features of those usual sources of           care as they relate to colorectal cancer screening. This proposal assesses           specific characteristics of primary care systems associated with receipt of          timely screening.  Informed by national data and focus groups, a culturally          appropriate community clinic-based intervention will be conducted to promote         colorectal cancer screening.  In striving to help decrease the gap in                screening for African-Americans, this project is consistent with NCI's               Strategic Plan to Reduce Health Disparities.                                                                                                                              The research aims of this proposal are to:  Phase I, 1) Characterize the             population least likely to receive colorectal cancer screening using                 nationally representative data (Medical Expenditure Panel Survey linked with         the National Health Interview Survey--MEPS/NHIS).  2) Examine MEPS/NHIS to           identify barriers and facilitators of colorectal screening in low income and         minority groups in community clinics.  This includes assessment of features of       primary care associated with screening.  In, Phase II, the candidate will use        these findings to develop and pilot test the feasibility and preliminary             effectiveness of a simple low-cost community-clinic based intervention.  This        intervention will be a randomized controlled trial of a personalized targeted        letter to promote colorectal cancer screening, it will be conducted in 360           non-adherent women and men, age 55 and over, from a clinic serving low-income,       predominantly African-American persons in Washington, D.C. The findings from         phase I (on barriers and facilitators of screening and primary care use) will        inform the content of the targeted letter, and the surveys used to assess this       intervention.

Major endpoints will be:  1.) Published papers on features of         primary care associated with adherent colorectal screening for low-income            adults; and, on the feasibility of the clinic intervention.  2.) Submission of       an R01; and, 3.) Disseminating findings to those who impact services for low-        income persons.

"Increasing Clorectal Cancer Screening in Rural Kentucky    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Kentucky's Cancer Control Program, Department of Behavioral Science , Kentucky Cancer Program, and community partners are proposing a five-year, community-based, participatory project to increase colorectal cancer screening in rural Appalachian Kentucky (51 counties in eastern Kentucky). Compared with the rest of the U.S., Appalachian Kentucky is medically underserved, economically distressed, and disproportionately burdened with different types of cancer. Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System indicates that approximately 36% of respondents in Appalachian Kentucky reported screening for colorectal cancer (FOBT or flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) in accordance with guidelines of the US Preventive Services Task Force compared to 43.5% in Kentucky and 53% nationwide.  Specific aims of this project are to: 1) Build on a foundation of community partnerships in Appalachian Kentucky and develop a network of community partners capable of fostering colorectal cancer screening; 2) Use results from a pilot project and, in collaboration with community partners, pretest an intervention to increase screening for colorectal cancer in rural Appalachian Kentucky; 3) Recruit primary health care providers for the project, conduct a baseline assessment and implement an intervention to increase colorectal cancer screening in primary care practices; and, 4) Evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in increasing colorectal cancer using a randomized design involving primary care practices assigned to intervention or control based on a readiness to change score and conduct qualitative key informant interviews and process evaluations. Methods for achieving these aims are described in detail in Section D (Research Design and Methods) and include conducting focus groups, recruiting 64 primary care practices (32 control, 32 intervention), delivering an educational intervention consisting of 4 modules, collecting colorectal cancer screening data from 60 medical records/intervention practice, and assessing the impact of the intervention.            ",Increasing Clorectal Cancer Screening in Rural Kentucky,7060396,R01CA113932,"['neoplasm /cancer education ', ' community health service ', ' health care service utilization ', ' health care service availability ', ' medical record ', ' primary care physician ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis ', ' colorectal neoplasm ', ' health behavior ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' rural area ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' focus group ', ' rural health ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2006,474244,0.15465791266756107
"Neighborhood SES and behavioral pathways to risk of colorectal cancer in women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Varying levels of resources and amenities across neighborhoods may plausibly shape health-related behaviors, and thereby may affect individual disease outcomes including colorectal cancer risk. Yet, few studies have examined the specific relation between neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and colorectal cancer incidence, or tested for potential behavioral risk factor mediators, with no studies to date being multilevel or prospective in design. Furthermore, while theory and empirical evidence might suggest the differential uptake of health behaviors within neighborhoods according to selected individual characteristics, such potential interactions have not been previously explored for the association and possible behavioral pathways between neighborhood SES and incident colorectal cancer. The primary goal of our project is to address these knowledge gaps, by using secondary data from the Harvard-based Nurses' Health Study, a well-established, large, prospective cohort of women, while applying statistical methods in combination to enhance validity. The central hypothesis is that neighborhood socioeconomic environments influence several individual-level health behaviors that are risk factors for colorectal cancer, and thereby may affect colorectal cancer risk. These associations are also hypothesized to be modified by one's age, educational attainment, and levels of social networks and social participation. The study's Specific Aims, which apply multilevel models to path analysis and discrete-time survival analysis, and allow for time-varying covariates, are to: 1) estimate the multilevel association between SES of neighborhood of residence and individual colorectal cancer risk, controlling for other neighborhood- and individual-level characteristics; 2) evaluate the extent to which the association between neighborhood SES and individual colorectal cancer risk is mediated by behavioral risk factors; and 3) determine whether the associations between neighborhood SES and individual behavioral risk factors and colorectal cancer risk are modified by one's age, educational attainment, and/or levels of social networks and social participation. Our project is innovative in that it will yield novel empirical evidence regarding the presence of contextual effects of neighborhood SES on individual colorectal cancer risk (applying a multilevel analytic framework); will utilize path analysis to parse out the plausible simultaneous mediating roles of behavioral risk factors for colorectal cancer; and will test for potential effect modifiers of these relations. By contributing to the scientific knowledge base on the contextual determinants of and behavioral risk factor mediators for colorectal cancer incidence, this project could potentially identify more upstream/structural points of intervention to attenuate the incidence of colorectal cancer. The study's efforts may thus translate into more effective reductions in the occurrence of health disparities in colorectal cancer, and reductions in the burden of colorectal cancer in the United States.          ",Neighborhood SES and behavioral pathways to risk of colorectal cancer in women,7226547,R03CA126398,"['colorectal neoplasm ', ' cancer risk ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R03,2006,82000,0.07781030829347083
"Colorectal Cancer Screening Patient Navigation for African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans experience higher incidence and greater mortality from colorectal cancer in comparison to non-Hispanic whites. To reduce this disparity, interventions are needed that will increase rates of colorectal cancer screening by this population. Regular screening can reduce both morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer and offers the possibility of early detection and prevention. The primary propose of this study is to develop and test the feasibility of a peer-based navigator intervention for increasing colorectal cancer screening rates for African Americans referred to a no-cost screening program. Initial data collected from the screening program show that 82% of African Americans who were referred to the program failed to complete colorectal cancer screening. The first aim of this study is to identify determinants of colorectal cancer screening for participants referred to this no-cost screening program. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be conducted to identify determinants that influence the decision to, or failure to, participate in colorectal cancer screening. Qualitative research will be guided by the PEN-3 framework and will explore cultural context and its relationship to colorectal cancer screening. The second aim of this study is to develop and pilot test a peer-based navigator intervention to increase screening rates. Findings from the qualitative studies will help inform the development of a peer-based navigator intervention. To test the efficacy of the intervention, two hundred African American men and women meeting the eligibility requirements of the no- cost program will be randomly assigned to the control (standard care) and peer-based navigator conditions. Those in the intervention condition will receive a peer-based navigator who will provide social support and assist participants in overcoming potential barriers. Outcome evaluation will be based on a follow-up telephone survey conducted 3-months after the initial baseline survey as well as payment record verification of self-reported colonoscopy screening. By the completion of this project, we will have tested the feasibility of a peer-based navigator intervention and collected data to plan a larger intervention trial to increase colorectal cancer screening among African Americans.           ",Colorectal Cancer Screening Patient Navigation for African Americans,7162731,R03CA124215,"['gastrointestinal imaging /visualization ', ' neoplasm /cancer ', ' colorectal neoplasm ', ' endoscopy ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NCI,HENRY M.

"A Population Based Policy Model for Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       In the first CISNET project we developed a population-based Monte Carlo simulation model that evaluates national trends in the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). The HSPH-CISNET Model incorporates age-, sex-, and race-specific trends in CRC risk factors, screening, and treatment, as well as the effects of risk factors and screening on the underlying natural history of colorectal disease and the effectiveness of treatment for patients with diagnosed CRC. The Model currently simulates the US population aged 25 years and older from 1970 to 2020. We have used the Model to examine the relative contribution of changes in risk factors, screening, and treatment to the overall population trends in CRC incidence and mortality.      The purpose of this project is to use the HSPH-CISNET Model to evaluate the population impact of existing cancer control strategies, as well as the impact of strategies on the horizon. Of particular importance is to incorporate the associations between risk factors and screening trends, and to determine the potential impact of disparities in CRC risk and mortality at a population level. Other aims will focus on evaluating the population-level impact of specific risk factor trends, screening modalities, and treatment advancements.  To validate our modeling assumptions, we will use our model structure to simulate the population of Norway, a country that does not have a CRC screening program, in an attempt to re-create their incidence and mortality statistics. We will continue to collaborate with other modeling groups, as well as with the new CRC Coordinating Center and the NCI to focus on questions that apply across all modeling groups. In addition, we propose a concrete plan for making our model more accessible to outside collaborators. This plan involves posting the model structure on a public website, sharing code with established outside investigators, and providing the necessary model support.         ",A Population Based Policy Model for Colorectal Cancer,7115748,U01CA088204,"['computer simulation ', ' cooperative study ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' managed care ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' information dissemination ', ' health care model ', ' mathematical model ', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis ', ' colorectal neoplasm ', ' cancer prevention ', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology ', ' cancer risk ', ' neoplasm /cancer therapy ', ' human population study ', ' human mortality ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' human data ', ' health care policy ', ' Internet ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,U01,2006,211126,0.2624803316036944
"MEHARRY CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The objective of the Clinical Research Center (CRC) at MMC is to support clinical research to improve the health of African Americans and other populations with health disparities, and to increase the nation's pool of minority physicians and dentists carrying out clinical research. The specific aims are:   1) to strengthen the administrative infrastructure of the CRC and to diversify the clinical research activities in the CRC by developing initiatives in oral health, community health, clinical pharmacology, and a collaborative clinical research network; 2) to increase the type and quality of direct research support available to both junior and experienced clinical research faculty; and 3) to increase the number of medical and dental faculty conducting clinical research using the CRC.  Aim 1 is to strengthen and expand the CRC and will be achieved by developing a core management team (MT) to improve resource utilization, financial management, to provide assistance to investigators with clinical trials, and to prepare timely management reports.  The Associate Director of Oral Health Disparity Research will provide leadership for increasing dental faculty clinical research.  A Research Subject Advocate (RSA) will ensure that the safety of research subjects is accorded the highest priority. To diversify clinical research, the CRC will develop collaborative research with community health centers and other RCRll clinical research centers, as well as a clinical pharmacology program.  Aim 2 will increase the type and quality of direct research support, which will be accomplished by hiring a biostatistician/epidemiologist with clinical trial experience and a data analyst to meet increasing requests for assistance with clinical study design, study methodology, data management, and manuscript preparation.  Two research assistants, a bilingual research nurse and a community field research nurse, will be added to improve patient recruitment and community outreach, and to accommodate the increasing number of researchers and types of clinical research activities.  In year 02, a bioinformatics manager will be hired to develop and integrate computational tools to facilitate multidisciplinary clinical research.  In year 03, a clinical pharmacologist will be hired to develop and implement clinical pharmacology studies within the CRC.  Aim 3 involves strategies for increasing the number of MMC clinical researchers in medicine and dentistry, including short-term ""seed"" funding to stimulate investigator-initiated research projects, and long-term funding for faculty-developed clinical research projects, which have the potential for extramural funding.  Other faculty development initiatives include:  1) monthly CRC Clinical Science Seminars; 2) interdisciplinary Clinical Research Seminars; 3) an annual symposium on health disparities research; 4) grantsmanship workshops; and 5) courses on clinical research for faculty, residents, and students.

"An Interactive Colorectal Cancer Screening Promotion Intervention for Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objectives of this study are to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of an interactive, colorectal cancer screening promotion intervention for Latinos tailored by language preference, age, gender and prior screening experience. The specific aims of this study are to identify appropriate colorectal cancer education message elements for a screening promotion intervention intended for low-income Latinos, identify specific elements on which the colorectal cancer education messages for low-income Latinos can be optimally tailored, and assess current and emerging touchscreen technologies that are affordable and appropriate for delivering an interactive, colorectal cancer screening promotion intervention. This study addresses the need for culturally relevant materials to help reduce healthcare disparities for medically underserved communities. The study will conduct formative research with low-income Latino adults in English and Spanish to examine those factors that either impede or promote colorectal cancer screening. The findings of the study will be used subsequently to design messages that can educate Latinos about the importance of screening and early detection of colorectal cancer, the different screening methods, treatment options if colorectal cancer is detected, and the chance of surviving the disease if it is detected and treated early. The study will also conduct a technical evaluation of touchscreens to identify the best technology that is affordable and reliable for use in a touchscreen kiosk. The study's findings on colorectal cancer screening promotion will guide the development of messages for use in an education intervention in Phase II, while the findings of the technical evaluation of touchscreens will inform the decision about a cost-effective touchscreen for use for in Phase II on the development of an interactive multimedia kiosks that can educate and motivate Latinos to obtain colorectal cancer screening. The high colorectal cancer death rates for Latinos represent a significant public health problem. Latino screening rates will have to double this decade to meet the nation's public health goals for colorectal cancer cited in Healthy People 2010.             ",An Interactive Colorectal Cancer Screening Promotion Intervention for Latinos,7270696,R43CA124277,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Digital Video-Interactive ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' Cognitive ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Phase ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Language ', ' Individual ', ' literacy ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Development Plans ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' animation ', ' sound ', ' Technology ', ' preference ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' interactive multimedia ', ' Participant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' technological innovation ', ' Devices ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Gender ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' phase I trial ', ' phase I protocol ', ' phase 1 trial ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' cancer education ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' touchscreen ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' Population ', ' medically underserved ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' commercial application ', ' ']",NCI,VALDEZ AND ASSOCIATES,R43,2007,93457,0.08953371024969003
"Colorectal Cancer Screening Patient Navigation for African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans experience higher incidence and greater mortality from colorectal cancer in comparison to non-Hispanic whites. To reduce this disparity, interventions are needed that will increase rates of colorectal cancer screening by this population. Regular screening can reduce both morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer and offers the possibility of early detection and prevention. The primary propose of this study is to develop and test the feasibility of a peer-based navigator intervention for increasing colorectal cancer screening rates for African Americans referred to a no-cost screening program. Initial data collected from the screening program show that 82% of African Americans who were referred to the program failed to complete colorectal cancer screening. The first aim of this study is to identify determinants of colorectal cancer screening for participants referred to this no-cost screening program. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be conducted to identify determinants that influence the decision to, or failure to, participate in colorectal cancer screening. Qualitative research will be guided by the PEN-3 framework and will explore cultural context and its relationship to colorectal cancer screening. The second aim of this study is to develop and pilot test a peer-based navigator intervention to increase screening rates. Findings from the qualitative studies will help inform the development of a peer-based navigator intervention. To test the efficacy of the intervention, two hundred African American men and women meeting the eligibility requirements of the no- cost program will be randomly assigned to the control (standard care) and peer-based navigator conditions. Those in the intervention condition will receive a peer-based navigator who will provide social support and assist participants in overcoming potential barriers. Outcome evaluation will be based on a follow-up telephone survey conducted 3-months after the initial baseline survey as well as payment record verification of self-reported colonoscopy screening. By the completion of this project, we will have tested the feasibility of a peer-based navigator intervention and collected data to plan a larger intervention trial to increase colorectal cancer screening among African Americans.           ",Colorectal Cancer Screening Patient Navigation for African Americans,7261908,R03CA124215,"['Data Reporting ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Endoscopy ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Flexible sigmoidoscopy ', ' Fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Series ', ' Adenomatous Polyps ', ' polypoid adenoma ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Individual ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Baseline Surveys ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Patients ', ' Polyps ', ' Staging ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' payment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Navigation System ', ' Cancerous ', ' ']",NCI,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R03,2007,67970,0.1694954322086658
"The Influence of Family and Cultural Identity on Informed Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence suggests more research is needed on how best to promote and facilitate informed decision making for colorectal cancer screening among African Americans. The long-term objective of this program of research is to decrease the colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, especially among African Americans through developing community-based interventions and methods to train healthcare providers to effectively promote colorectal cancer screening participation. The purpose of this descriptive, cross-sectional study is to examine the influence of cultural identity, family and colorectal cancer beliefs on an informed decision regarding colorectal cancer screening among African Americans. Recruited for this study will be African American men and women (N=128) 50 years and older who have or have not been screened for colorectal cancer. Informed decision making will be described using questionnaires. Participants will be recruited from the Detroit Community Network Partnership (CNP), a National Cancer Institute funded program to reduce cancer health disparities among African Americans, 50 years and older. Additionally, participants will be recruited from metropolitan Detroit barber and beauty shops and African American organizations. The conceptual model guiding this study is derived from the clinical and research experiences of the PI and the Preventative Health Model (PHM). Two specific aims will be addressed: 1) To examine the relationships among cultural identity, family influence, colorectal cancer beliefs and an informed decision regarding colorectal cancer screening in African Americans; 2) To determine if the relationships among cultural identity, family influence, colorectal cancer beliefs and an informed decision regarding colorectal cancer screening in African American men and women are different. This proposed study has been developed to fill critical gaps in nursing knowledge, cancer prevention and control research. The proposed study is also congruent with the ""Promoting Health and Preventing Disease"" area of research emphasis of the National Institute of Nursing Research to ""identify factors that influence decision-making that results in behavioral changes that promote health and prevent disease and disability."" (National Institute of Nursing Research [NINR], 2006, p. 16). This proposed study is important to public health as it seeks to reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates among African Americans whose rates are the greatest among the US population and by addressing colorectal cancer screening among African Americans whose rates are the lowest of all the US population.           ",The Influence of Family and Cultural Identity on Informed Decision-Making,7329363,F31NR010421,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Endoscopy ', ' Address ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Incidence ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' African ', ' Funding ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Networks ', ' Nurses ', ' Wolves ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Time ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Beauty ', ' Belief ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Participant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Cause of Death ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' time interval ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' family influence ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2007,36812,0.15106548556462218
"Colorectal Cancer in Ethnic Subgroups of U.S. Blacks: Exploring Diversity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among Americans, with 54,650 deaths and 148, 610 new cases expected in 2006. U.S. blacks have the highest CRC incidence and mortality rates of all groups and these disparities have remained startlingly unchanged over decades. As a group, U.S. blacks also demonstrate much lower use of cancer screening and treatment technology, and foreign-born blacks may have even lower rates of CRC screening. The diversity within the population of U.S. blacks is largely unexplored because blacks are commonly treated as a homogenous group, without consideration of possible cultural and behavioral differences associated with national ancestry in the various distinct immigrant communities. Three critical factors-rising numbers of the black immigrant population, lack of research data regarding immigrant blacks, and wide availability of screening tests for CRC-create complex challenges and opportunities for reducing the startling health disparities. In this pilot study we will use mixed qualitative and quantitative research methods to examine CRC related beliefs and behaviors among three ethnic subgroups of U.S. blacks: (1) native U.S.-born, i.e. African American; (2) Haitian-born; and (3) immigrants from English-speaking Caribbean countries [e.g., Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago]. Twenty men and women (aged 50 years or older) from each ethnic subgroup (total sample: 60) will be recruited from medically underserved areas (MUAs) in Hillsborough County, FL, the main geographic site for the ""Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN)"" parent grant. The study is guided by community-based participatory approaches facilitated and informed by community advisors and TBCCN community partners. Eligible and consenting individuals will take part in face-to-face qualitative in-depth interviews and brief quantitative questionnaires read out aloud by a trained interviewer in the community. Qualitative and exploratory quantitative data analyses will focus on: (1) examining and describing cultural beliefs (e.g., health beliefs, cancer fatalism, acculturation, ethnic discrimination), knowledge, awareness and perceived determinants of screening utilization; and (2) assessing the feasibility of recruitment methods among the defined ethnic subgroups. An understanding of ethnic subgroup similarities and differences will be useful in planning future larger scale observational or intervention studies to reduce the disparate burden of CRC.           ",Colorectal Cancer in Ethnic Subgroups of U.S. Blacks: Exploring Diversity,7336916,U01CA114627,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Caribbean natives ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Depth ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Incidence ', ' Ensure ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Jamaica ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', ' uptake ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Immigrant ', ' Community Networks ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Reading ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Trinidad and Tobago ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Awareness ', ' Country ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' ethnic discrimination ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' parent grant ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Understanding Racial and Ethnic Differences in Survival from Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancers are the third most common invasive cancers among men and women in the United States. Improvements in prevention, screening and treatment have resulted in decreasing case-fatality rates from colorectal cancer since the 1980s. Paradoxically, disparities in survival from this cancer especially between Blacks and Whites have widened over time. Although there is no consensus in existing literature, current evidence suggests that factors related to access to health care including socioeconomic differences contribute to these disparities. The goal of the proposed research program is to identify potentially modifiable causes of disparities in cancer survival with a long range goal of reducing or eliminating the disproportionate burden of colorectal cancer among certain patient populations. The specific aims for this project are to: 1) compare colorectal cancer survival rates by race/ethnicity over the period 1993 through 2004; 2) compare the distribution of tumor stage at diagnosis for colorectal cancer by race/ethnicity; 3) examine potential mediators of the relationship of survival and race/ethnicity among colorectal cancer patients; 4) examine the patterns of care of survivors of colorectal cancer; and 5) explore the effect of socioeconomic status on the relationship between race/ethnicity and survival among colorectal cancer patients. This project will be conducted on a large racially diverse cohort comprised of patients 20 years and older diagnosed with colorectal cancer (1993 to 2004) while enrolled in one of four integrated health care systems that are affiliated with the National Cancer Institute-funded Cancer Research Network. This research plan is part of a career development program aimed at providing the training and experience needed for Dr. Doubeni to become an independently funded clinician-investigator focusing on disparities in cancer survival. The objectives of the career development plan are to acquire knowledge and skills in: 1) cancer biology, epidemiology and treatment; 2) advanced research methods; 3) scientific writing; and 4) the translation of research into practice and policy. The career development program will be accomplished through mentoring and targeted advanced courses. The studies encompassed under the proposed research program will make important contributions to our understanding of racial/ethnic differences in cancer survival rates. The proposed project will lay the foundation for the candidate's long-term career goal of designing system-based interventions aimed at eliminating disparities in cancer care and survival, a major objective of HealthyPeople 2010.          ",Understanding Racial and Ethnic Differences in Survival from Colorectal Cancer,7246299,K01CA127118,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Tumor stage ', ' T-Stage ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Caring ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Range ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Research Network ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Foundations ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Chronic ', ' Invasive ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Survivors ', ' Incidence ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Program Development ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K01,2007,141539,0.1517192577714638
"RCT/Increase Colon Cancer Screening/Medicaid Managed Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Disparities persist in the colorectal cancer screening. There is need for practical, widely applicable interventions that could correct these disparities. Through previous work (R01-87776) we have developed a Prevention Care Management (PCM) intervention based on telephone support that increased colon cancer screening rates for low income women visiting community/migrant health centers in New York City almost two fold. The earlier project relied on research staff to recruit patients in community/migrant health center (C/MHC) waiting rooms and to provide the intervention, thus, limiting its transportability and sustainability.   This new project in response to PAR 04-036 will be based in Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MMCOs) which can provide sustainable, widely available infrastructures to support colon cancer screening especially for women who comprise a substantial majority of MMCO enrollees. Our first aim is to expand the scope of PCM to apply to MMCO-enrolled women who seldom visit primary care (outreach) while continuing to provide inreach to more frequent attenders. The second aim is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the expanded PCM intervention to assess its impact on colorectal cancer screening status of low-income women age 50-64 years and to describe the process of Prevention Care Management.    Several unique features of the project should be noted: the identification of women overdue for screening through MMCO claims data which is both practical to sustain and expands the reach of the project to include women who seldom visit primary care; the intervention will be delivered by established MMCO staff, not researchers appearing transiently but cannot sustain the intervention; outcomes will be assessed through MMCO claims data; and multiple representative MMCOs in New York City will be involved.

"Colorectal Cancer Screening in a Diverse Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am a primary care physician and researcher, who is committed to understanding and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in cancer.  If granted this award, I will build upon my Master's in Public Health degree and my prior research experience to advance my knowledge and skills through coursework, mentored research, apprentice-style learning and semi-structured training.  The University of Texas Medical Branch is especially committed to improving the health of the diverse and underserved local populations we serve, through high quality patient care and ongoing research and is very supportive of my career development plan.  I have integrated the coursework and research activities so that I can achieve my objectives.  The long-term objective of the proposed research is to explain and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in colorectal cancer disease burden.  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the USA, accounting for ten percent of all cancer deaths.  As with other cancers, African Americans carry an unequal burden from this disease, they have the highest incidence and mortality of all racial/ethnic groups.  There is now good evidence that screening for colorectal cancer reduces mortality from this disease and currently five screening options are recommended.  However, national self-reported screening data suggests that screening levels are poor, especially in minority groups.  The higher mortality in African Americans is thought to be due in part to their higher incidence and in part due to their lower screening rates.  The research in this plan will address this underutilization of screening about which many unanswered questions remain: there is uncertainty about the accuracy of self-reported screening data, especially in minority patients, and there remains a lack of understanding as to the mechanisms through which race/ethnicity affects screening behavior both for African Americans and Hispanics.  In order to address these issues, we plan a series of related aims in a population of African American, Hispanic and Non-Hispanic white patients.  We propose a cross-sectional study utilizing a survey instrument that will be developed especially for use in our racial/ethnically diverse population.  The purpose of the first aim of our study is to determine the prevalence of age and risk appropriate screening in our patient population.  The second aim will determine the accuracy of self-reported information by comparing patient responses to medical record information.  The third aim will examine the mechanisms through which a person's race/ethnicity determines their colorectal cancer screening behavior; we will examine how patient factors, health care system factors and patients' interactions with their environment correlate with self-reported screening behavior.  The fourth aim will involve describing patient preferences for the array of CRC screening tests and systematically evaluating other influences on CRC screening such as health care delivery systems and physician factors and finally integrating all this information to design an intervention to increase CRC screening in all groups and to submit it for an R01 application prior to the end of the award.               ",Colorectal Cancer Screening in a Diverse Population,7266998,K07CA107052,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K07,2007,123343,0.24871448739205412
"Colon Cancer Prevention in Low Income Housing Sites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly preventable cancer, yet it is a leading cause of cancer death in the US. Disparities in CRC morbidity and mortality by socio-economic position and race/ethnicity have been documented. While individual health behaviors do not fully explain differentials in mortality by socioeconomic position, they are significant determinants of societal patterns of risk. These patterns reflect the social context, or larger structural forces that shape the texture of people's day-to-day realities, and that include an array of social and material resources that ultimately have profound effects on health. Little research has been conducted to date to examine how best to intervene within a social context, or to determine what settings are best for addressing contextual factors. Low-income housing sites have great potential as a channel for addressing disparities, as many social contextual factors occur in the housing setting. The goal of this project is to evaluate an intervention designed to address colorectal cancer prevention (CRC) through low income housing sites. A key aspect of the intervention is to determine ways in which addressing the social context in low income, ethnically diverse populations may address disparities in CRC prevention.   This study is a randomized controlled trial that will be conducted in 10 diverse low income housing sites; eligible residents will be enrolled in a cohort and followed; housing site will be the unit of randomization and intervention. The intervention conditions are: (1) a social contextual, housing site-based intervention, that addresses individual, organizational, and systems-level factors that influence participation in CRC prevention activities; or (2) minimal treatment control. The primary outcomes are physical activity and participation in colorectal cancer screening. Of note, both interventions will offer equivalent access to CRC screening. A key goal of this project is to determine if adding on-site outreach and contextually focused activities yield greater overall changes in the study outcomes and is more cost-effective, compared to self-help materials plus efforts to reduce barriers to screening access.

"Colorectal Cancer Screening Barriers in American Indians/Alaska Natives    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary: American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) suffer from disproportionate mortality from colorectal cancer and have among the lowest screening rates for any ethnic group (current FOBT = 14%, current endoscopy = 25%), while incidence is rising. Despite their high mortality (49% of AI/AN men with colorectal cancer will die from it; 37% of AI/AN women), no study has yet been conducted to determine the reasons behind their lag in screening behavior, Likewise, no interventions to increase screening have been attempted. Therefore, we propose a systematic, ethnographic assessment of needs and barriers to colorectal cancer screening, as well as knowledge and beliefs about the disease, in a heterogeneous AI/AN group, including many different tribes and urban, rural, and reservation populations. Once we understand needs, barriers, knowledge, and beliefs, we can begin to develop screening programs specific to this population. We plan to work with the Haskell Health Center, the American Indian Heartland Cancer Network, and the American Indian Council of Kansas City to reach both urban and rural communities in Kansas and the Kansas City Metro Area. We will address the following specific aims: (1) To identify what medical staff believe are the greatest needs and barriers to colorectal cancer screening for AI/AN; (2) To identify what AI/AN community members believe are the greatest needs and barriers to colorectal cancer screening; and (3) To understand knowledge and attitudes of AI/AN with regards to colorectal cancer and its screening. Using a Critical Medical Anthropology framework, we will use ethnographic interviews with health center personnel and key informants and focus groups with community members. Our qualitative research will be augmented with quantitative ethnographic techniques, including free lists, pile sorts, and ranking exercises. Relevance: One of the greatest objectives of public health is to decrease health disparities in underserved populations, including ethnic minorities. AI/AN suffer from greater health disparities than any other ethnic minority, including lower rates of cancer screening and disproportionate mortality from all major cancers. We propose a project that will examine needs, barriers, knowledge and attitudes surrounding colorectal cancer and its screening in this population, which can ultimately be used to develop a cancer screening program that addresses the unique needs of this population.           ",Colorectal Cancer Screening Barriers in American Indians/Alaska Natives,7232129,R03CA121828,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Endoscopy ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Reservations ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Rate ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Female ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Flexible sigmoidoscopy ', ' Fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Kansas ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' male ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Medical Staff ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Missouri ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Native Americans ', ' Patients ', ' Anthropology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Medical center ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Native Alaskan ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' social ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Rural Community ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' urban native american ', ' urban American Indian ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2007,71369,0.138834163631256
"Modeling Effective Health Policies for Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Despite recent declines in both incidence and mortality, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States. The present project aims to provide guidance on how to further reduce the burden of this disease, considering interventions based on primary prevention, screening, and treatment improvement. To this end, a wide range of issues is addressed in order to provide an overview of relative effects of alternative intervention policies. This study is a collaboration between Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Erasmus University (Erasmus MC) in Rotterdam.      We use a population based microsimulation model (MISCAN-Colon) to assess the effect of individual interventions and combinations on the burden of CRC. MISCAN was originally developed by Erasmus MC to assess screening interventions and has been extended in our current project to incorporate changes in risk factors, chemoprevention and treatment efficacy. This model simulates the full dynamic US population which makes it particularly suitable for assessment of effects of interventions on a population level, including effects on CRC incidence and mortality, and also on quality of life, demands for medical capacity and economic burden over time.       In order to make reliable projections for the future, it is necessary to understand to what extent the decline in CRC incidence and mortality is attributable to changes in exposures to ""lifestyle"" factors, changes in use of screening, changes in treatment, or combinations of these factors. Therefore, the specific aims are to use the MISCAN microsimulation model to 1.) Estimate the absolute and relative contribution of changing lifestyle factors, screening, and improved therapy on the observed trends in CRC incidence and mortality in the United States 1975-2002; and then to explore future scenarios to 2.) Evaluate the potential impact of current and newly developing technologies on lifestyle interventions, chemoprevention, screening, and treatment improvement on future trends in CRC incidence and mortality in the US and 3.) Translate the impact of implementation of interventions found to be effective in reducing incidence and mortality under Aim 2, into the burden of colorectal cancer also with respect to life years gained, quality of life, required medical capacity and economic burden. Aims 2 and 3 will also consider targeted intervention for individuals with increased risk due to familial predisposition.      The results from these analyses can be used to inform decisions of directing medical and public health resources to the most effective interventions in the appropriate risk groups.

"Improving colorectal cancer screening: enhancing systems and health communication Colorectal cancer, although preventable, is the second leading cause of cancer in the U.S. African Americans experience higher CRC morbidity and mortality compared to other populations. Racial disparities in CRC outcomes are largely attributed to lower CRC screening rates for African Americans. Of recommended CRC screening methods, the least expensive is yearly fecal immunochemical test (FIT)or fecal occult blood test (FOBT). Both are self-administered home tests. Increasing CRC early detection has been limited by low rates of FOBT/FIT completion and return. This feasibility study examines whether 1) re-packaging home-based FIT kits will address barriers to kit use among African American adults age 50 or older in Guilford County, North Carolina and 2) it is possible to develop and maintain a community-wide, integrated system (CRC Safety Net)to assure timely and coordinated FIT distribution, collection, results notification and referral services regardless of patient insurance status or ability to pay.The feasibility of the project is enhanced by the active involvement of health care and public health agencies as collaborators in this project.

"Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Amercians Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, affecting both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups. The majority of these deaths could be prevented since CRC, when discovered early, is highly treatable and screening that leads to removal of adenomatous polyps decreases CRC incidence by 75% to 90%. Nationally, in 2002, only 50% of adults aged 50 or older reported having had any screening test in the recommended intervals. Both CRC incidence and mortality rates are higher among African Americans than any other racial group. These health disparities are due, in part, to delay in diagnosis resulting in advanced stage disease at presentation. Lower rates of CRC screening participation among African Americans contribute to this burden. Interactive computer-based interventions effectively promote health behavior change by delivering individualized, or tailored, health information and counseling. In pilot testing, a tailored, interactive computer intervention designed to promote CRC screening among African Americans resulted in increased CRC knowledge and higher rates of fecal occult blood testing. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a tailored, interactive computer intervention to promote CRC screening by comparing it to, and combining it with, a physician recommendation, which has been found to be a significant predictor of CRC screening. A sample of 1248 African American men and women who are being seen in two Midwestern primary care networks and who are non-adherent to colon cancer screening guidelines will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) a CRC screening brochure; 2) an interactive computer intervention; or 3) the interactive computer intervention plus the brochure. Both process and outcome variables will be examined. Rates of adherence to fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are primary outcomes examined at 6 and 15 months. Logistic regression models will be used to test intervention effects separately for two outcomes, fecal occult blood testing (initial and repeat) and endoscopic screening, while adjusting for potentially confounding covariates. Mediators and moderators of intervention effects and changes in health beliefs related to the interventions also will be determined.         ",Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Amercians,7234394,R01CA115983,"['Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Progress Review Group ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Adoption ', ' Guidelines ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' minority health ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Adenomatous Polyps ', ' polypoid adenoma ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' African ', ' uptake ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Staging ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Sigmoidoscopy ', ' Proctosigmoidoscopy ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Week ', ' Clinic ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' cancer risk ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Genus Cola ', ' Cola ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Today ', ' Gender ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Documentation ', ' Colon ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Computers ', ' ']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2007,477195,0.27224856090747285
"Cancer Control Dissemination to Asian Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of our proposal is to disseminate an evidence-based intervention designed for one Asian ethnic population to a different Asian ethnic population with overlapping cultural and health beliefs. In collaboration with International Community Health Services (ICHS), a community agency serving many Asian ethnic groups, we have three specific objectives for the proposed research:  Replicate an effective colorectal cancer (CRC) screening intervention for Vietnamese Americans that was originally designed for Chinese Americans.  Evaluate the dissemination of this replicated intervention through a quasi-experimental study.  Collect and examine dissemination process data. Based on principles from Diffusion of Innovation Theory, we proposed to replicate an intervention with a 42% effect size. The replicated intervention will consist of a Vietnamese language video and bilingual pamphlet. We will translate and dub into Vietnamese our award-winning Chinese-language video, ""Being a Winner in Life: How to Prevent Colorectal Cancer."" The Chinese/English pamphlet will also be translated into Vietnamese. To provide feedback on the translated video script and pamphlet, we will convene 4 focus groups with Vietnamese men and women. Subsequently, we will introduce these materials to the intervention clinic staff at in-service training presentations and specifically recommend that intervention clinic medical assistants distribute the intervention materials. To evaluate the dissemination of this replicated intervention, our quantitative analysis will examine the Reach and Effectiveness based on the RE-AIM framework through a quasi-experimental study over an 18-month period. There are 919 and 802 age-eligible Vietnamese patients at the intervention and control clinic respectively. To determine the Effectiveness of the intervention, the primary outcome will be changes in CRC screening adherence rates at the intervention and control clinics. We will randomly select 25% of the patients from each clinic for pre- and post-intervention chart audits and use the Generalized Estimating Equation to model CRC screening adherence at the two clinics at pre- and post-intervention.

"Neighborhood SES and behavioral pathways to risk of colorectal cancer in women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Varying levels of resources and amenities across neighborhoods may plausibly shape health-related behaviors, and thereby may affect individual disease outcomes including colorectal cancer risk. Yet, few studies have examined the specific relation between neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and colorectal cancer incidence, or tested for potential behavioral risk factor mediators, with no studies to date being multilevel or prospective in design. Furthermore, while theory and empirical evidence might suggest the differential uptake of health behaviors within neighborhoods according to selected individual characteristics, such potential interactions have not been previously explored for the association and possible behavioral pathways between neighborhood SES and incident colorectal cancer. The primary goal of our project is to address these knowledge gaps, by using secondary data from the Harvard-based Nurses' Health Study, a well-established, large, prospective cohort of women, while applying statistical methods in combination to enhance validity. The central hypothesis is that neighborhood socioeconomic environments influence several individual-level health behaviors that are risk factors for colorectal cancer, and thereby may affect colorectal cancer risk. These associations are also hypothesized to be modified by one's age, educational attainment, and levels of social networks and social participation. The study's Specific Aims, which apply multilevel models to path analysis and discrete-time survival analysis, and allow for time-varying covariates, are to: 1) estimate the multilevel association between SES of neighborhood of residence and individual colorectal cancer risk, controlling for other neighborhood- and individual-level characteristics; 2) evaluate the extent to which the association between neighborhood SES and individual colorectal cancer risk is mediated by behavioral risk factors; and 3) determine whether the associations between neighborhood SES and individual behavioral risk factors and colorectal cancer risk are modified by one's age, educational attainment, and/or levels of social networks and social participation. Our project is innovative in that it will yield novel empirical evidence regarding the presence of contextual effects of neighborhood SES on individual colorectal cancer risk (applying a multilevel analytic framework); will utilize path analysis to parse out the plausible simultaneous mediating roles of behavioral risk factors for colorectal cancer; and will test for potential effect modifiers of these relations. By contributing to the scientific knowledge base on the contextual determinants of and behavioral risk factor mediators for colorectal cancer incidence, this project could potentially identify more upstream/structural points of intervention to attenuate the incidence of colorectal cancer. The study's efforts may thus translate into more effective reductions in the occurrence of health disparities in colorectal cancer, and reductions in the burden of colorectal cancer in the United States.          ",Neighborhood SES and behavioral pathways to risk of colorectal cancer in women,7289288,R03CA126398,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Social Network ', ' Data ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Geography ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Physical activity ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' Meat ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Attenuated ', ' Shapes ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Knowledge ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Behavior ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' interest ', ' cancer risk ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Genus Cola ', ' Cola ', ' Rectal Cancer ', ' Rectum Carcinoma ', ' Rectum Cancer ', ' Rectal Carcinoma ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' social ', ' Censuses ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' Colon ', ' Accounting ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R03,2007,79622,0.07781030829347083
"Patient Navigation for CRC Screening with Low-Income Minorities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal Cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates are highest in African Americans (AA's) compared with all other ethnic groups. One factor that may contribute to this trend is the lower rate of participation in CRC screening among AAs, which is critical to the prevention and early detection of CRC. Recent data indicate that the removal of precancerous polyps (via colonoscopy) decreases CRC incidence by 75-90 percent. Despite the implementation of national policy changes to increase CRC screening (through Medicaid/Medicare reimbursement for CRC screening and easier ""open"" access to colonoscopy) adherence remains alarmingly low. Our preliminary data show that, even after implementation of standard patient navigation (SPN) (i.e., assisting patients with making/keeping their appointments), only 40 percent of low-income minorities followed-through on their physician recommendation. Guided by Cognitive-Behavioral Social Learning Theory as a conceptual framework and cultural targeting as an intervention strategy, the proposed randomized clinical trial will investigate integrating within SPN a targeted discussion of intrapersonal and cultural barriers to colonoscopy (i.e., fear, lack of knowledge, medical mistrust, fatalism and fear) prevalent with low-income AAs. Based on research on source credibility and reference group-based social identity theory, we will also explore navigator status as a peer on the impact of culturally targeted PN. Thus, we will compare three PN strategies: SPN carried out by a professional navigator, Culturally Targeted PN carried out by a professional (CTPN-Pro) and Culturally Targeted PN carried out by a peer who has undergone colonoscopy (CTPN-Peer). Specific Aims: Aim 1: Compare the efficacy of SPN, CTPN-Pro, and CTPN-Peer on adherence to colonoscopy CRC screening in average risk, low-income AAs who have a primary care physician referral for colonoscopy. Aim 2: Explore potential mechanisms (i.e., mediators) underlying the beneficial effects of CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer and to examine for whom the CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer are most effective (i.e., moderators). Aim 3: Compare the cost effectiveness of CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer. Cost effectiveness will be examined in terms of direct clinical costs of screening (i.e., savings associated with more efficient use of personnel, space, and equipment) and patient costs (i.e., costs of CRC treatment and the opportunity costs to the patient per life-year saved). Results from the proposed work will facilitate the broad dissemination of PN to reduce ethnic and racial health disparities in CRC incidence mortality and will advance our understanding of PN.           ",Patient Navigation for CRC Screening with Low-Income Minorities,7320364,R01CA120658,"['cost effectiveness ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Equipment ', ' programs ', ' Colon, Rectum ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Polypectomy ', ' PLYPCMY ', ' American ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' social ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' opportunity cost ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' coping ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Flexible sigmoidoscopy ', ' Fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Guidelines ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Incidence ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Policies ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Appointment ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2007,621847,0.2507459494330408
"A Physician-Based Trial to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Chinese    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and the third leading cause of cancer death among Chinese Americans, the largest sub-group of Asian American and Pacific Islanders. Older Chinese Americans, who are mostly immigrants, face unique cultural barriers to screening and have among the lowest CRC screening rates in the US. Physician recommendation is the most important determinant of ZRC screening in older Chinese. Unfortunately, Chinese seeking care from Chinese-speaking physicians eceive CRC screening recommendations less often than those seeing English-speaking providers. We have assembled an experienced interdisciplinary, multi-cultural, bilingual team to conduct community primary care-based research guided by the Social Cognitive Theory with Chinese physicians and their Chinese patients in the Washington DC and the Philadelphia areas. The specific aims are to develop an intervention to mprove Chinese physicians' skills in culturally appropriate communication about CRC through observational earning, and conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of this physician-based intervention on CRC screening rates among their asymptomatic Chinese-American patients ages 50 and older who are non-adherent to screening. There are more than 110 Chinese physicians in our area. We have conducted formative work with 54 Chinese American primary care physicians (PCP's) to understand their barriers to CRC screening. Results from this formative work have been used to inform the intervention. Thirty Chinese PCP's will be randomized to the intervention or the usual care group. Physicians in the intervention group will receive (1) mailed culturally appropriate educational materials on CRC screening and communication skills, tool kits for identifying patient barriers, and examples of tracking systems for screening and (2) two sessions of in-office training with standardized Chinese patients to increase skills and self-efficacy for making screening recommendations. We will also audio-tape a sample of encounters to understand actual communication about CRC screening. Preliminary results from an NCI-funded pilot study awarded since the last submission show that the mailed materials and in-office training are feasible and acceptable to Chinese physicians. The main outcome will be CRC screening rates of 600 non-adherent Chinese American patients aged 50 and older (20 per physician) one year post-intervention. This research is consistent with the NCI's plan to reduce cancer health disparities in minority groups via new intervention research to identify and successfully overcome sociocultural and health system barriers to cancer screening. The proposed research will be the first study to use a culturally appropriate, theoretically-grounded physician intervention to improve CRC screening rates in Chinese Americans. If effective, this intervention will be highly transportable and have broad reach to physician audiences and increase screening in the growing Chinese population. This approach should also be broadly portable to developing culturally appropriate primary care cancer control interventions in other minority groups.                 ",A Physician-Based Trial to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Chinese,7316692,R01CA121023,"['Staging ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"A Population Based Policy Model for Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       In the first CISNET project we developed a population-based Monte Carlo simulation model that evaluates national trends in the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). The HSPH-CISNET Model incorporates age-, sex-, and race-specific trends in CRC risk factors, screening, and treatment, as well as the effects of risk factors and screening on the underlying natural history of colorectal disease and the effectiveness of treatment for patients with diagnosed CRC. The Model currently simulates the US population aged 25 years and older from 1970 to 2020. We have used the Model to examine the relative contribution of changes in risk factors, screening, and treatment to the overall population trends in CRC incidence and mortality.      The purpose of this project is to use the HSPH-CISNET Model to evaluate the population impact of existing cancer control strategies, as well as the impact of strategies on the horizon. Of particular importance is to incorporate the associations between risk factors and screening trends, and to determine the potential impact of disparities in CRC risk and mortality at a population level. Other aims will focus on evaluating the population-level impact of specific risk factor trends, screening modalities, and treatment advancements.  To validate our modeling assumptions, we will use our model structure to simulate the population of Norway, a country that does not have a CRC screening program, in an attempt to re-create their incidence and mortality statistics. We will continue to collaborate with other modeling groups, as well as with the new CRC Coordinating Center and the NCI to focus on questions that apply across all modeling groups. In addition, we propose a concrete plan for making our model more accessible to outside collaborators. This plan involves posting the model structure on a public website, sharing code with established outside investigators, and providing the necessary model support.         ",A Population Based Policy Model for Colorectal Cancer,7278202,U01CA088204,"['Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' red meat consumption ', ' Calendar ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' CISNET ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' sex ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Adoption ', ' Future ', ' Natural History ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Postmenopause ', ' postmenopausal ', ' post-menopausal ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Incidence ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Numbers ', ' Policies ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Hormone replacement therapy ', ' Hormone Replacement Rx ', ' Norway ', ' Simulate ', ' Patients ', ' Smoker ', ' Non-smoker ', ' nonsmoker ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Calibration ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' member ', ' Controlled Study ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' computerized ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' aged ', ' case-based ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2007,387627,0.2624803316036944
"Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. We will use the Pathways Framework, Community-Based Participatory Research process, and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to guide our approach to the intervention, community participation, and dissemination. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a CRC LHW + Media intervention in increasing CRC screening among Vietnamese Americans aged 50 to 74 who have never had a CRC screening test, 2) identify predictors of CRC screening, and 3) evaluate the process of community participation. Following formative research using a cognitive testing approach to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials and survey instruments, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial among Vietnamese Americans aged 50-74 in Santa Clara County California, who have never had a CRC screening test prior to recruitment. We will follow two longitudinal cohorts among whom we will conduct a pre-intervention survey of participants' knowledge, intention, and behavior as regards CRC screening; implement CRC screening educational sessions in an experimental group and nutrition educational sessions in a comparison group; and conduct a post-intervention survey. Each of the two cohorts will include 150 men and 150 women to have a total sample size of 600. The media intervention component will distribute Vietnamese-language health education materials through print and electronic media. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the frequency of screening using pre- and post-intervention surveys. To test our primary hypothesis regarding the effects of the intervention on screening activity, we will use Z-tests. We will also employ logistic regression models to test the effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for CRC screening. In addition, we will conduct process evaluation of the intervention and community participation. If this intervention is found to be effective, this LHW model could be applied in health promotion programs to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans and evaluated in other behavioral objectives and settings to reduce health disparities in other poor and underserved populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Relative to non-Hispanic whites, Vietnamese Americans are both poorer and less well medically served and have special language and cultural issues related to cancer screening that cannot be addressed though interventions aimed at the general population. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. If this intervention is found to be effective, it could be applied in other health promotion programs throughout the United States to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans. In addition, this LHW model could be evaluated in other populations, such as other racial and ethnic, poor, or immigrant communities; in other behavioral objectives, such as other forms of cancer, cardiovascular health, or tobacco, diabetes and obesity control; and in other settings, such as community health clinics and hospitals.

"Understanding Mechanisms of Ethnic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a rich literature documenting racial and ethnic disparities in the trajectory of cancer care and outcomes. Through analyses of tumor registry and Medicare data, the Principal Investigator and co-investigators have begun to uncover explanatory mechanisms or pathways underlying such disparities. We and others have identified disparities in survival after a diagnosis of cancer, much of which can be explained by delays in diagnosis leading to more advanced stage at diagnosis, and also by less than adequate treatment. There has also been considerable research on patient-level, physician level, and system- level factors that contribute to disparities in the trajectory of care. In this application we will conduct explanatory analyses with Medicare claims data to identify the mechanisms underlying racial disparities in stage of diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC), with a focus on the role of CRC screening among older adults. We will also develop methods to measure the performance of individual primary care physicians in providing CRC screening for patients. Of particular interest is how individual physicians' performance contributes to racial disparities in screening use. Aim 1: Determine the rate of screening for colorectal cancer in black and white men and women 65- 75 enrolled in fee for service Medicare in Michigan, New Jersey and Texas from 2001 through 2007. Aim 2: Determine the effect of other subject level (predisposing, enabling, and need) and environment level characteristics of CRC screening and determine the effect of continuity of care with a primary care physician (PCP) on receipt of CRC screening. Aim 3: Describe the variation among PCPs in use of CRC screening and determine how much of the race disparity in CRC screening is explained by PCP as opposed to patient characteristics. Aim 4: Examine the effects of provider characteristics (years in practice, age, volume of cases, primary specialty board certification, affiliation with academic medical centers, etc.) and medical system characteristics (PCPs per capita, gastroenterologists per capita) on the likelihood of CRC screening and also stratified by subjects' race. There are a number of options available to Medicare to promote health and reduce health disparities among its beneficiaries. The results of the mechanistic analyses in this application will allow for the design of interventions targeting the specific points in the trajectory of care that contribute to ethnic disparities in CRC screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the U.S., colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most frequently diagnosed but second leading cause of death among cancers. We will study Medicare data to understand better the reasons for racial disparities in CRC screening rates. With this information, Medicare will be able to design and implement interventions to promote health and reduce health disparities among its beneficiaries.          ",Understanding Mechanisms of Ethnic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Screening,7499494,R01CA134275,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Board Certification ', ' Data ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' beneficiary ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Gastroenterologist ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New Jersey ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Native Americans ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' programs ', ' Specialty Boards ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Modality ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' social ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' tumor ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R01,2008,313325,0.27898437644292134
"CBPR Strategies to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Ohio Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): a disproportionate burden of CRC incidence and mortality, mainly due to lower utilization of recommended CRC screening tests. The Appalachian region of Ohio suffers from this burden of disease in addition to higher poverty, lower employment, and lower educational levels. To address this cancer health disparity, our health disparities research team at The Ohio State University (OSU) in partnership with four Appalachia-based community coalitions have used community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods to design and pilot test two interventions intended to increase CRC screening rates in one Appalachian county (Phase 1).  The goal of this application is to test these CRC screening interventions in 12 Ohio Appalachian counties (Phase 2) in preparation for a full-scale dissemination trial (Phase 3) in 6 additional Appalachian states within the Appalachia Community Cancer Network (ACCN).      The specific aims of this Phase 2 proposal are to: 1) utilize CBPR methods to refine specific county-level media campaigns and clinic-based messages about CRC screening (entitled ""Get Behind Your Health!"") or an attention control message (a healthy eating campaign entitled ""PEACHES"") in 12 Ohio Appalachia counties; 2) implement and test, using a group-randomized design, a staggered county-wide intervention program that compares county-specific media campaigns featuring local CRC survivors, clinic-specific charter reminder systems, and a combination of the two strategies in 6 randomly selected intervention counties to the same campaign strategies in 6 randomly selected attention control counties using county specific healthy eating campaigns featuring local farmers and educational material placed in clinics; 3) utilize process (convenience samples of county residents) and outcome evaluation (4 independent cross-sectional surveys of residents of each county) strategies to assess the efficacy of each strategy on improving CRC screening rates; and 4) utilize the results, to plan the dissemination of the intervention into 36 Appalachian counties in 6 additional states of the ACCN in a subsequent Phase 3 study.      All specific aims will be carried out using CBPR principles, in full partnership with these four Ohio Appalachian community-based cancer coalitions, and will be guided by an underlying theoretical framework of the Transtheoretical Model, in conjunction with three behavioral theories relevant to behavior change (Social Cognitive Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action, and Attitude Accessibility Theory).  The results of this study, thus, will have immediate impact in these Appalachian counties, as the community will be able to institutionalize successful strategies into existing county-wide health campaigns.          ",CBPR Strategies to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Ohio Appalachia,7493882,R24MD002785,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Employment ', ' Address ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Preparation ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Phase ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Incidence ', ' Evaluation ', ' farmer ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Phase III Clinical Trials ', ' phase III trial ', ' phase III protocol ', ' phase 3 trial ', ' Phase 3 Clinical Trials ', ' Ohio ', ' Poverty ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' intervention program ', ' Media Campaign ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Modality ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' County ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' dissemination trial ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' ']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2008,592595,0.18648440451113946
"Tailored Interactive Multimedia to Reduce Colorectal CA Screening Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interactive multimedia computer programs (IMCPs) show promise as a way of delivering personally tailored (PT) information to enhance cognitive mediators of health behavior and improve patient outcomes. However, it is unclear whether PT IMCPs can be deployed in primary care offices to increase cancer screening uptake and eliminate ethnic disparities in uptake by providing PT information in each user's preferred language. Aims/Hypotheses: We will compare changes in CRC screening cognitive mediators (self- efficacy, perceived barriers, and readiness) and uptake resulting from an IMCP  PT to enhance the key cognitive mediators and targeted to patients' self-identified ethnicity - with changes resulting from a non- tailored ""electronic leaflet"" control IMCP. The experimental and control IMCPs will each be offered in English and Spanish versions. We hypothesize that, compared with the appropriate control condition (English, Spanish, or both combined): (1) the English version of the PT IMCP will enhance the cognitive mediators of CRC screening behavior for English-speaking Hispanics and non-Hispanics; (2) there will be similarly favorable changes in these mediators for Hispanics using the Spanish version of the PT IMCP; (3) deployment of the PT IMCP will provide evidence of elimination of disparities in CRC screening between Hispanic and non-Hispanic subjects via its relative impact on the cognitive mediators in these groups; and (4) the PT IMCP (English and Spanish combined) will increase CRC screening uptake in Hispanics and non-Hispanics (considered separately) via changes in the cognitive mediators. Methods: Randomized controlled trial of 2 groups, comparing a PT (to the cognitive mediators) CRC screening IMCP offered in both English and Spanish versions and deployed before a primary care office visit with a non-tailored ""electronic leaflet"" CRC screening IMCP (control) also offered in both English and Spanish. Screening methods targeted will be fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. Primary outcomes will be CRC screening uptake, self- efficacy, perceived barriers, and readiness. Implications: Our findings will determine whether an IMCP that is PT to cognitive mediators of screening behavior and deployed in primary care offices prior to previously scheduled visits can activate patients of various ethnicities to undergo CRC screening. They may also suggest a promising, portable method of reducing disparities in CRC (and other) screening uptake between Hispanic and non-Hispanic individuals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our findings will determine whether an interactive multimedia computer program that is personally-tailored to cognitive mediators of screening behavior and deployed in primary care offices prior to previously scheduled visits can activate patients of various ethnicities to undergo colorectal cancer screening.

"Colorectal Cancer Education and Screening Program (CCESP)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is an essential component to the reduction of cancer health disparities. By using CBPR with community partners, we will increase colorectal cancer screening in underserved areas. In order to increase screening, we plan to provide education and screening for Arkansans in two underserved counties in the Arkansas Delta, specifically Northeast (Mississippi County) and Southeast (St. Francis County). Both education and provision of FOBT kits with reminders are proven means of increasing screening rates. A combination of the two has not been investigated to determine if screening rates can be further improved. Based on this, we hypothesize that a CBPR intervention providing education, awareness and FOBT screening tests in two underserved communities will Increase screening uptake rates above either treatment alone or control. We will test the hypothesis through the following Specific Aims:      Specific Aim 1: Implement standard, culturally tailored, and no treatment control co-developed interventions for colorectal cancer screening in collaboration with community partners to increase uptake of colorectal screening via FOBT screening techniques.   Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy of the standard and culturally tailored screening interventions (treatment arms) on uptake of colorectal cancer screening compared to the no treatment control arm and to each other   Specific Aim 3: Develop a dissemination plan of preliminary findings to distribute to community partners and research community as they become available.      Upon completion of the CBPR intervention, the collaboration of community partners and academicians will result in reduction of CRC disparities through education, increased knowledge, and screening. Our novel approach partners academia with the community in all aspects of a CBPR study evaluating a previously unexplored combination of education and provision of FOBT cards and reminders to increase colorectal cancer screening. Further, this study will allow us to better understand factors influencing cancer screening uptake. Future studies will include the full dissemination of findings of this study and further refinement of tailored screening interventions to address various cancer disparities.          ",Colorectal Cancer Education and Screening Program (CCESP),7493866,R24MD002805,"['Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Caring ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Progress Review Group ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Adoption ', ' Future ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' minority health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' Mississippi ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Arkansas ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Universities ', ' Awareness ', ' Upper arm ', ' Techniques ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' County ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R24,2008,514798,0.11527707826925021
"Understanding Racial and Ethnic Differences in Survival from Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancers are the third most common invasive cancers among men and women in the United States. Improvements in prevention, screening and treatment have resulted in decreasing case-fatality rates from colorectal cancer since the 1980s. Paradoxically, disparities in survival from this cancer especially between Blacks and Whites have widened over time. Although there is no consensus in existing literature, current evidence suggests that factors related to access to health care including socioeconomic differences contribute to these disparities. The goal of the proposed research program is to identify potentially modifiable causes of disparities in cancer survival with a long range goal of reducing or eliminating the disproportionate burden of colorectal cancer among certain patient populations. The specific aims for this project are to: 1) compare colorectal cancer survival rates by race/ethnicity over the period 1993 through 2004; 2) compare the distribution of tumor stage at diagnosis for colorectal cancer by race/ethnicity; 3) examine potential mediators of the relationship of survival and race/ethnicity among colorectal cancer patients; 4) examine the patterns of care of survivors of colorectal cancer; and 5) explore the effect of socioeconomic status on the relationship between race/ethnicity and survival among colorectal cancer patients. This project will be conducted on a large racially diverse cohort comprised of patients 20 years and older diagnosed with colorectal cancer (1993 to 2004) while enrolled in one of four integrated health care systems that are affiliated with the National Cancer Institute-funded Cancer Research Network. This research plan is part of a career development program aimed at providing the training and experience needed for Dr. Doubeni to become an independently funded clinician-investigator focusing on disparities in cancer survival. The objectives of the career development plan are to acquire knowledge and skills in: 1) cancer biology, epidemiology and treatment; 2) advanced research methods; 3) scientific writing; and 4) the translation of research into practice and policy. The career development program will be accomplished through mentoring and targeted advanced courses. The studies encompassed under the proposed research program will make important contributions to our understanding of racial/ethnic differences in cancer survival rates. The proposed project will lay the foundation for the candidate's long-term career goal of designing system-based interventions aimed at eliminating disparities in cancer care and survival, a major objective of HealthyPeople 2010.          ",Understanding Racial and Ethnic Differences in Survival from Colorectal Cancer,7495047,K01CA127118,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Tumor stage ', ' T-Stage ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Caring ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Range ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Research Network ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Foundations ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Chronic ', ' Invasive ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Survivors ', ' Incidence ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Program Development ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K01,2008,141539,0.1517192577714638
"A Population Based Policy Model for Colorectal Cancer In the first CISNET project we developed a population-based Monte Carlo simulation model that evaluates  national trends in the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). The HSPH-CISNET Model  incorporates age-, sex-, and race-specific trends in CRC risk factors, screening, and treatment, as well as  the effects of risk factors and screening on the underlying natural history of colorectal disease and the  effectiveness of treatment for patients with diagnosed CRC. The Model currently simulates the US  population aged 25 years and older from 1970 to 2020. We have used the Model to examine the relative  contribution of changes in risk factors, screening, and treatment to the overall population trends in CRC  incidence and mortality.  The purpose of this project is to use the HSPH-CISNET Model to evaluate the population impact of existing  cancer control strategies, as well as the impact of strategies on the horizon. Of particular importance is to  incorporate the associations between risk factors and screening trends, and to determine the potential  impact of disparities in CRC risk and mortality at a population level. Other aims will focus on evaluating the  population-level impact of specific risk factor trends, screening modalities, and treatment advancements.  To validate our modeling assumptions, we will use our model structure to simulate the population of  Norway, a country that does not have a CRC screening program, in an attempt to re-create their incidence  and mortality statistics. We will continue to collaborate with other modeling groups, as well as with the new  CRC Coordinating Center and the NCI to focus on questions that apply across all modeling groups. In  addition, we propose a concrete plan for making our model more accessible to outside collaborators. This  plan involves posting the model structure on a public website, sharing code with established outside  investigators, and providing the necessary model support.

"Improving the Process of Cancer Screening for Low Income Diverse Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. There has been a steady decrease in the mortality rates for this preventable disease over the last two decades due in part to an increase in screening. Screening has the potential to both reduce incidence and deaths for CRC. However, only about 29% of persons > 50 years from families with incomes below 200% of federal poverty level have ever had CRC screening compared to 36% among those in higher income brackets. Consequently, disadvantaged populations have a higher risk of death from CRC. Federally-qualified community health centers (CHC) provide comprehensive health care services to medically underserved persons regardless of ability to pay and are governed by a community board that includes consumers of services. Therefore, this provides a unique setting for an academic-community partnership for reducing cancer disparities. However, there is limited literature on the patterns of CRC screening in CHCs using the community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach. This pilot proposal will examine several key facets of CRC screening for disadvantaged patients at two CHCs in central Massachusetts using CBPR approach. This project will: 1) examine patterns of screening among adults served in the CHC setting; and 2) conduct qualitative interviews of healthcare providers involved in providing CRC screening services at the health centers and area hospitals in order to identify barriers and opportunities for improving rates of screening and follow-up of abnormal tests. In exploratory analyses, we will examine the follow-up of abnormal screening. The long-term goal is to reduce CRC disparities by producing meaningful improvements in cancer screening for disadvantaged persons through community-based efforts, a key goal of the parent Community Networks Program project grant for this project -MassCONECT. This proposal is part of the ongoing efforts of MassCONECT, and will be implemented using CBPR principles to: 1) build on strengths and resources within the community; 2) facilitate collaborative and equitable involvement of partners in all phases of the research; 3) promote a co-learning and empowering process; and 4) disseminate findings and knowledge gained to all partners using the CBPR partners as vehicles of dissemination. We expect that this new research experience will benefit the academic and community partners, and the populations served. This research proposal is also part of the career development of Dr. Doubeni, a minority junior clinician-investigator whose research interest is focused on eliminating CRC disparities. Dr. Doubeni will work with a dedicated mentor who will partner with the community partners and a team of experienced researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health in implementing this project.             ",Improving the Process of Cancer Screening for Low Income Diverse Populations,7459206,U01CA114644,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Provider ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Low income ', ' Endoscopy ', ' Program Research Project Grants ', ' Research Program Projects ', ' Program Project Grant ', ' P01 Program ', ' P01 Mechanism ', ' Qualifying ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Family ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Community Networks ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' federal poverty level ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,U01,2008,98385,0.2539384479745853
"Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening for Patients with Multiple Morbidities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Appalachian and rural underserved residents, in general, experience higher rates of multiple morbidities (MM) with fewer resources to prevent and manage disease. Some researchers have speculated that the well-documented cancer health disparities affecting Appalachians may be attributable to multiple morbidity management demands which may deprioritize essential and efficacious cancer screenings. In this pilot study, we examine whether and how multiple morbidities affect colorectal cancer screening rates. Our long-term goal is to turn this disadvantageous situation of competing time and resource pressure into an advantage by increasing cancer screening services during the more frequent medical interactions of those with multiple morbidities. Addressing the nearly three-quarters of middle aged and older adults with MM is essential due to skyrocketing rates of MM, higher rates of cancer mortality among those with MM, and competing demands of disease prevention and management. We aim to expand our limited understanding of the association between MM and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening through three research activities. First, to obtain rich insights into the factors and circumstances that affect patterns of CRC screening behavior among those with multiple morbidities, in-depth interviews will be conducted with 5 health care providers representing diverse practices in Appalachia and with 40 patients who have two or more chronic diseases. These interviews will provide locally grounded perspectives from the two most salient health decision makers, providers and patients. Second, to insure generalizability, we will assess the impact of factors germane to both MM and CRC screening behavior by conducting a stratified representative survey of Appalachians. Finally, after identifying factors, circumstances, and patterns that prevent CRC screening in the context of multiple morbidities, we will hold focus groups to validate our findings and discuss optimal direction for interventions. Ultimately, these findings will lead to the development of a community-based participatory intervention R01 that will capitalize on the relatively frequent medical care visits of those with multiple morbidities and ultimately will increase CRC screening, improve practice coordination, and decrease cancer-associated deaths. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US, the majority of the ever-growing middle aged and older population has multiple morbidities or several chronic diseases. Having multiple morbidities generally decreases the likelihood of receiving highly effective cancer prevention, like colorectal cancer screening. This project uses innovative methods to determine the reasons why those with multiple morbidities may be less likely to get colorectal cancer screening and will eventually develop a culturally consistent intervention for the underserved rural health disparities population of Appalachia to increase early detection of this deadly cancer.          ",Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening for Patients with Multiple Morbidities,7462898,R21CA129881,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Secondary Cancer Prevention ', ' Older Population ', ' Rural Health Underserved ', ' Underserved (Includes Rural Health) ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Rural ', ' Research Activity ', ' Mass Media ', ' mass information media ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' pressure ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Media Campaign ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' outreach ', ' Gender ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Rural Community ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communities ', ' underserved rural area ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Computers ', ' Consultations ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R21,2008,197775,0.25566996110245377
"RCT/Increase Colon Cancer Screening/Medicaid Managed Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Disparities persist in the colorectal cancer screening. There is need for practical, widely applicable interventions that could correct these disparities. Through previous work (R01-87776) we have developed a Prevention Care Management (PCM) intervention based on telephone support that increased colon cancer screening rates for low income women visiting community/migrant health centers in New York City almost two fold. The earlier project relied on research staff to recruit patients in community/migrant health center (C/MHC) waiting rooms and to provide the intervention, thus, limiting its transportability and sustainability.   This new project in response to PAR 04-036 will be based in Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MMCOs) which can provide sustainable, widely available infrastructures to support colon cancer screening especially for women who comprise a substantial majority of MMCO enrollees. Our first aim is to expand the scope of PCM to apply to MMCO-enrolled women who seldom visit primary care (outreach) while continuing to provide inreach to more frequent attenders. The second aim is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the expanded PCM intervention to assess its impact on colorectal cancer screening status of low-income women age 50-64 years and to describe the process of Prevention Care Management.    Several unique features of the project should be noted: the identification of women overdue for screening through MMCO claims data which is both practical to sustain and expands the reach of the project to include women who seldom visit primary care; the intervention will be delivered by established MMCO staff, not researchers appearing transiently but cannot sustain the intervention; outcomes will be assessed through MMCO claims data; and multiple representative MMCOs in New York City will be involved. Colon cancer screening will be promoted in the context of other indicated screening for breast and cervical cancer.     Aim three will explore the relationship of characteristics of the women (demographics), of the community/migrant health centers that serve them, and of the MMCOs in which they are enrolled to colorectal cancer screening status including the impact of the intervention. Cost of the intervention and its relationship to increased screening rates will be assessed. The intervention and evaluation are guided by Diffusion of Innovations.         ",RCT/Increase Colon Cancer Screening/Medicaid Managed Care,7424925,R01CA119014,"['Nomads ', ' Migrant ', ' New York City ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Breast ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Abbreviations ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Managed Care ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' demographics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Organizational Models ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Maintenance Organizations ', ' Prepaid Group Health Organizations ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Medicaid ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Preventive ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' ']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2008,493838,0.053106554801010106
"Training African American Peers as Patient Navigators for Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer health disparities related to race and ethnicity are among the most serious problems facing the US health care system. A recent Institute of Medicine report stated that such disparities are seen at every level of health care, from prevention to treatment and follow-up. This problem is acutely evident in the figures for colorectal cancer (CRC) among African Americans (AAs). According to the American Cancer Society, AAs have the highest CRC incidence and mortality of any ethnic/racial group. Indeed, CRC incidence and mortality are 15% and 43% higher among AAs than Whites, respectively. These disparities could be effectively reduced through greater AA participation in CRC screening and early detection. More importantly, due to the preponderance of CRC in AAs beyond the reach of the flexible sigmoidoscopy, increased adherence to colonoscopy among AAs will save lives. Although there is clear evidence that providing patients with someone to help them manage/navigate the health care system (i.e., patient navigation (PN)) is effective in helping them to complete cancer screening, very few hospitals provide PN for colonoscopy. The vast majority of hospitals in NYC are unable to provide PN for patients for whom colonoscopy is recommended, in large part because of the costs associated with professional-led PN. The proposed R-25E seeks to address this serious public health problem by investigating the success of training AAs who have undergone colonoscopy to serve as peer patient navigators to help others from their community complete CRC screening via colonoscopy.       The proposed training plan is supported by seven distinct lines of evidence: 1) research indicating a 76-90% reduction in CRC mortality through colonoscopy, 2) the success of PN in increasing participation in health promotion, 3) data from the NYC Department of Health showing underuse of PN for colonoscopy, 4) research demonstrating increased credibility of peers in providing health information, 5) research on volunteer-led health education interventions, 6) the cost savings we found in our preliminary research on peer led PN (PPN) for colonoscopy, and 7) our success in promoting cancer screening and preventative health care practices in AA communities of New York City through our collaboration with community leaders and church groups.       The overall goal of the proposed R-25E is to reduce CRC morbidity and mortality by increasing AA participation in colonoscopy in a cost effective way. This will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) The development and implementation of a training program for Peer Patient Navigation (PPN) to increase participation of AAs in colonoscopy; 2) The examination of the cost effectiveness of the PPN training program in completion of colonoscopy from the perspective of AAs for whom colonoscopy is recommended; and 3) The investigation of the relative cost effectiveness of the PPN training program from the perspective of hospitals.                   ",Training African American Peers as Patient Navigators for Colon Cancer Screening,7432276,R25CA132692,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Flexible sigmoidoscopy ', ' Fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' New York City ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Review Literature ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Role playing therapy ', ' role playing (psychodrama) ', ' Role Playing ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Supervision ', ' Tape Recording ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Training Programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' success ', ' peer ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Prevention ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Cost Savings ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' skill acquisition ', ' volunteer ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R25,2008,282083,0.063774931631833
"African American Multi-construct Survey of Cultural Attitudes Relevant to Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal of Healthy People 2010 is the elimination of health disparities. The Institute of Medicine and the National Cancer Institute have suggested cultural appropriateness of education materials and interventions as one strategy to reduce disparities. With few exceptions, rates of incidence and mortality are higher and 5-year survival lower among African American men and women than Whites for the leading causes of cancer death. Researchers have recognized that behavior, including those relevant to cancer prevention and control, occurs in a social context. Thus, an understanding of which social and cultural constructs are related to cancer screening and how seems appropriate. Measurement of behavioral and social science constructs requires that we be able to make distinctions among constructs, as well as dimensions of constructs with reasonable accuracy. A review of the current literature highlights concerns related to the measurement of cultural constructs, including strategies for operationalizing constructs, the variety of measures, psychometric properties of current measures, and difficulties studying constructs, and their relevant dimensions simultaneously rather than individually. This state of affairs limits our ability to determine the relative importance of cultural attitudes and norms for cancer prevention and control activities. To further knowledge in this area it is important that commonly accepted measures of the identified variables exist so that work from various studies can be easily compared. We propose to develop a measure of socio-cultural attitudes that taps the cultural values linked to cancer screening behaviors in the African American community. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer among African American men and women and has an authoritative set of screening guidelines; thus, we have selected colorectal cancer screening as our focus. The African American Multi-Construct Survey of Cultural Attitudes will provide an easily administered measure of cultural variables. We will use item response theory (IRT) to simultaneously development long, short and computer-adapted versions of an instrument capable of allowing quick, accurate assessment of multiple cultural constructs. At the end of this project, we will provide data on the computer adapted test of cultural constructs and their relevance to colorectal cancer screening behaviors among African Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will yield a core set of valid and reliable survey items that can improve the measurement of culture in cancer research, facilitate comparisons and minimize the redundancy of effort across research projects. This study also provides data on the relationship between cultural constructs and CRC cancer screening attitudes and behaviors. This information will be used in developing health education and promotion materials and interventions that more effectively target the African American community.          ",African American Multi-construct Survey of Cultural Attitudes Relevant to Cancer,7464510,R01CA122435,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' Health Promotion and Education ', ' Health Promotion and Training ', ' Health Promotion and Instruction ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cognitive ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Comprehension ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Guidelines ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Physical activity ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', ' Measurement ', ' Saints ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Perception ', ' Personnel Management ', ' tool ', ' Psychometrics ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Adopted ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' Participant ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' cultural values ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' behavioral health ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Computers ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,262283,0.1344895052397508
"Impact of Remote Familial Risk Assesment and Counseling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rate of adherence to regular colonoscopy screening among members of families at increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) is far below recommended levels. Persons who live in rural areas of the United States exhibit lower colorectal screening rates than their urban counterparts. Although the detection of familial predisposition to cancer begins with an accurate family medical history, data indicate that many patients do not receive adequate familial cancer risk assessment from their primary care providers. This suggests that familial risk is largely unrecognized which may lead to inadequate risk stratification, lack of risk notification, appropriate risk counseling, suboptimal cancer screening and preventable deaths. Because of geographic and system-level barriers, special efforts are needed to improve access to personalized risk communication and adherence to CRC screening in rural dwellers at increased risk for CRC. In the proposed study, we will evaluate a novel telephone-based, theory-guided personalized risk communication intervention that combines a familial CRC risk assessment and behavioral counseling with tailored messages. The key hypothesis guiding this study is that a more intensive personalized risk communication intervention will improve CS at a significantly higher rate than a low-intensity targeted print intervention. Our integrative study model specifies important theoretical mechanisms that can contribute to increased use of CS among persons at increased risk. We will enroll 712 rural adult men and women age 40 years and older who are considered at increased risk of familial CRC into this 2-group randomized trial. The primary aim of this study is to compare colonoscopy use among participants in the two groups. Secondary aims are to compare the two groups with regard to cognitive and emotional outcomes and explore the underlying mechanisms through which the interventions have an impact on colonoscopy behavior. Sociodemographic, clinical, behavioral and psychosocial measures will be collected from participants at baseline, 1 month, 6 months and 1 year. The study's findings will have both theoretical, as well as practical, significance. Our findings will help to influence the selection and dissemination of effective outreach approaches to improve CRC screening in populations at increased risk for the disease. These results have broad applicability to understanding responses to personalized risk communication interventions for other diseases as well. Findings will also broaden our understanding of the underlying theoretical mechanisms of how remote cancer risk communications lead to improvements in cancer screening among geographically underserved populations if such intervention effects are observed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Provision of personalized risk assessment and behavioral counseling services via the telephone is likely to ensure equitable access to cancer communications for rural and other underserved groups. Such interventions have the potential to translate into improved colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates among rural dwellers at increased risk for the disease by removing geographic and other barriers to accessing potentially life-saving cancer risk communications. Our study is highly responsive to national health communication and health disparity priorities, and will provide data that are needed to influence the development and dissemination of effective cancer communication interventions to high-risk individuals who reside in geographically underserved areas.          ",Impact of Remote Familial Risk Assesment and Counseling,7465643,R01CA125194,"['Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Hereditary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' familial cancer ', ' Hereditary Cancer ', ' Familiar Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Emotions ', ' End Point ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Health Communication ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Range ', ' Stratification ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Family ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Guidelines ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' uptake ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Family Cancer History ', ' Study models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Printing ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Utah ', ' Notification ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Services ', ' cancer risk ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' metropolitan ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' outreach ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' psychological distress ', ' Emotional ', ' Family member ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communication ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2008,627226,0.20689169331301302
"The Influence of Family and Cultural Identity on Informed Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence suggests more research is needed on how best to promote and facilitate informed decision making for colorectal cancer screening among African Americans. The long-term objective of this program of research is to decrease the colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, especially among African Americans through developing community-based interventions and methods to train healthcare providers to effectively promote colorectal cancer screening participation. The purpose of this descriptive, cross-sectional study is to examine the influence of cultural identity, family and colorectal cancer beliefs on an informed decision regarding colorectal cancer screening among African Americans. Recruited for this study will be African American men and women (N=128) 50 years and older who have or have not been screened for colorectal cancer. Informed decision making will be described using questionnaires. Participants will be recruited from the Detroit Community Network Partnership (CNP), a National Cancer Institute funded program to reduce cancer health disparities among African Americans, 50 years and older. Additionally, participants will be recruited from metropolitan Detroit barber and beauty shops and African American organizations. The conceptual model guiding this study is derived from the clinical and research experiences of the PI and the Preventative Health Model (PHM). Two specific aims will be addressed: 1) To examine the relationships among cultural identity, family influence, colorectal cancer beliefs and an informed decision regarding colorectal cancer screening in African Americans; 2) To determine if the relationships among cultural identity, family influence, colorectal cancer beliefs and an informed decision regarding colorectal cancer screening in African American men and women are different. This proposed study has been developed to fill critical gaps in nursing knowledge, cancer prevention and control research.

"Colorectal Cancer Screening in a Diverse Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am a primary care physician and researcher, who is committed to understanding and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in cancer.  If granted this award, I will build upon my Master's in Public Health degree and my prior research experience to advance my knowledge and skills through coursework, mentored research, apprentice-style learning and semi-structured training.  The University of Texas Medical Branch is especially committed to improving the health of the diverse and underserved local populations we serve, through high quality patient care and ongoing research and is very supportive of my career development plan.  I have integrated the coursework and research activities so that I can achieve my objectives.  The long-term objective of the proposed research is to explain and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in colorectal cancer disease burden.  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the USA, accounting for ten percent of all cancer deaths.  As with other cancers, African Americans carry an unequal burden from this disease, they have the highest incidence and mortality of all racial/ethnic groups.  There is now good evidence that screening for colorectal cancer reduces mortality from this disease and currently five screening options are recommended.  However, national self-reported screening data suggests that screening levels are poor, especially in minority groups.  The higher mortality in African Americans is thought to be due in part to their higher incidence and in part due to their lower screening rates.  The research in this plan will address this underutilization of screening about which many unanswered questions remain: there is uncertainty about the accuracy of self-reported screening data, especially in minority patients, and there remains a lack of understanding as to the mechanisms through which race/ethnicity affects screening behavior both for African Americans and Hispanics.  In order to address these issues, we plan a series of related aims in a population of African American, Hispanic and Non-Hispanic white patients.  We propose a cross-sectional study utilizing a survey instrument that will be developed especially for use in our racial/ethnically diverse population.  The purpose of the first aim of our study is to determine the prevalence of age and risk appropriate screening in our patient population.  The second aim will determine the accuracy of self-reported information by comparing patient responses to medical record information.  The third aim will examine the mechanisms through which a person's race/ethnicity determines their colorectal cancer screening behavior; we will examine how patient factors, health care system factors and patients' interactions with their environment correlate with self-reported screening behavior.  The fourth aim will involve describing patient preferences for the array of CRC screening tests and systematically evaluating other influences on CRC screening such as health care delivery systems and physician factors and finally integrating all this information to design an intervention to increase CRC screening in all groups and to submit it for an R01 application prior to the end of the award.               ",Colorectal Cancer Screening in a Diverse Population,7454332,K07CA107052,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Commit ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Affect ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Age ', ' career ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Incidence ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Research Activity ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentors ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' instrument ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Universities ', ' Clinic ', ' Award ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Accounting ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' billing data ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K07,2008,128709,0.24871448739205412
"Colon cancer disparity elimination: a faith-based participatory partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elimination of the glaring colorectal cancer-related disparities in African Americans (AA) IS POSSIBLE. In this community based participatory research project (CPBR), we address both the SUPPLY and DEMAND components of the solution. Employing the community consultants and physicians successfully trained in Phase I, we have an adequate provider base to satisfy the increased demand resulting from this faith oriented barrier-free colonoscopy screening initiative. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is predominately preventable through screening for and removal of precancerous polyps. Unfortunately every year over 50,000 Americans of all races die unnecessarily. Multiple barriers result in an unacceptable disparity in both incidence and mortality for the AA, with the result that the death rate for AA males with advanced CRC cancer is double that for white males. The discovery of the evolution of CRC from benign polyps gives physicians ample time to remove the offending tissue prior to the development of cancers. The importance for screening in the AA population is accentuated by the documented shorter interval from the appearance of a polyp until its malignant transformation. We also know that colonoscopy is the ""gold standard."" The current capacity for performing colonoscopy is far below what is needed to screen the at-risk population as recent data reveals that only one-third of the appropriate population is compliant. In addition to capacity issues, many barriers to screening are patient related characteristics such as knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, cultural and ethnic issues, acceptability of screening method(s), ability to pay, and other socioeconomic and environmental issues (i.e. transportation, stigma, social support, etc.). Although over 80% of colonoscopies are provided by gastroenterologists, less than 4% in training are AA, fostering a growing gap in culturally competent colonoscopy providers. Using a triangulated theoretical framework including the Health Belief Model, the Social Cognitive Theory and the RE-AIM Evaluation model, we will further demonstrate a successful solution to addressing both SUPPLY (capacity for colorectal screening) and DEMAND (targeted patient access to and utilization of colorectal screening). The Phase I study confirmed that compliance can be achieved comparable to that for breast cancer screening (75%). The astounding high-rate of neoplasia (4%) emphasizes the critical importance of this endeavor.           ",Colon cancer disparity elimination: a faith-based participatory partnership,7494220,R24MD002812,"['Provider ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Endoscopy ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Specialized Center ', ' P50 Program ', ' P50 Mechanism ', ' Monitor ', ' Rate ', ' Evolution ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Gastroenterology ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Incidence ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Americas ', ' male ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Gastroenterologist ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' neoplasia ', ' Glare ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Polyps ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stigmata ', ' Solutions ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' South Carolina ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transportation ', ' Attitude ', ' Caucasians ', ' Hour ', ' Week ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Belief ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' outreach ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Appearance ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' County ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' outreach program ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' phase I trial ', ' phase I protocol ', ' phase 1 trial ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Colorectal Polyp ', ' large intestine polyp ', ' large bowel polyp ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' volunteer ', ' community based participatory research ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' ']",NIMHD,EAU CLAIRE COOPERATIVE HEALTH CENTER,R24,2008,479076,0.07109534291218422
"Modeling Effective Health Policies for Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Despite recent declines in both incidence and mortality, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States. The present project aims to provide guidance on how to further reduce the burden of this disease, considering interventions based on primary prevention, screening, and treatment improvement. To this end, a wide range of issues is addressed in order to provide an overview of relative effects of alternative intervention policies. This study is a collaboration between Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Erasmus University (Erasmus MC) in Rotterdam.      We use a population based microsimulation model (MISCAN-Colon) to assess the effect of individual interventions and combinations on the burden of CRC. MISCAN was originally developed by Erasmus MC to assess screening interventions and has been extended in our current project to incorporate changes in risk factors, chemoprevention and treatment efficacy. This model simulates the full dynamic US population which makes it particularly suitable for assessment of effects of interventions on a population level, including effects on CRC incidence and mortality, and also on quality of life, demands for medical capacity and economic burden over time.       In order to make reliable projections for the future, it is necessary to understand to what extent the decline in CRC incidence and mortality is attributable to changes in exposures to ""lifestyle"" factors, changes in use of screening, changes in treatment, or combinations of these factors. Therefore, the specific aims are to use the MISCAN microsimulation model to 1.) Estimate the absolute and relative contribution of changing lifestyle factors, screening, and improved therapy on the observed trends in CRC incidence and mortality in the United States 1975-2002; and then to explore future scenarios to 2.) Evaluate the potential impact of current and newly developing technologies on lifestyle interventions, chemoprevention, screening, and treatment improvement on future trends in CRC incidence and mortality in the US and 3.) Translate the impact of implementation of interventions found to be effective in reducing incidence and mortality under Aim 2, into the burden of colorectal cancer also with respect to life years gained, quality of life, required medical capacity and economic burden. Aims 2 and 3 will also consider targeted intervention for individuals with increased risk due to familial predisposition.      The results from these analyses can be used to inform decisions of directing medical and public health resources to the most effective interventions in the appropriate risk groups.

"An Interactive Colorectal Cancer Screening Promotion Intervention for Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this study is to develop an effective education intervention that increases screening adherence to colorectal cancer screening guidelines and reduces the rates of late-stage detection and preventable mortality among medically underserved Latinos. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) develop culturally and linguistically appropriate colorectal cancer screening and risk reduction information designed for low- income, low literacy Latinos, (2) develop digital multimedia touchscreen kiosks to deliver interactive colorectal cancer screening and risk reduction information to low-income, low literacy Latinos, (3) evaluate the efficacy of an interactive, multimedia kiosk intervention to increase knowledge about colorectal cancer risk and promote screening and other risk reduction behaviors among low-income, low literacy Latinos, and (4) evaluate the acceptance of the interactive, multimedia kiosk by clinical providers and low-income, low literacy Latinos receiving the intervention. The HHS Initiative to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities calls attention to the gaps in access to preventive health services for low-income, medically underserved individuals. This study to develop and evaluate a colorectal cancer screening promotion intervention for medically underserved Latinos responds to the National Cancer Institute's program on Interactive Media Technologies in Cancer Prevention, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control to promote the use of innovative media technology and/or communication approaches in cancer prevention and control applications used in medical and community settings. The intervention study employs a randomized controlled design. Study participants will be given a pretest and randomly assigned to either an intervention or control condition in equal numbers. The intervention group will be exposed to an interactive, multimedia colorectal cancer education intervention while the control group will receive standard care, which means they will not receive any CRC education materials. Six-months from baseline, a post-test will be administered to both intervention and control groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study addresses the health disparity of preventable colorectal cancer mortality among Latinos due to low screening rates and correspondingly high rates of late-stage detection. If the efficacy of this education intervention to improve screening adherence is demonstrated in this study, interactive kiosks offer the means for deployment of an intervention on a national scale to significantly impact colorectal cancer screening rates and thereby reduce mortality.              Project Narrative The study addresses the health disparity of preventable colorectal cancer mortality among Latinos due to low screening rates and correspondingly high rates of late-stage detection.

"Molecular Genetics of Colorectal Cancer Progression in a Diverse Patient Cohort    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of new cancer cases and cancer deaths in the United States. A pronounced disparity exists between African American and Caucasian American patients, with African Americans displaying both increased incidence and mortality rates. Although many factors play a role in this health disparity, several findings also suggest a role for tumor biology and genetics. MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 are proteins expressed by mismatch repair genes that are responsible for repairing nucleotide mispairs and small insertions or deletions caused by the DNA replication machinery. Prior studies have revealed that African Americans display a younger age at presentation, a higher incidence of proximal- located tumors and a higher prevalence of the microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, a phenotype commonly observed in Lynch Syndrome patients (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) and associated with loss of function of the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins. Based upon these findings, I hypothesize that increased alteration of mismatch repair genes in African American patients may account for the higher incidence of MSI-H tumors and, further, that both the frequency and spectrum of mismatch repair gene alterations may be distinct in African American patients. To evaluate this hypothesis, Brooke Sylvester proposes the following aims: aim 1) to analyze a cohort of colorectal cancer patients to determine if demographic factors correlate with tumor pathology, microsatellite instability status and survival, using immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue microarrays and microsatellite instability testing; aim 2) to compare the mutation spectrum and mutation or promoter hypermethylation frequency of mismatch repair genes in our patient population with those previously reported in other populations, using publicly available datasets; aim 3) to determine whether mismatch repair proteins play a role in the DNA damage-induced apoptotic response, utilizing RNA interference techniques to silence the expression of mismatch repair genes. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the molecular mechanisms leading to the distinct phenotype observed in African American colorectal cancer patients and how this may affect colorectal cancer progression. If this phenomenon plays a role in the increased incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer in African American patients, then this study will be relevant in identifying therapies that will reduce or eliminate the unequal burden of cancer in our society.             ",Molecular Genetics of Colorectal Cancer Progression in a Diverse Patient Cohort,7546828,F31CA136237,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencings ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencings ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencings ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Mismatch Repair ', ' Post-Replication Mismatch Repair ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' protein expression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Defect ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Hypermethylation ', ' Mutation Spectra ', ' Apoptotic ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Tumor Pathology ', ' Rate ', ' Molecular ', ' Exhibits ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' Goals ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Incidence ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Cytotoxic agent ', ' Cytotoxic drug ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Caucasians ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA biosynthesis ', ' DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA Replication ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Chicago ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' MSH2 gene ', ' MSH2 ', ' FCC1 ', ' COCA1 ', ' MLH1 gene ', ' hMLH1 ', ' MLH1 ', ' MGC5172 ', ' FCC2 ', ' COCA2 ', ' PMS2 gene ', ' PMSL2 ', ' PMS2 ', ' H_DJ0042M02.9 ', ' HNPCC4 ', ' DNA Mismatch Repair Gene Homologue ', ' MSH6 gene ', ' MSH6 ', ' HNPCC5 ', ' Microsatellite Instability ', ' Accounting ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ', ' Lynch Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, hPMS2) ', ' Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Defective Mismatch Repair Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Colorectal Endometrial Cancer Syndrome ', ' Familial Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Familial Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, hPMS2) ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' Population ', ' loss of function ', ' tumor ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2008,32339,0.09898273435373595
"Patient Navigation for CRC Screening with Low-Income Minorities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal Cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates are highest in African Americans (AA's) compared with all other ethnic groups. One factor that may contribute to this trend is the lower rate of participation in CRC screening among AAs, which is critical to the prevention and early detection of CRC. Recent data indicate that the removal of precancerous polyps (via colonoscopy) decreases CRC incidence by 75-90 percent. Despite the implementation of national policy changes to increase CRC screening (through Medicaid/Medicare reimbursement for CRC screening and easier ""open"" access to colonoscopy) adherence remains alarmingly low. Our preliminary data show that, even after implementation of standard patient navigation (SPN) (i.e., assisting patients with making/keeping their appointments), only 40 percent of low-income minorities followed-through on their physician recommendation. Guided by Cognitive-Behavioral Social Learning Theory as a conceptual framework and cultural targeting as an intervention strategy, the proposed randomized clinical trial will investigate integrating within SPN a targeted discussion of intrapersonal and cultural barriers to colonoscopy (i.e., fear, lack of knowledge, medical mistrust, fatalism and fear) prevalent with low-income AAs. Based on research on source credibility and reference group-based social identity theory, we will also explore navigator status as a peer on the impact of culturally targeted PN. Thus, we will compare three PN strategies: SPN carried out by a professional navigator, Culturally Targeted PN carried out by a professional (CTPN-Pro) and Culturally Targeted PN carried out by a peer who has undergone colonoscopy (CTPN-Peer). Specific Aims: Aim 1: Compare the efficacy of SPN, CTPN-Pro, and CTPN-Peer on adherence to colonoscopy CRC screening in average risk, low-income AAs who have a primary care physician referral for colonoscopy. Aim 2: Explore potential mechanisms (i.e., mediators) underlying the beneficial effects of CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer and to examine for whom the CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer are most effective (i.e., moderators). Aim 3: Compare the cost effectiveness of CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer. Cost effectiveness will be examined in terms of direct clinical costs of screening (i.e., savings associated with more efficient use of personnel, space, and equipment) and patient costs (i.e., costs of CRC treatment and the opportunity costs to the patient per life-year saved). Results from the proposed work will facilitate the broad dissemination of PN to reduce ethnic and racial health disparities in CRC incidence mortality and will advance our understanding of PN.           ",Patient Navigation for CRC Screening with Low-Income Minorities,7489302,R01CA120658,"['racial/ethnic ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Equipment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Flexible sigmoidoscopy ', ' Fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Guidelines ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Incidence ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Policies ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Appointment ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Colon, Rectum ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Polypectomy ', ' PLYPCMY ', ' American ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' social ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' opportunity cost ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' coping ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2008,607040,0.2507459494330408
"CBPR Strategies to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Ohio Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): a disproportionate burden of CRC incidence and mortality, mainly due to lower utilization of recommended CRC screening tests. The Appalachian region of Ohio suffers from this burden of disease in addition to higher poverty, lower employment, and lower educational levels. To address this cancer health disparity, our health disparities research team at The Ohio State University (OSU) in partnership with four Appalachia-based community coalitions have used community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods to design and pilot test two interventions intended to increase CRC screening rates in one Appalachian county (Phase 1).  The goal of this application is to test these CRC screening interventions in 12 Ohio Appalachian counties (Phase 2) in preparation for a full-scale dissemination trial (Phase 3) in 6 additional Appalachian states within the Appalachia Community Cancer Network (ACCN).      The specific aims of this Phase 2 proposal are to: 1) utilize CBPR methods to refine specific county-level media campaigns and clinic-based messages about CRC screening (entitled ""Get Behind Your Health!"") or an attention control message (a healthy eating campaign entitled ""PEACHES"") in 12 Ohio Appalachia counties; 2) implement and test, using a group-randomized design, a staggered county-wide intervention program that compares county-specific media campaigns featuring local CRC survivors, clinic-specific charter reminder systems, and a combination of the two strategies in 6 randomly selected intervention counties to the same campaign strategies in 6 randomly selected attention control counties using county specific healthy eating campaigns featuring local farmers and educational material placed in clinics; 3) utilize process (convenience samples of county residents) and outcome evaluation (4 independent cross-sectional surveys of residents of each county) strategies to assess the efficacy of each strategy on improving CRC screening rates; and 4) utilize the results, to plan the dissemination of the intervention into 36 Appalachian counties in 6 additional states of the ACCN in a subsequent Phase 3 study.      All specific aims will be carried out using CBPR principles, in full partnership with these four Ohio Appalachian community-based cancer coalitions, and will be guided by an underlying theoretical framework of the Transtheoretical Model, in conjunction with three behavioral theories relevant to behavior change (Social Cognitive Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action, and Attitude Accessibility Theory).  The results of this study, thus, will have immediate impact in these Appalachian counties, as the community will be able to institutionalize successful strategies into existing county-wide health campaigns.          ",CBPR Strategies to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Ohio Appalachia,7676517,R24MD002785,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Employment ', ' Address ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Preparation ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Phase ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Incidence ', ' Evaluation ', ' farmer ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Phase III Clinical Trials ', ' phase III trial ', ' phase III protocol ', ' phase 3 trial ', ' Phase 3 Clinical Trials ', ' Ohio ', ' Poverty ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' intervention program ', ' Media Campaign ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Modality ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' County ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' dissemination trial ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' ']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2008,223148,0.18648440451113946
"Overcoming Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening in Appalachia: A Pilot Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Purpose: The overall goal of this study is to develop methods and gather preliminary data for a future R01 study that will test the efficacy of fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening and telephone barriers counseling in rural Appalachia.    Design: A prospective, clinic-based, participatory design will be used to determine acceptability of a provider-recommended, take-home FIT kit and screening adherence with and without follow-up telephone barriers counseling. The telephone barriers counseling is based upon the Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP) theoretical model.    Methods: A purposive sample of patients age 50 and older, at average CRC risk, and currently non- adherent for CRC screening (n=300) attending a regularly-scheduled, office visit in two rural, Appalachian primary care clinics will be recruited and complete the baseline questionnaire in the clinic waiting room. During the patient's exam/consultation the provider will recommend CRC screening and offer a take-home, FIT screening kit and educational brochure on CRC with a request for the completed test to be mailed to a central lab for processing within one week. Non-compliers will receive a single telephone barriers counseling session to address barriers reported at baseline and during the counseling session. Those who remain non- adherent following barriers counseling will receive a second, brief telephone assessment to determine reasons for non-compliance and encourage completion of screening.    Analysis: Primary outcomes are patient acceptability of the intervention and screening adherence rates with and without barriers counseling. Secondary outcomes are CRC-related knowledge and barriers to screening assessed at baseline and 3-months follow-up. Screening outcomes will be evaluated by examining percentages of completed screening following provider recommendation of screening and following barriers counseling, compared to those in the literature. A process evaluation will assess overall feasibility of the intervention.    Dissemination: Findings will be disseminated through the participating clinics and their local cancer coalitions, scientific meetings, and a manuscript submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. Findings will also be used as a foundation for the development of future studies and applications for extramural research support.    Contributions: This research will provide an important contribution to the understanding of patient barriers to CRC screening, the primary care physician's role in increasing CRC screening, and the discovery of effective cancer control methods that ultimately may help reduce the cancer burden in Appalachia.             ",Overcoming Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening in Appalachia: A Pilot Study,7459239,U01CA114622,"['Personal

"Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Americans Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, affecting both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups. The majority of these deaths could be prevented since CRC, when discovered early, is highly treatable and screening that leads to removal of adenomatous polyps decreases CRC incidence by 75% to 90%. Nationally, in 2002, only 50% of adults aged 50 or older reported having had any screening test in the recommended intervals. Both CRC incidence and mortality rates are higher among African Americans than any other racial group. These health disparities are due, in part, to delay in diagnosis resulting in advanced stage disease at presentation. Lower rates of CRC screening participation among African Americans contribute to this burden. Interactive computer-based interventions effectively promote health behavior change by delivering individualized, or tailored, health information and counseling. In pilot testing, a tailored, interactive computer intervention designed to promote CRC screening among African Americans resulted in increased CRC knowledge and higher rates of fecal occult blood testing. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a tailored, interactive computer intervention to promote CRC screening by comparing it to, and combining it with, a physician recommendation, which has been found to be a significant predictor of CRC screening. A sample of 1248 African American men and women who are being seen in two Midwestern primary care networks and who are non-adherent to colon cancer screening guidelines will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) a CRC screening brochure; 2) an interactive computer intervention; or 3) the interactive computer intervention plus the brochure. Both process and outcome variables will be examined. Rates of adherence to fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are primary outcomes examined at 6 and 15 months. Logistic regression models will be used to test intervention effects separately for two outcomes, fecal occult blood testing (initial and repeat) and endoscopic screening, while adjusting for potentially confounding covariates. Mediators and moderators of intervention effects and changes in health beliefs related to the interventions also will be determined.         ",Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Americans,7409537,R01CA115983,"['Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Computers ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Progress Review Group ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Adoption ', ' Guidelines ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' minority health ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Adenomatous Polyps ', ' polypoid adenoma ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' uptake ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Staging ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Sigmoidoscopy ', ' Proctosigmoidoscopy ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Week ', ' Clinic ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' cancer risk ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Genus Cola ', ' Cola ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Today ', ' Gender ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Documentation ', ' Colon ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' ']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2008,499736,0.27224856090747285
"Cancer Control Dissemination to Asian Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of our proposal is to disseminate an evidence-based intervention designed for one Asian ethnic population to a different Asian ethnic population with overlapping cultural and health beliefs. In collaboration with International Community Health Services (ICHS), a community agency serving many Asian ethnic groups, we have three specific objectives for the proposed research:  Replicate an effective colorectal cancer (CRC) screening intervention for Vietnamese Americans that was originally designed for Chinese Americans.  Evaluate the dissemination of this replicated intervention through a quasi-experimental study.  Collect and examine dissemination process data. Based on principles from Diffusion of Innovation Theory, we proposed to replicate an intervention with a 42% effect size. The replicated intervention will consist of a Vietnamese language video and bilingual pamphlet. We will translate and dub into Vietnamese our award-winning Chinese-language video, ""Being a Winner in Life: How to Prevent Colorectal Cancer."" The Chinese/English pamphlet will also be translated into Vietnamese. To provide feedback on the translated video script and pamphlet, we will convene 4 focus groups with Vietnamese men and women. Subsequently, we will introduce these materials to the intervention clinic staff at in-service training presentations and specifically recommend that intervention clinic medical assistants distribute the intervention materials. To evaluate the dissemination of this replicated intervention, our quantitative analysis will examine the Reach and Effectiveness based on the RE-AIM framework through a quasi-experimental study over an 18-month period. There are 919 and 802 age-eligible Vietnamese patients at the intervention and control clinic respectively. To determine the Effectiveness of the intervention, the primary outcome will be changes in CRC screening adherence rates at the intervention and control clinics. We will randomly select 25% of the patients from each clinic for pre- and post-intervention chart audits and use the Generalized Estimating Equation to model CRC screening adherence at the two clinics at pre- and post-intervention. Process evaluation will examine Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance at the intervention clinic. We will collect qualitative data from 10 key informant interviews with ICHS management personnel and intervention clinic staff. In addition, 3 focus groups with medical assistants, the intervention agents, anof two focus groups with Vietnamese patients at the intervention clinic will also be completed.           ",Cancer Control Dissemination to Asian Americans,7502701,R01CA124397,"['innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' computerized data processing ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' International ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Feedback ', ' Adoption ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medical ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Japan ', ' Korea ', ' Language ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', ' Funding ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Personnel Management ', ' Philosophy ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Translating ', ' Vietnam ', ' Viet Nam ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' size ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Reporting ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' Chinese American ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Services ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2008,285689,0.14292404996716015
"Understanding Racial and Ethnic Differences in Survival from Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancers are the third most common invasive cancers among men and women in the United States. Improvements in prevention, screening and treatment have resulted in decreasing case-fatality rates from colorectal cancer since the 1980s. Paradoxically, disparities in survival from this cancer especially between Blacks and Whites have widened over time. Although there is no consensus in existing literature, current evidence suggests that factors related to access to health care including socioeconomic differences contribute to these disparities. The goal of the proposed research program is to identify potentially modifiable causes of disparities in cancer survival with a long range goal of reducing or eliminating the disproportionate burden of colorectal cancer among certain patient populations. The specific aims for this project are to: 1) compare colorectal cancer survival rates by race/ethnicity over the period 1993 through 2004; 2) compare the distribution of tumor stage at diagnosis for colorectal cancer by race/ethnicity; 3) examine potential mediators of the relationship of survival and race/ethnicity among colorectal cancer patients; 4) examine the patterns of care of survivors of colorectal cancer; and 5) explore the effect of socioeconomic status on the relationship between race/ethnicity and survival among colorectal cancer patients. This project will be conducted on a large racially diverse cohort comprised of patients 20 years and older diagnosed with colorectal cancer (1993 to 2004) while enrolled in one of four integrated health care systems that are affiliated with the National Cancer Institute-funded Cancer Research Network. This research plan is part of a career development program aimed at providing the training and experience needed for Dr. Doubeni to become an independently funded clinician-investigator focusing on disparities in cancer survival. The objectives of the career development plan are to acquire knowledge and skills in: 1) cancer biology, epidemiology and treatment; 2) advanced research methods; 3) scientific writing; and 4) the translation of research into practice and policy. The career development program will be accomplished through mentoring and targeted advanced courses. The studies encompassed under the proposed research program will make important contributions to our understanding of racial/ethnic differences in cancer survival rates. The proposed project will lay the foundation for the candidate's long-term career goal of designing system-based interventions aimed at eliminating disparities in cancer care and survival, a major objective of HealthyPeople 2010.

"African American Multi-construct Survey of Cultural Attitudes Relevant to Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal of Healthy People 2010 is the elimination of health disparities. The Institute of Medicine and the National Cancer Institute have suggested cultural appropriateness of education materials and interventions as one strategy to reduce disparities. With few exceptions, rates of incidence and mortality are higher and 5-year survival lower among African American men and women than Whites for the leading causes of cancer death. Researchers have recognized that behavior, including those relevant to cancer prevention and control, occurs in a social context. Thus, an understanding of which social and cultural constructs are related to cancer screening and how seems appropriate. Measurement of behavioral and social science constructs requires that we be able to make distinctions among constructs, as well as dimensions of constructs with reasonable accuracy. A review of the current literature highlights concerns related to the measurement of cultural constructs, including strategies for operationalizing constructs, the variety of measures, psychometric properties of current measures, and difficulties studying constructs, and their relevant dimensions simultaneously rather than individually. This state of affairs limits our ability to determine the relative importance of cultural attitudes and norms for cancer prevention and control activities. To further knowledge in this area it is important that commonly accepted measures of the identified variables exist so that work from various studies can be easily compared. We propose to develop a measure of socio-cultural attitudes that taps the cultural values linked to cancer screening behaviors in the African American community. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer among African American men and women and has an authoritative set of screening guidelines; thus, we have selected colorectal cancer screening as our focus. The African American Multi-Construct Survey of Cultural Attitudes will provide an easily administered measure of cultural variables. We will use item response theory (IRT) to simultaneously development long, short and computer-adapted versions of an instrument capable of allowing quick, accurate assessment of multiple cultural constructs. At the end of this project, we will provide data on the computer adapted test of cultural constructs and their relevance to colorectal cancer screening behaviors among African Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will yield a core set of valid and reliable survey items that can improve the measurement of culture in cancer research, facilitate comparisons and minimize the redundancy of effort across research projects.

"Modeling Effective Health Policies for Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Despite recent declines in both incidence and mortality, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States. The present project aims to provide guidance on how to further reduce the burden of this disease, considering interventions based on primary prevention, screening, and treatment improvement. To this end, a wide range of issues is addressed in order to provide an overview of relative effects of alternative intervention policies. This study is a collaboration between Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Erasmus University (Erasmus MC) in Rotterdam.      We use a population based microsimulation model (MISCAN-Colon) to assess the effect of individual interventions and combinations on the burden of CRC. MISCAN was originally developed by Erasmus MC to assess screening interventions and has been extended in our current project to incorporate changes in risk factors, chemoprevention and treatment efficacy. This model simulates the full dynamic US population which makes it particularly suitable for assessment of effects of interventions on a population level, including effects on CRC incidence and mortality, and also on quality of life, demands for medical capacity and economic burden over time.       In order to make reliable projections for the future, it is necessary to understand to what extent the decline in CRC incidence and mortality is attributable to changes in exposures to ""lifestyle"" factors, changes in use of screening, changes in treatment, or combinations of these factors. Therefore, the specific aims are to use the MISCAN microsimulation model to 1.) Estimate the absolute and relative contribution of changing lifestyle factors, screening, and improved therapy on the observed trends in CRC incidence and mortality in the United States 1975-2002; and then to explore future scenarios to 2.) Evaluate the potential impact of current and newly developing technologies on lifestyle interventions, chemoprevention, screening, and treatment improvement on future trends in CRC incidence and mortality in the US and 3.) Translate the impact of implementation of interventions found to be effective in reducing incidence and mortality under Aim 2, into the burden of colorectal cancer also with respect to life years gained, quality of life, required medical capacity and economic burden. Aims 2 and 3 will also consider targeted intervention for individuals with increased risk due to familial predisposition.      The results from these analyses can be used to inform decisions of directing medical and public health resources to the most effective interventions in the appropriate risk groups. We will collaborate with NCI and other CISNET investigators in conducting this work.         ",Modeling Effective Health Policies for Colorectal Cancer,7681160,U01CA097426,"['Chemoprevention ', ' Simulate ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Exposure to ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Life ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' meetings ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Genus Cola ', ' Cola ', ' Modality ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Accounting ', ' years of life lost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Population ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' treatment strategy ', ' intervention effect ', ' palliative chemotherapy ', ' surveillance strategy ', ' Financial cost ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' MSKCC ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' CISNET ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' trend ', ' Modification ', ' Adjuvant ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Flexible sigmoidoscopy ', ' Fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' insight ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Collaborations ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2009,306897,0.21158057349085363
"Understanding Mechanisms of Ethnic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a rich literature documenting racial and ethnic disparities in the trajectory of cancer care and outcomes. Through analyses of tumor registry and Medicare data, the Principal Investigator and co-investigators have begun to uncover explanatory mechanisms or pathways underlying such disparities. We and others have identified disparities in survival after a diagnosis of cancer, much of which can be explained by delays in diagnosis leading to more advanced stage at diagnosis, and also by less than adequate treatment. There has also been considerable research on patient-level, physician level, and system- level factors that contribute to disparities in the trajectory of care. In this application we will conduct explanatory analyses with Medicare claims data to identify the mechanisms underlying racial disparities in stage of diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC), with a focus on the role of CRC screening among older adults. We will also develop methods to measure the performance of individual primary care physicians in providing CRC screening for patients. Of particular interest is how individual physicians' performance contributes to racial disparities in screening use. Aim 1: Determine the rate of screening for colorectal cancer in black and white men and women 65- 75 enrolled in fee for service Medicare in Michigan, New Jersey and Texas from 2001 through 2007. Aim 2: Determine the effect of other subject level (predisposing, enabling, and need) and environment level characteristics of CRC screening and determine the effect of continuity of care with a primary care physician (PCP) on receipt of CRC screening. Aim 3: Describe the variation among PCPs in use of CRC screening and determine how much of the race disparity in CRC screening is explained by PCP as opposed to patient characteristics. Aim 4: Examine the effects of provider characteristics (years in practice, age, volume of cases, primary specialty board certification, affiliation with academic medical centers, etc.) and medical system characteristics (PCPs per capita, gastroenterologists per capita) on the likelihood of CRC screening and also stratified by subjects' race. There are a number of options available to Medicare to promote health and reduce health disparities among its beneficiaries. The results of the mechanistic analyses in this application will allow for the design of interventions targeting the specific points in the trajectory of care that contribute to ethnic disparities in CRC screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the U.S., colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most frequently diagnosed but second leading cause of death among cancers. We will study Medicare data to understand better the reasons for racial disparities in CRC screening rates. With this information, Medicare will be able to design and implement interventions to promote health and reduce health disparities among its beneficiaries.          ",Understanding Mechanisms of Ethnic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Screening,7659567,R01CA134275,"['Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Board Certification ', ' Data ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' beneficiary ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' tumor registry ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Gastroenterologist ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New Jersey ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Native Americans ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Staging ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' programs ', ' Specialty Boards ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Modality ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' social ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R01,2009,313325,0.27898437644292134
"Impact of Remote Familial Risk Assesment and Counseling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rate of adherence to regular colonoscopy screening among members of families at increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) is far below recommended levels. Persons who live in rural areas of the United States exhibit lower colorectal screening rates than their urban counterparts. Although the detection of familial predisposition to cancer begins with an accurate family medical history, data indicate that many patients do not receive adequate familial cancer risk assessment from their primary care providers. This suggests that familial risk is largely unrecognized which may lead to inadequate risk stratification, lack of risk notification, appropriate risk counseling, suboptimal cancer screening and preventable deaths. Because of geographic and system-level barriers, special efforts are needed to improve access to personalized risk communication and adherence to CRC screening in rural dwellers at increased risk for CRC. In the proposed study, we will evaluate a novel telephone-based, theory-guided personalized risk communication intervention that combines a familial CRC risk assessment and behavioral counseling with tailored messages. The key hypothesis guiding this study is that a more intensive personalized risk communication intervention will improve CS at a significantly higher rate than a low-intensity targeted print intervention. Our integrative study model specifies important theoretical mechanisms that can contribute to increased use of CS among persons at increased risk. We will enroll 712 rural adult men and women age 40 years and older who are considered at increased risk of familial CRC into this 2-group randomized trial. The primary aim of this study is to compare colonoscopy use among participants in the two groups. Secondary aims are to compare the two groups with regard to cognitive and emotional outcomes and explore the underlying mechanisms through which the interventions have an impact on colonoscopy behavior. Sociodemographic, clinical, behavioral and psychosocial measures will be collected from participants at baseline, 1 month, 6 months and 1 year. The study's findings will have both theoretical, as well as practical, significance. Our findings will help to influence the selection and dissemination of effective outreach approaches to improve CRC screening in populations at increased risk for the disease. These results have broad applicability to understanding responses to personalized risk communication interventions for other diseases as well. Findings will also broaden our understanding of the underlying theoretical mechanisms of how remote cancer risk communications lead to improvements in cancer screening among geographically underserved populations if such intervention effects are observed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Provision of personalized risk assessment and behavioral counseling services via the telephone is likely to ensure equitable access to cancer communications for rural and other underserved groups. Such interventions have the potential to translate into improved colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates among rural dwellers at increased risk for the disease by removing geographic and other barriers to accessing potentially life-saving cancer risk communications. Our study is highly responsive to national health communication and health disparity priorities, and will provide data that are needed to influence the development and dissemination of effective cancer communication interventions to high-risk individuals who reside in geographically underserved areas.

"Colorectal Cancer Education and Screening Program (CCESP)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is an essential component to the reduction of cancer health disparities. By using CBPR with community partners, we will increase colorectal cancer screening in underserved areas. In order to increase screening, we plan to provide education and screening for Arkansans in two underserved counties in the Arkansas Delta, specifically Northeast (Mississippi County) and Southeast (St. Francis County). Both education and provision of FOBT kits with reminders are proven means of increasing screening rates. A combination of the two has not been investigated to determine if screening rates can be further improved. Based on this, we hypothesize that a CBPR intervention providing education, awareness and FOBT screening tests in two underserved communities will Increase screening uptake rates above either treatment alone or control. We will test the hypothesis through the following Specific Aims:      Specific Aim 1: Implement standard, culturally tailored, and no treatment control co-developed interventions for colorectal cancer screening in collaboration with community partners to increase uptake of colorectal screening via FOBT screening techniques.   Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy of the standard and culturally tailored screening interventions (treatment arms) on uptake of colorectal cancer screening compared to the no treatment control arm and to each other   Specific Aim 3: Develop a dissemination plan of preliminary findings to distribute to community partners and research community as they become available.      Upon completion of the CBPR intervention, the collaboration of community partners and academicians will result in reduction of CRC disparities through education, increased knowledge, and screening. Our novel approach partners academia with the community in all aspects of a CBPR study evaluating a previously unexplored combination of education and provision of FOBT cards and reminders to increase colorectal cancer screening. Further, this study will allow us to better understand factors influencing cancer screening uptake. Future studies will include the full dissemination of findings of this study and further refinement of tailored screening interventions to address various cancer disparities.          ",Colorectal Cancer Education and Screening Program (CCESP),7648085,R24MD002805,"['uptake ', ' Mississippi ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Patients ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Arkansas ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Universities ', ' Awareness ', ' Upper arm ', ' Techniques ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' County ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' community setting ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Caring ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Progress Review Group ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Adoption ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' minority health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R24,2009,492867,0.11527707826925021
"The Influence of Family and Cultural Identity on Informed Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence suggests more research is needed on how best to promote and facilitate informed decision making for colorectal cancer screening among African Americans. The long-term objective of this program of research is to decrease the colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, especially among African Americans through developing community-based interventions and methods to train healthcare providers to effectively promote colorectal cancer screening participation. The purpose of this descriptive, cross-sectional study is to examine the influence of cultural identity, family and colorectal cancer beliefs on an informed decision regarding colorectal cancer screening among African Americans. Recruited for this study will be African American men and women (N=128) 50 years and older who have or have not been screened for colorectal cancer. Informed decision making will be described using questionnaires. Participants will be recruited from the Detroit Community Network Partnership (CNP), a National Cancer Institute funded program to reduce cancer health disparities among African Americans, 50 years and older. Additionally, participants will be recruited from metropolitan Detroit barber and beauty shops and African American organizations. The conceptual model guiding this study is derived from the clinical and research experiences of the PI and the Preventative Health Model (PHM). Two specific aims will be addressed: 1) To examine the relationships among cultural identity, family influence, colorectal cancer beliefs and an informed decision regarding colorectal cancer screening in African Americans; 2) To determine if the relationships among cultural identity, family influence, colorectal cancer beliefs and an informed decision regarding colorectal cancer screening in African American men and women are different. This proposed study has been developed to fill critical gaps in nursing knowledge, cancer prevention and control research. The proposed study is also congruent with the ""Promoting Health and Preventing Disease"" area of research emphasis of the National Institute of Nursing Research to ""identify factors that influence decision-making that results in behavioral changes that promote health and prevent disease and disability."" (National Institute of Nursing Research [NINR], 2006, p. 16).

"Barriers to CRC in patients with mental illness.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequently diagnosed cancer and third leading cause of cancer death (after lung, prostate or breast cancer) in the United States. Importantly, unlike prostate, lung, and breast cancers, colorectal cancer screening may detect precancerous polyps or abnormal growth and prevent the development of CRC. With less than 40% of colorectal cancers are detected early, increasing CRC screening is important in all populations. In particular, understanding colorectal cancer screening practices is of great significance among individuals with mental illnesses, which at any given time constitutes approximately 20% of those eligible for colorectal cancer screening. There are barriers and interventions which might be specific to the population with mental illnesses, who are already more vulnerable to poor health outcomes and additionally, can be difficult to reach for treatment. Our preliminary secondary analysis of Veterans Health Administration data suggests that patients with mental illnesses have lower rates of annual fecal occult blood testing compared to an age and sex matched cohort of patients without mental illnesses. One size, one approach does not fit all. To be able to understand barriers and design appropriate interventions to improve colorectal cancer screening rates in this population, we need to first indentify screening rates and issues in various sub-groups of mental illnesses. This proposed secondary analysis study will provide us with that data and additionally, other provider and system related predictors for colorectal cancer screening in patients with mental illnesses. Our premise is that there are distinct barriers to CRC screening in sub-groups of mental illness and understanding those barriers will provide the foundation for effective intervention to improve life saving CRC screening rates. To conduct our analysis of colorectal cancer screening rates in individuals with and without the diagnosis of chronic mental illnesses, we will use a large veteran's health administration database which is the only national database with reliable measures of both primary care and psychiatric variables in one dataset. Results will provide a road map of screening disparities among individual sub-groups of mental illness. We will also identify the significance of demographic factors (such as age, sex, race) and system factors (such as having a primary care provider, frequency of visits to the primary care provider, participation in an integrated health care system involving a social worker and care coordinator) to colorectal cancer screening rates among various sub-groups of the mental illness population.

"Patient Navigation for CRC Screening with Low-Income Minorities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal Cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates are highest in African Americans (AA's) compared with all other ethnic groups. One factor that may contribute to this trend is the lower rate of participation in CRC screening among AAs, which is critical to the prevention and early detection of CRC. Recent data indicate that the removal of precancerous polyps (via colonoscopy) decreases CRC incidence by 75-90 percent. Despite the implementation of national policy changes to increase CRC screening (through Medicaid/Medicare reimbursement for CRC screening and easier ""open"" access to colonoscopy) adherence remains alarmingly low. Our preliminary data show that, even after implementation of standard patient navigation (SPN) (i.e., assisting patients with making/keeping their appointments), only 40 percent of low-income minorities followed-through on their physician recommendation. Guided by Cognitive-Behavioral Social Learning Theory as a conceptual framework and cultural targeting as an intervention strategy, the proposed randomized clinical trial will investigate integrating within SPN a targeted discussion of intrapersonal and cultural barriers to colonoscopy (i.e., fear, lack of knowledge, medical mistrust, fatalism and fear) prevalent with low-income AAs. Based on research on source credibility and reference group-based social identity theory, we will also explore navigator status as a peer on the impact of culturally targeted PN. Thus, we will compare three PN strategies: SPN carried out by a professional navigator, Culturally Targeted PN carried out by a professional (CTPN-Pro) and Culturally Targeted PN carried out by a peer who has undergone colonoscopy (CTPN-Peer). Specific Aims: Aim 1: Compare the efficacy of SPN, CTPN-Pro, and CTPN-Peer on adherence to colonoscopy CRC screening in average risk, low-income AAs who have a primary care physician referral for colonoscopy. Aim 2: Explore potential mechanisms (i.e., mediators) underlying the beneficial effects of CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer and to examine for whom the CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer are most effective (i.e., moderators). Aim 3: Compare the cost effectiveness of CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer. Cost effectiveness will be examined in terms of direct clinical costs of screening (i.e., savings associated with more efficient use of personnel, space, and equipment) and patient costs (i.e., costs of CRC treatment and the opportunity costs to the patient per life-year saved). Results from the proposed work will facilitate the broad dissemination of PN to reduce ethnic and racial health disparities in CRC incidence mortality and will advance our understanding of PN.           ",Patient Navigation for CRC Screening with Low-Income Minorities,7663247,R01CA120658,"['cost effectiveness ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Equipment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' trend ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Flexible sigmoidoscopy ', ' Fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Guidelines ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Incidence ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Policies ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Rectum ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Appointment ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Polypectomy ', ' PLYPCMY ', ' American ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' social ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Colon ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' opportunity cost ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' coping ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2009,620932,0.2507459494330408
"Tailored Interactive Multimedia to Reduce Colorectal CA Screening Disparities Background: Interactive multimedia computer programs (IMCPs) show promise as a way of delivering personally tailored (PT) information to enhance cognitive mediators of health behavior and improve patient outcomes. However, it is unclear whether PT IMCPs can be deployed in primary care offices to increase cancer screening uptake and eliminate ethnic disparities in uptake by providing PT information in each user's preferred language. Aims/Hypotheses: We will compare changes in CRC screening cognitive mediators (self- efficacy, perceived barriers, and readiness) and uptake resulting from an IMCP  PT to enhance the key cognitive mediators and targeted to patients' self-identified ethnicity - with changes resulting from a non- tailored ""electronic leaflet"" control IMCP. The experimental and control IMCPs will each be offered in English and Spanish versions. We hypothesize that, compared with the appropriate control condition (English, Spanish, or both combined): (1) the English version of the PT IMCP will enhance the cognitive mediators of CRC screening behavior for English-speaking Hispanics and non-Hispanics; (2) there will be similarly favorable changes in these mediators for Hispanics using the Spanish version of the PT IMCP; (3) deployment of the PT IMCP will provide evidence of elimination of disparities in CRC screening between Hispanic and non-Hispanic subjects via its relative impact on the cognitive mediators in these groups; and (4) the PT IMCP (English and Spanish combined) will increase CRC screening uptake in Hispanics and non-Hispanics (considered separately) via changes in the cognitive mediators. Methods: Randomized controlled trial of 2 groups, comparing a PT (to the cognitive mediators) CRC screening IMCP offered in both English and Spanish versions and deployed before a primary care office visit with a non-tailored ""electronic leaflet"" CRC screening IMCP (control) also offered in both English and Spanish. Screening methods targeted will be fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. Primary outcomes will be CRC screening uptake, self- efficacy, perceived barriers, and readiness. Implications: Our findings will determine whether an IMCP that is PT to cognitive mediators of screening behavior and deployed in primary care offices prior to previously scheduled visits can activate patients of various ethnicities to undergo CRC screening. They may also suggest a promising, portable method of reducing disparities in CRC (and other) screening uptake between Hispanic and non-Hispanic individuals.

"PEER OUTREACH TO FACILITATE COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING IN SAFETY NET CLINICS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening is an effective tool for reducing both colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, but many adults are not screened at recommended intervals. Persons of low socioeconomic status or who are uninsured have disproportionately lower rates of screening and higher rates of CRC incidence and mortality. Novel strategies are needed for this population to increase awareness of CRC and facilitate screening attempts. The long-term objectives of this project are to develop effective, sustainable, and disseminable interventions that will increase CRC screening, decrease incidence, and improve survival in underserved populations. Such efforts are critical to decreasing the current health disparities in CRC and reducing overall CRC burden in the population. The Primary Aim in this application is to assess the promise of a peer-delivered outreach intervention for increasing decisions favoring, and completion of, CRC screening among patients from urban safety-net clinics. This randomized trial will test the effectiveness of a peer-delivered intervention compared to a traditional print-based intervention for promoting CRC screening. This study will be conducted with 200 patients who are between the ages of 50 and 75 and at average-risk for CRC. Patients will complete a baseline survey on-site at the safety-net clinic at the time of recruitment and will be randomized to either a ""peer coach"" or a comparison print intervention. Our theory-based intervention incorporates constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior and Implementation Intentions Theory. Peer Coaches are community members who are employed by the clinic and trained to help patients access healthcare. The intervention will consist of three outreach counseling calls to promote and facilitate CRC screening. The comparison print intervention will consist of three mailings with targeted information about CRC screening. We will conduct a follow-up telephone survey of participants at 6-months post baseline. The primary outcome of this study is completion of any acceptable CRC screen (FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy) at six-months after baseline, measured by chart review. A secondary aim is to conduct process evaluation and demonstrate feasibility for intervening in safety-net settings. Successful completion of this R21 will inform the development of a planned full-scale R01 intervention trial to reduce disparities in CRC screening, incidence, and survival. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with better survival, but population screening rates are relatively low, especially so in low income and uninsured persons. Our study will examine the effect of an intervention using peer coaches to increase CRC screening rates in safety-net clinics. Increases in screening can have a significant impact on CRC burden in the United States.           Project Narrative Early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with better survival, but population screening rates are relatively low, especially so in low income and uninsured persons.

"CBPR Strategies to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Ohio Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): a disproportionate burden of CRC incidence and mortality, mainly due to lower utilization of recommended CRC screening tests. The Appalachian region of Ohio suffers from this burden of disease in addition to higher poverty, lower employment, and lower educational levels. To address this cancer health disparity, our health disparities research team at The Ohio State University (OSU) in partnership with four Appalachia-based community coalitions have used community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods to design and pilot test two interventions intended to increase CRC screening rates in one Appalachian county (Phase 1).  The goal of this application is to test these CRC screening interventions in 12 Ohio Appalachian counties (Phase 2) in preparation for a full-scale dissemination trial (Phase 3) in 6 additional Appalachian states within the Appalachia Community Cancer Network (ACCN).      The specific aims of this Phase 2 proposal are to: 1) utilize CBPR methods to refine specific county-level media campaigns and clinic-based messages about CRC screening (entitled ""Get Behind Your Health!"") or an attention control message (a healthy eating campaign entitled ""PEACHES"") in 12 Ohio Appalachia counties; 2) implement and test, using a group-randomized design, a staggered county-wide intervention program that compares county-specific media campaigns featuring local CRC survivors, clinic-specific charter reminder systems, and a combination of the two strategies in 6 randomly selected intervention counties to the same campaign strategies in 6 randomly selected attention control counties using county specific healthy eating campaigns featuring local farmers and educational material placed in clinics; 3) utilize process (convenience samples of county residents) and outcome evaluation (4 independent cross-sectional surveys of residents of each county) strategies to assess the efficacy of each strategy on improving CRC screening rates; and 4) utilize the results, to plan the dissemination of the intervention into 36 Appalachian counties in 6 additional states of the ACCN in a subsequent Phase 3 study.      All specific aims will be carried out using CBPR principles, in full partnership with these four Ohio Appalachian community-based cancer coalitions, and will be guided by an underlying theoretical framework of the Transtheoretical Model, in conjunction with three behavioral theories relevant to behavior change (Social Cognitive Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action, and Attitude Accessibility Theory).  The results of this study, thus, will have immediate impact in these Appalachian counties, as the community will be able to institutionalize successful strategies into existing county-wide health campaigns.          ",CBPR Strategies to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Ohio Appalachia,7628509,R24MD002785,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Employment ', ' Address ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Phase ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Incidence ', ' Evaluation ', ' farmer ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Phase III Clinical Trials ', ' phase III trial ', ' phase III protocol ', ' phase 3 trial ', ' Phase 3 Clinical Trials ', ' Ohio ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' intervention program ', ' Media Campaign ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Modality ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' County ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' dissemination trial ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' ']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2009,586128,0.18648440451113946
"Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. We will use the Pathways Framework, Community-Based Participatory Research process, and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to guide our approach to the intervention, community participation, and dissemination. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a CRC LHW + Media intervention in increasing CRC screening among Vietnamese Americans aged 50 to 74 who have never had a CRC screening test, 2) identify predictors of CRC screening, and 3) evaluate the process of community participation. Following formative research using a cognitive testing approach to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials and survey instruments, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial among Vietnamese Americans aged 50-74 in Santa Clara County California, who have never had a CRC screening test prior to recruitment. We will follow two longitudinal cohorts among whom we will conduct a pre-intervention survey of participants' knowledge, intention, and behavior as regards CRC screening; implement CRC screening educational sessions in an experimental group and nutrition educational sessions in a comparison group; and conduct a post-intervention survey. Each of the two cohorts will include 150 men and 150 women to have a total sample size of 600. The media intervention component will distribute Vietnamese-language health education materials through print and electronic media. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the frequency of screening using pre- and post-intervention surveys. To test our primary hypothesis regarding the effects of the intervention on screening activity, we will use Z-tests. We will also employ logistic regression models to test the effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for CRC screening. In addition, we will conduct process evaluation of the intervention and community participation. If this intervention is found to be effective, this LHW model could be applied in health promotion programs to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans and evaluated in other behavioral objectives and settings to reduce health disparities in other poor and underserved populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Relative to non-Hispanic whites, Vietnamese Americans are both poorer and less well medically served and have special language and cultural issues related to cancer screening that cannot be addressed though interventions aimed at the general population. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. If this intervention is found to be effective, it could be applied in other health promotion programs throughout the United States to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans. In addition, this LHW model could be evaluated in other populations, such as other racial and ethnic, poor, or immigrant communities; in other behavioral objectives, such as other forms of cancer, cardiovascular health, or tobacco, diabetes and obesity control; and in other settings, such as community health clinics and hospitals.

"A Physician-Based Trial to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Chinese    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and the third leading cause of cancer death among Chinese Americans, the largest sub-group of Asian American and Pacific Islanders. Older Chinese Americans, who are mostly immigrants, face unique cultural barriers to screening and have among the lowest CRC screening rates in the US. Physician recommendation is the most important determinant of ZRC screening in older Chinese. Unfortunately, Chinese seeking care from Chinese-speaking physicians eceive CRC screening recommendations less often than those seeing English-speaking providers. We have assembled an experienced interdisciplinary, multi-cultural, bilingual team to conduct community primary care-based research guided by the Social Cognitive Theory with Chinese physicians and their Chinese patients in the Washington DC and the Philadelphia areas. The specific aims are to develop an intervention to mprove Chinese physicians' skills in culturally appropriate communication about CRC through observational earning, and conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of this physician-based intervention on CRC screening rates among their asymptomatic Chinese-American patients ages 50 and older who are non-adherent to screening. There are more than 110 Chinese physicians in our area. We have conducted formative work with 54 Chinese American primary care physicians (PCP's) to understand their barriers to CRC screening. Results from this formative work have been used to inform the intervention. Thirty Chinese PCP's will be randomized to the intervention or the usual care group. Physicians in the intervention group will receive (1) mailed culturally appropriate educational materials on CRC screening and communication skills, tool kits for identifying patient barriers, and examples of tracking systems for screening and (2) two sessions of in-office training with standardized Chinese patients to increase skills and self-efficacy for making screening recommendations. We will also audio-tape a sample of encounters to understand actual communication about CRC screening. Preliminary results from an NCI-funded pilot study awarded since the last submission show that the mailed materials and in-office training are feasible and acceptable to Chinese physicians. The main outcome will be CRC screening rates of 600 non-adherent Chinese American patients aged 50 and older (20 per physician) one year post-intervention. This research is consistent with the NCI's plan to reduce cancer health disparities in minority groups via new intervention research to identify and successfully overcome sociocultural and health system barriers to cancer screening. The proposed research will be the first study to use a culturally appropriate, theoretically-grounded physician intervention to improve CRC screening rates in Chinese Americans.

"Understanding Racial and Ethnic Differences in Survival from Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancers are the third most common invasive cancers among men and women in the United States. Improvements in prevention, screening and treatment have resulted in decreasing case-fatality rates from colorectal cancer since the 1980s. Paradoxically, disparities in survival from this cancer especially between Blacks and Whites have widened over time. Although there is no consensus in existing literature, current evidence suggests that factors related to access to health care including socioeconomic differences contribute to these disparities. The goal of the proposed research program is to identify potentially modifiable causes of disparities in cancer survival with a long range goal of reducing or eliminating the disproportionate burden of colorectal cancer among certain patient populations. The specific aims for this project are to: 1) compare colorectal cancer survival rates by race/ethnicity over the period 1993 through 2004; 2) compare the distribution of tumor stage at diagnosis for colorectal cancer by race/ethnicity; 3) examine potential mediators of the relationship of survival and race/ethnicity among colorectal cancer patients; 4) examine the patterns of care of survivors of colorectal cancer; and 5) explore the effect of socioeconomic status on the relationship between race/ethnicity and survival among colorectal cancer patients. This project will be conducted on a large racially diverse cohort comprised of patients 20 years and older diagnosed with colorectal cancer (1993 to 2004) while enrolled in one of four integrated health care systems that are affiliated with the National Cancer Institute-funded Cancer Research Network. This research plan is part of a career development program aimed at providing the training and experience needed for Dr. Doubeni to become an independently funded clinician-investigator focusing on disparities in cancer survival. The objectives of the career development plan are to acquire knowledge and skills in: 1) cancer biology, epidemiology and treatment; 2) advanced research methods; 3) scientific writing; and 4) the translation of research into practice and policy. The career development program will be accomplished through mentoring and targeted advanced courses. The studies encompassed under the proposed research program will make important contributions to our understanding of racial/ethnic differences in cancer survival rates. The proposed project will lay the foundation for the candidate's long-term career goal of designing system-based interventions aimed at eliminating disparities in cancer care and survival, a major objective of HealthyPeople 2010.          ",Understanding Racial and Ethnic Differences in Survival from Colorectal Cancer,7667252,K01CA127118,"['Principal Investigator ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Foundations ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Survivors ', ' Incidence ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' patient population ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Tumor stage ', ' T-Stage ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Caring ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Research Network ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K01,2009,141539,0.1517192577714638
"Colon cancer disparity elimination: a faith-based participatory partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elimination of the glaring colorectal cancer-related disparities in African Americans (AA) IS POSSIBLE. In this community based participatory research project (CPBR), we address both the SUPPLY and DEMAND components of the solution. Employing the community consultants and physicians successfully trained in Phase I, we have an adequate provider base to satisfy the increased demand resulting from this faith oriented barrier-free colonoscopy screening initiative. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is predominately preventable through screening for and removal of precancerous polyps. Unfortunately every year over 50,000 Americans of all races die unnecessarily. Multiple barriers result in an unacceptable disparity in both incidence and mortality for the AA, with the result that the death rate for AA males with advanced CRC cancer is double that for white males. The discovery of the evolution of CRC from benign polyps gives physicians ample time to remove the offending tissue prior to the development of cancers. The importance for screening in the AA population is accentuated by the documented shorter interval from the appearance of a polyp until its malignant transformation. We also know that colonoscopy is the ""gold standard."" The current capacity for performing colonoscopy is far below what is needed to screen the at-risk population as recent data reveals that only one-third of the appropriate population is compliant. In addition to capacity issues, many barriers to screening are patient related characteristics such as knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, cultural and ethnic issues, acceptability of screening method(s), ability to pay, and other socioeconomic and environmental issues (i.e. transportation, stigma, social support, etc.). Although over 80% of colonoscopies are provided by gastroenterologists, less than 4% in training are AA, fostering a growing gap in culturally competent colonoscopy providers. Using a triangulated theoretical framework including the Health Belief Model, the Social Cognitive Theory and the RE-AIM Evaluation model, we will further demonstrate a successful solution to addressing both SUPPLY (capacity for colorectal screening) and DEMAND (targeted patient access to and utilization of colorectal screening). The Phase I study confirmed that compliance can be achieved comparable to that for breast cancer screening (75%). The astounding high-rate of neoplasia (4%) emphasizes the critical importance of this endeavor.           ",Colon cancer disparity elimination: a faith-based participatory partnership,7669372,R24MD002812,"['Provider ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Endoscopy ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Specialized Center ', ' P50 Program ', ' P50 Mechanism ', ' Monitor ', ' Evolution ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Gastroenterology ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Incidence ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Americas ', ' male ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Gastroenterologist ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' neoplasia ', ' Glare ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Polyps ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stigmata ', ' Solutions ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' South Carolina ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transportation ', ' Attitude ', ' Caucasians ', ' Hour ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Belief ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' outreach ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Appearance ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' County ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' outreach program ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' phase I trial ', ' phase I protocol ', ' phase 1 trial ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Colorectal Polyp ', ' large intestine polyp ', ' large bowel polyp ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' volunteer ', ' community based participatory research ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' ']",NIMHD,EAU CLAIRE COOPERATIVE HEALTH CENTER,R24,2009,43044,0.07109534291218422
"Colorectal Cancer Screening in a Diverse Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am a primary care physician and researcher, who is committed to understanding and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in cancer.  If granted this award, I will build upon my Master's in Public Health degree and my prior research experience to advance my knowledge and skills through coursework, mentored research, apprentice-style learning and semi-structured training.  The University of Texas Medical Branch is especially committed to improving the health of the diverse and underserved local populations we serve, through high quality patient care and ongoing research and is very supportive of my career development plan.  I have integrated the coursework and research activities so that I can achieve my objectives.  The long-term objective of the proposed research is to explain and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in colorectal cancer disease burden.  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the USA, accounting for ten percent of all cancer deaths.  As with other cancers, African Americans carry an unequal burden from this disease, they have the highest incidence and mortality of all racial/ethnic groups.  There is now good evidence that screening for colorectal cancer reduces mortality from this disease and currently five screening options are recommended.  However, national self-reported screening data suggests that screening levels are poor, especially in minority groups.  The higher mortality in African Americans is thought to be due in part to their higher incidence and in part due to their lower screening rates.  The research in this plan will address this underutilization of screening about which many unanswered questions remain: there is uncertainty about the accuracy of self-reported screening data, especially in minority patients, and there remains a lack of understanding as to the mechanisms through which race/ethnicity affects screening behavior both for African Americans and Hispanics.  In order to address these issues, we plan a series of related aims in a population of African American, Hispanic and Non-Hispanic white patients.  We propose a cross-sectional study utilizing a survey instrument that will be developed especially for use in our racial/ethnically diverse population.  The purpose of the first aim of our study is to determine the prevalence of age and risk appropriate screening in our patient population.  The second aim will determine the accuracy of self-reported information by comparing patient responses to medical record information.  The third aim will examine the mechanisms through which a person's race/ethnicity determines their colorectal cancer screening behavior; we will examine how patient factors, health care system factors and patients' interactions with their environment correlate with self-reported screening behavior.  The fourth aim will involve describing patient preferences for the array of CRC screening tests and systematically evaluating other influences on CRC screening such as health care delivery systems and physician factors and finally integrating all this information to design an intervention to increase CRC screening in all groups and to submit it for an R01 application prior to the end of the award.               ",Colorectal Cancer Screening in a Diverse Population,7668439,K07CA107052,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Commit ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Affect ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Age ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Incidence ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Research Activity ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentors ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' instrument ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Universities ', ' Clinic ', ' Award ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Accounting ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' billing data ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' patient population ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K07,2009,126896,0.24871448739205412
"Patient Navigation for CRC Screening with Low-Income Minorities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal Cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates are highest in African Americans (AA's) compared with all other ethnic groups. One factor that may contribute to this trend is the lower rate of participation in CRC screening among AAs, which is critical to the prevention and early detection of CRC. Recent data indicate that the removal of precancerous polyps (via colonoscopy) decreases CRC incidence by 75-90 percent. Despite the implementation of national policy changes to increase CRC screening (through Medicaid/Medicare reimbursement for CRC screening and easier ""open"" access to colonoscopy) adherence remains alarmingly low. Our preliminary data show that, even after implementation of standard patient navigation (SPN) (i.e., assisting patients with making/keeping their appointments), only 40 percent of low-income minorities followed-through on their physician recommendation. Guided by Cognitive-Behavioral Social Learning Theory as a conceptual framework and cultural targeting as an intervention strategy, the proposed randomized clinical trial will investigate integrating within SPN a targeted discussion of intrapersonal and cultural barriers to colonoscopy (i.e., fear, lack of knowledge, medical mistrust, fatalism and fear) prevalent with low-income AAs. Based on research on source credibility and reference group-based social identity theory, we will also explore navigator status as a peer on the impact of culturally targeted PN. Thus, we will compare three PN strategies: SPN carried out by a professional navigator, Culturally Targeted PN carried out by a professional (CTPN-Pro) and Culturally Targeted PN carried out by a peer who has undergone colonoscopy (CTPN-Peer). Specific Aims: Aim 1: Compare the efficacy of SPN, CTPN-Pro, and CTPN-Peer on adherence to colonoscopy CRC screening in average risk, low-income AAs who have a primary care physician referral for colonoscopy. Aim 2: Explore potential mechanisms (i.e., mediators) underlying the beneficial effects of CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer and to examine for whom the CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer are most effective (i.e., moderators). Aim 3: Compare the cost effectiveness of CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer. Cost effectiveness will be examined in terms of direct clinical costs of screening (i.e., savings associated with more efficient use of personnel, space, and equipment) and patient costs (i.e., costs of CRC treatment and the opportunity costs to the patient per life-year saved). Results from the proposed work will facilitate the broad dissemination of PN to reduce ethnic and racial health disparities in CRC incidence mortality and will advance our understanding of PN.

"Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. We will use the Pathways Framework, Community-Based Participatory Research process, and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to guide our approach to the intervention, community participation, and dissemination. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a CRC LHW + Media intervention in increasing CRC screening among Vietnamese Americans aged 50 to 74 who have never had a CRC screening test, 2) identify predictors of CRC screening, and 3) evaluate the process of community participation. Following formative research using a cognitive testing approach to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials and survey instruments, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial among Vietnamese Americans aged 50-74 in Santa Clara County California, who have never had a CRC screening test prior to recruitment. We will follow two longitudinal cohorts among whom we will conduct a pre-intervention survey of participants' knowledge, intention, and behavior as regards CRC screening; implement CRC screening educational sessions in an experimental group and nutrition educational sessions in a comparison group; and conduct a post-intervention survey. Each of the two cohorts will include 150 men and 150 women to have a total sample size of 600. The media intervention component will distribute Vietnamese-language health education materials through print and electronic media. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the frequency of screening using pre- and post-intervention surveys. To test our primary hypothesis regarding the effects of the intervention on screening activity, we will use Z-tests. We will also employ logistic regression models to test the effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for CRC screening. In addition, we will conduct process evaluation of the intervention and community participation. If this intervention is found to be effective, this LHW model could be applied in health promotion programs to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans and evaluated in other behavioral objectives and settings to reduce health disparities in other poor and underserved populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Relative to non-Hispanic whites, Vietnamese Americans are both poorer and less well medically served and have special language and cultural issues related to cancer screening that cannot be addressed though interventions aimed at the general population. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. If this intervention is found to be effective, it could be applied in other health promotion programs throughout the United States to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans. In addition, this LHW model could be evaluated in other populations, such as other racial and ethnic, poor, or immigrant communities; in other behavioral objectives, such as other forms of cancer, cardiovascular health, or tobacco, diabetes and obesity control; and in other settings, such as community health clinics and hospitals.

"RCT/Increase Colon Cancer Screening/Medicaid Managed Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Disparities persist in the colorectal cancer screening. There is need for practical, widely applicable interventions that could correct these disparities. Through previous work (R01-87776) we have developed a Prevention Care Management (PCM) intervention based on telephone support that increased colon cancer screening rates for low income women visiting community/migrant health centers in New York City almost two fold. The earlier project relied on research staff to recruit patients in community/migrant health center (C/MHC) waiting rooms and to provide the intervention, thus, limiting its transportability and sustainability.   This new project in response to PAR 04-036 will be based in Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MMCOs) which can provide sustainable, widely available infrastructures to support colon cancer screening especially for women who comprise a substantial majority of MMCO enrollees. Our first aim is to expand the scope of PCM to apply to MMCO-enrolled women who seldom visit primary care (outreach) while continuing to provide inreach to more frequent attenders. The second aim is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the expanded PCM intervention to assess its impact on colorectal cancer screening status of low-income women age 50-64 years and to describe the process of Prevention Care Management.    Several unique features of the project should be noted: the identification of women overdue for screening through MMCO claims data which is both practical to sustain and expands the reach of the project to include women who seldom visit primary care; the intervention will be delivered by established MMCO staff, not researchers appearing transiently but cannot sustain the intervention; outcomes will be assessed through MMCO claims data; and multiple representative MMCOs in New York City will be involved.

"A Physician-Based Trial to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Chinese    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and the third leading cause of cancer death among Chinese Americans, the largest sub-group of Asian American and Pacific Islanders. Older Chinese Americans, who are mostly immigrants, face unique cultural barriers to screening and have among the lowest CRC screening rates in the US. Physician recommendation is the most important determinant of ZRC screening in older Chinese. Unfortunately, Chinese seeking care from Chinese-speaking physicians eceive CRC screening recommendations less often than those seeing English-speaking providers. We have assembled an experienced interdisciplinary, multi-cultural, bilingual team to conduct community primary care-based research guided by the Social Cognitive Theory with Chinese physicians and their Chinese patients in the Washington DC and the Philadelphia areas. The specific aims are to develop an intervention to mprove Chinese physicians' skills in culturally appropriate communication about CRC through observational earning, and conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of this physician-based intervention on CRC screening rates among their asymptomatic Chinese-American patients ages 50 and older who are non-adherent to screening. There are more than 110 Chinese physicians in our area. We have conducted formative work with 54 Chinese American primary care physicians (PCP's) to understand their barriers to CRC screening. Results from this formative work have been used to inform the intervention. Thirty Chinese PCP's will be randomized to the intervention or the usual care group. Physicians in the intervention group will receive (1) mailed culturally appropriate educational materials on CRC screening and communication skills, tool kits for identifying patient barriers, and examples of tracking systems for screening and (2) two sessions of in-office training with standardized Chinese patients to increase skills and self-efficacy for making screening recommendations. We will also audio-tape a sample of encounters to understand actual communication about CRC screening. Preliminary results from an NCI-funded pilot study awarded since the last submission show that the mailed materials and in-office training are feasible and acceptable to Chinese physicians. The main outcome will be CRC screening rates of 600 non-adherent Chinese American patients aged 50 and older (20 per physician) one year post-intervention. This research is consistent with the NCI's plan to reduce cancer health disparities in minority groups via new intervention research to identify and successfully overcome sociocultural and health system barriers to cancer screening. The proposed research will be the first study to use a culturally appropriate, theoretically-grounded physician intervention to improve CRC screening rates in Chinese Americans. If effective, this intervention will be highly transportable and have broad reach to physician audiences and increase screening in the growing Chinese population. This approach should also be broadly portable to developing culturally appropriate primary care cancer control interventions in other minority groups.

"Colorectal cancer risk after colonoscopy in elderly diabetes patient and men    DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. Colonoscopy is widely used to screen for CRC. Current guidelines recommend screening colonoscopy once every 10 years in average risk patients over >50 year who have no polyps identified at colonoscopy (i.e., negative colonoscopy). However, the prevalence of CRC and polyps increase with age. In addition, nearly 1/4 of the U.S. population over 60 years of age have diabetes mellitus (DM). Recent data suggest patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have an increased risk of CRC. Furthermore, population-based cancer incidence data have consistently suggested a higher incidence of CRC among men vs. women, and the disparity is most striking among those >65 years. Hence, the negative predictive value of a negative colonoscopy may be lower in patients >65 years who are male or have DM. As a result, there is uncertainty whether the recommended 10-year interval between screening colonoscopies in whom no polyps were identified should apply to elderly men or elderly DM patients. We hypothesize that among patients over the age of 65, the risk of CRC following a negative colonoscopy is higher in men vs. women, and in DM patients vs. non-DM patients. To test this hypothesis, we have designed a population-based cohort study using the linked SEERMedicare   data. The study will determine among the SEER-Medicare population, 1) whether men who have   undergone a negative colonoscopy have a higher subsequent incidence of CRC than women with a   negative colonoscopy; 2) whether DM patients who have undergone a negative colonoscopy have a higher subsequent incidence of CRC than non-DM patients with a negative colonoscopy; 3) whether men or DM patients who have undergone a negative colonoscopy have a lower incidence of CRC than the general SEER-Medicare population who have not undergone colonoscopy and whether the lower incidence persists for up to 10 years; 4) determine the absolute incidence by time of CRC following a colonoscopy without polyps for men, women, all patients with diabetes, men with diabetes, and women with diabetes. Both relative and absolute risks will be examined during the follow-up period. Subgroup analysis will examine the risk for proximal colon cancer and the combined effect of male sex and DM.      Relevance to Public Health: CRC is a common cause of death among the elderly population. Screening for colorectal cancer can reduce the risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality. Given the increased incidence of CRC in elderly male patients or elderly DM patients, it is important to determine whether the recommended 10-year interval between colonoscopies without polyps offers adequate protection to these high risk groups. Our study will help establish the appropriate time interval for elderly men and elderly DM patients to undergo a second colonoscopy following a negative colonoscopy so that they will not be facing an unacceptably high rate of preventable CRC morbidity and mortality.           Given the increased incidence of CRC in elderly male patients or elderly DM patients, it is important to determine whether the recommended 10-year interval between colonoscopies without polyps offers adequate protection to these high risk groups.

"Training African American Peers as Patient Navigators for Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer health disparities related to race and ethnicity are among the most serious problems facing the US health care system. A recent Institute of Medicine report stated that such disparities are seen at every level of health care, from prevention to treatment and follow-up. This problem is acutely evident in the figures for colorectal cancer (CRC) among African Americans (AAs). According to the American Cancer Society, AAs have the highest CRC incidence and mortality of any ethnic/racial group. Indeed, CRC incidence and mortality are 15% and 43% higher among AAs than Whites, respectively. These disparities could be effectively reduced through greater AA participation in CRC screening and early detection. More importantly, due to the preponderance of CRC in AAs beyond the reach of the flexible sigmoidoscopy, increased adherence to colonoscopy among AAs will save lives. Although there is clear evidence that providing patients with someone to help them manage/navigate the health care system (i.e., patient navigation (PN)) is effective in helping them to complete cancer screening, very few hospitals provide PN for colonoscopy. The vast majority of hospitals in NYC are unable to provide PN for patients for whom colonoscopy is recommended, in large part because of the costs associated with professional-led PN. The proposed R-25E seeks to address this serious public health problem by investigating the success of training AAs who have undergone colonoscopy to serve as peer patient navigators to help others from their community complete CRC screening via colonoscopy.       The proposed training plan is supported by seven distinct lines of evidence: 1) research indicating a 76-90% reduction in CRC mortality through colonoscopy, 2) the success of PN in increasing participation in health promotion, 3) data from the NYC Department of Health showing underuse of PN for colonoscopy, 4) research demonstrating increased credibility of peers in providing health information, 5) research on volunteer-led health education interventions, 6) the cost savings we found in our preliminary research on peer led PN (PPN) for colonoscopy, and 7) our success in promoting cancer screening and preventative health care practices in AA communities of New York City through our collaboration with community leaders and church groups.       The overall goal of the proposed R-25E is to reduce CRC morbidity and mortality by increasing AA participation in colonoscopy in a cost effective way. This will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) The development and implementation of a training program for Peer Patient Navigation (PPN) to increase participation of AAs in colonoscopy; 2) The examination of the cost effectiveness of the PPN training program in completion of colonoscopy from the perspective of AAs for whom colonoscopy is recommended; and 3) The investigation of the relative cost effectiveness of the PPN training program from the perspective of hospitals.                   ",Training African American Peers as Patient Navigators for Colon Cancer Screening,7672404,R25CA132692,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Flexible sigmoidoscopy ', ' Fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Hospitals ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Incidence ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' New York City ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Review Literature ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Role playing therapy ', ' role playing (psychodrama) ', ' Role Playing ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Supervision ', ' Tape Recording ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Training Programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' success ', ' peer ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Prevention ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Cost Savings ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' skill acquisition ', ' volunteer ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R25,2009,318344,0.063774931631833
"Cancer Control Dissemination to Asian Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of our proposal is to disseminate an evidence-based intervention designed for one Asian ethnic population to a different Asian ethnic population with overlapping cultural and health beliefs. In collaboration with International Community Health Services (ICHS), a community agency serving many Asian ethnic groups, we have three specific objectives for the proposed research:  Replicate an effective colorectal cancer (CRC) screening intervention for Vietnamese Americans that was originally designed for Chinese Americans.  Evaluate the dissemination of this replicated intervention through a quasi-experimental study.  Collect and examine dissemination process data. Based on principles from Diffusion of Innovation Theory, we proposed to replicate an intervention with a 42% effect size. The replicated intervention will consist of a Vietnamese language video and bilingual pamphlet. We will translate and dub into Vietnamese our award-winning Chinese-language video, ""Being a Winner in Life: How to Prevent Colorectal Cancer."" The Chinese/English pamphlet will also be translated into Vietnamese. To provide feedback on the translated video script and pamphlet, we will convene 4 focus groups with Vietnamese men and women. Subsequently, we will introduce these materials to the intervention clinic staff at in-service training presentations and specifically recommend that intervention clinic medical assistants distribute the intervention materials. To evaluate the dissemination of this replicated intervention, our quantitative analysis will examine the Reach and Effectiveness based on the RE-AIM framework through a quasi-experimental study over an 18-month period. There are 919 and 802 age-eligible Vietnamese patients at the intervention and control clinic respectively. To determine the Effectiveness of the intervention, the primary outcome will be changes in CRC screening adherence rates at the intervention and control clinics. We will randomly select 25% of the patients from each clinic for pre- and post-intervention chart audits and use the Generalized Estimating Equation to model CRC screening adherence at the two clinics at pre- and post-intervention. Process evaluation will examine Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance at the intervention clinic. We will collect qualitative data from 10 key informant interviews with ICHS management personnel and intervention clinic staff. In addition, 3 focus groups with medical assistants, the intervention agents, anof two focus groups with Vietnamese patients at the intervention clinic will also be completed.           ",Cancer Control Dissemination to Asian Americans,7658102,R01CA124397,"['Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Services ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' population health ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' computerized data processing ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' International ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' informant ', ' Feedback ', ' Adoption ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medical ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Japan ', ' Korea ', ' Language ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' post intervention ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Funding ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Personnel Management ', ' Philosophy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Translating ', ' Vietnam ', ' Viet Nam ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Reporting ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' Chinese American ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2009,310889,0.14292404996716015
"A Population Based Policy Model for Colorectal Cancer In the first CISNET project we developed a population-based Monte Carlo simulation model that evaluates  national trends in the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). The HSPH-CISNET Model  incorporates age-, sex-, and race-specific trends in CRC risk factors, screening, and treatment, as well as  the effects of risk factors and screening on the underlying natural history of colorectal disease and the  effectiveness of treatment for patients with diagnosed CRC. The Model currently simulates the US  population aged 25 years and older from 1970 to 2020. We have used the Model to examine the relative  contribution of changes in risk factors, screening, and treatment to the overall population trends in CRC  incidence and mortality.  The purpose of this project is to use the HSPH-CISNET Model to evaluate the population impact of existing  cancer control strategies, as well as the impact of strategies on the horizon. Of particular importance is to  incorporate the associations between risk factors and screening trends, and to determine the potential  impact of disparities in CRC risk and mortality at a population level. Other aims will focus on evaluating the  population-level impact of specific risk factor trends, screening modalities, and treatment advancements.  To validate our modeling assumptions, we will use our model structure to simulate the population of  Norway, a country that does not have a CRC screening program, in an attempt to re-create their incidence  and mortality statistics. We will continue to collaborate with other modeling groups, as well as with the new  CRC Coordinating Center and the NCI to focus on questions that apply across all modeling groups. In  addition, we propose a concrete plan for making our model more accessible to outside collaborators. This  plan involves posting the model structure on a public website, sharing code with established outside  investigators, and providing the necessary model support.

"Geographic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Survival    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. Despite declines in CRC incidence rates, survival following diagnosis has improved only modestly over the past few decades. Even though environmental contexts play an important role in health, disease, and behavior, most studies about CRC survival have largely ignored the geographic variation and importance of area-level socioeconomic conditions that have been associated with CRC screening, CRC stage at diagnosis, and with the survival of many other cancers. CRC patients who live in areas with worse socioeconomic conditions have decreased survival than those who live under more affluent conditions; however, the mechanisms by which these area-level factors exert their influence on CRC survival remain unclear. This amended application of the proposed population-based, prospective study has three specific aims. Aim 1) Determine the extent of the geographic variation of CRC survival across the United States based on small geographic areas at the sub-county (census-tract) level using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data for over 100,000 men and women aged 66 or older diagnosed with CRC. Aim 2) Determine the extent to which lower CRC survival can be explained by higher area socioeconomic deprivation among persons age 66 and older. Aim 3) Identify potential mediating pathways by which higher area socioeconomic deprivation is associated with lower CRC survival among persons age 66 and older, namely a) patient characteristics, b) physician and hospital characteristics, c) tumor characteristics, d) type of treatment received, and e) surveillance for CRC after diagnosis to detect recurrence and metastases. A multilevel spatial model will be developed to address the specific aims of the proposed study. We will use the following existing data sources: 1) 1992-2005 data from NCI's SEER program (survival, patient characteristics, type of treatment, tumor characteristics); 2) 1991-2005 Medicare data (patient characteristics, type of treatment, surveillance after diagnosis) which is linked to the SEER data; 3) 1991-2005 data from the Provider of Services File (hospital and physician characteristics), 4) 1990-2005 census data (area deprivation measures), and 5) Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data. Advanced Bayesian spatial analyses of CRC survival will be performed and a geographic information system will be used to display the results. Our study will increase understanding of and identify important mechanisms of the role of area-level socioeconomic deprivation on CRC survival. In addition, this study will help provide opportunities for targeting specific geographic areas to allocate resources and interventions locally to improve CRC survival using evidence- based approaches, thereby reducing health disparities associated with living in socioeconomically deprived areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths. To reduce geographic disparities in survival following colorectal cancer and to develop and implement interventions that can be targeted locally, it is imperative to identify reasons for lower-than-expected survival.              Narrative Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths.

"An Interactive Colorectal Cancer Screening Promotion Intervention for Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this study is to develop an effective education intervention that increases screening adherence to colorectal cancer screening guidelines and reduces the rates of late-stage detection and preventable mortality among medically underserved Latinos. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) develop culturally and linguistically appropriate colorectal cancer screening and risk reduction information designed for low- income, low literacy Latinos, (2) develop digital multimedia touchscreen kiosks to deliver interactive colorectal cancer screening and risk reduction information to low-income, low literacy Latinos, (3) evaluate the efficacy of an interactive, multimedia kiosk intervention to increase knowledge about colorectal cancer risk and promote screening and other risk reduction behaviors among low-income, low literacy Latinos, and (4) evaluate the acceptance of the interactive, multimedia kiosk by clinical providers and low-income, low literacy Latinos receiving the intervention. The HHS Initiative to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities calls attention to the gaps in access to preventive health services for low-income, medically underserved individuals. This study to develop and evaluate a colorectal cancer screening promotion intervention for medically underserved Latinos responds to the National Cancer Institute's program on Interactive Media Technologies in Cancer Prevention, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control to promote the use of innovative media technology and/or communication approaches in cancer prevention and control applications used in medical and community settings. The intervention study employs a randomized controlled design. Study participants will be given a pretest and randomly assigned to either an intervention or control condition in equal numbers. The intervention group will be exposed to an interactive, multimedia colorectal cancer education intervention while the control group will receive standard care, which means they will not receive any CRC education materials. Six-months from baseline, a post-test will be administered to both intervention and control groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study addresses the health disparity of preventable colorectal cancer mortality among Latinos due to low screening rates and correspondingly high rates of late-stage detection. If the efficacy of this education intervention to improve screening adherence is demonstrated in this study, interactive kiosks offer the means for deployment of an intervention on a national scale to significantly impact colorectal cancer screening rates and thereby reduce mortality.              Project Narrative The study addresses the health disparity of preventable colorectal cancer mortality among Latinos due to low screening rates and correspondingly high rates of late-stage detection.

"Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Americans Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, affecting both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups. The majority of these deaths could be prevented since CRC, when discovered early, is highly treatable and screening that leads to removal of adenomatous polyps decreases CRC incidence by 75% to 90%. Nationally, in 2002, only 50% of adults aged 50 or older reported having had any screening test in the recommended intervals. Both CRC incidence and mortality rates are higher among African Americans than any other racial group. These health disparities are due, in part, to delay in diagnosis resulting in advanced stage disease at presentation. Lower rates of CRC screening participation among African Americans contribute to this burden. Interactive computer-based interventions effectively promote health behavior change by delivering individualized, or tailored, health information and counseling. In pilot testing, a tailored, interactive computer intervention designed to promote CRC screening among African Americans resulted in increased CRC knowledge and higher rates of fecal occult blood testing. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a tailored, interactive computer intervention to promote CRC screening by comparing it to, and combining it with, a physician recommendation, which has been found to be a significant predictor of CRC screening. A sample of 1248 African American men and women who are being seen in two Midwestern primary care networks and who are non-adherent to colon cancer screening guidelines will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) a CRC screening brochure; 2) an interactive computer intervention; or 3) the interactive computer intervention plus the brochure. Both process and outcome variables will be examined. Rates of adherence to fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are primary outcomes examined at 6 and 15 months. Logistic regression models will be used to test intervention effects separately for two outcomes, fecal occult blood testing (initial and repeat) and endoscopic screening, while adjusting for potentially confounding covariates. Mediators and moderators of intervention effects and changes in health beliefs related to the interventions also will be determined.         ",Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Americans,7617157,R01CA115983,"['Environment ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Progress Review Group ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Adoption ', ' Guidelines ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' minority health ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Adenomatous Polyps ', ' polypoid adenoma ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Staging ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Sigmoidoscopy ', ' Proctosigmoidoscopy ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' cancer risk ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Gender ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Documentation ', ' Colon ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' population based ', ' primary care setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' Computers ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' ']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2009,448552,0.27224856090747285
"Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening for Patients with Multiple Morbidities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Appalachian and rural underserved residents, in general, experience higher rates of multiple morbidities (MM) with fewer resources to prevent and manage disease. Some researchers have speculated that the well-documented cancer health disparities affecting Appalachians may be attributable to multiple morbidity management demands which may deprioritize essential and efficacious cancer screenings. In this pilot study, we examine whether and how multiple morbidities affect colorectal cancer screening rates. Our long-term goal is to turn this disadvantageous situation of competing time and resource pressure into an advantage by increasing cancer screening services during the more frequent medical interactions of those with multiple morbidities. Addressing the nearly three-quarters of middle aged and older adults with MM is essential due to skyrocketing rates of MM, higher rates of cancer mortality among those with MM, and competing demands of disease prevention and management. We aim to expand our limited understanding of the association between MM and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening through three research activities. First, to obtain rich insights into the factors and circumstances that affect patterns of CRC screening behavior among those with multiple morbidities, in-depth interviews will be conducted with 5 health care providers representing diverse practices in Appalachia and with 40 patients who have two or more chronic diseases. These interviews will provide locally grounded perspectives from the two most salient health decision makers, providers and patients. Second, to insure generalizability, we will assess the impact of factors germane to both MM and CRC screening behavior by conducting a stratified representative survey of Appalachians. Finally, after identifying factors, circumstances, and patterns that prevent CRC screening in the context of multiple morbidities, we will hold focus groups to validate our findings and discuss optimal direction for interventions. Ultimately, these findings will lead to the development of a community-based participatory intervention R01 that will capitalize on the relatively frequent medical care visits of those with multiple morbidities and ultimately will increase CRC screening, improve practice coordination, and decrease cancer-associated deaths. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US, the majority of the ever-growing middle aged and older population has multiple morbidities or several chronic diseases. Having multiple morbidities generally decreases the likelihood of receiving highly effective cancer prevention, like colorectal cancer screening. This project uses innovative methods to determine the reasons why those with multiple morbidities may be less likely to get colorectal cancer screening and will eventually develop a culturally consistent intervention for the underserved rural health disparities population of Appalachia to increase early detection of this deadly cancer.          ",Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening for Patients with Multiple Morbidities,7625156,R21CA129881,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Secondary Cancer Prevention ', ' Older Population ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Rural ', ' Research Activity ', ' Mass Media ', ' mass information media ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' pressure ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Health ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Media Campaign ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' outreach ', ' Gender ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Rural Community ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communities ', ' underserved rural area ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' successful intervention ', ' routine provider ', ' Computers ', ' Consultations ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R21,2009,164813,0.25566996110245377
"MEHARRY CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The objective of the Clinical Research Center (CRC) at MMC is to support clinical research to improve the health of African Americans and other populations with health disparities, and to increase the nation's pool of minority physicians and dentists carrying out clinical research. The specific aims are:   1) to strengthen the administrative infrastructure of the CRC and to diversify the clinical research activities in the CRC by developing initiatives in oral health, community health, clinical pharmacology, and a collaborative clinical research network; 2) to increase the type and quality of direct research support available to both junior and experienced clinical research faculty; and 3) to increase the number of medical and dental faculty conducting clinical research using the CRC.  Aim 1 is to strengthen and expand the CRC and will be achieved by developing a core management team (MT) to improve resource utilization, financial management, to provide assistance to investigators with clinical trials, and to prepare timely management reports.  The Associate Director of Oral Health Disparity Research will provide leadership for increasing dental faculty clinical research.  A Research Subject Advocate (RSA) will ensure that the safety of research subjects is accorded the highest priority. To diversify clinical research, the CRC will develop collaborative research with community health centers and other RCRll clinical research centers, as well as a clinical pharmacology program.  Aim 2 will increase the type and quality of direct research support, which will be accomplished by hiring a biostatistician/epidemiologist with clinical trial experience and a data analyst to meet increasing requests for assistance with clinical study design, study methodology, data management, and manuscript preparation.  Two research assistants, a bilingual research nurse and a community field research nurse, will be added to improve patient recruitment and community outreach, and to accommodate the increasing number of researchers and types of clinical research activities.  In year 02, a bioinformatics manager will be hired to develop and integrate computational tools to facilitate multidisciplinary clinical research.  In year 03, a clinical pharmacologist will be hired to develop and implement clinical pharmacology studies within the CRC.  Aim 3 involves strategies for increasing the number of MMC clinical researchers in medicine and dentistry, including short-term ""seed"" funding to stimulate investigator-initiated research projects, and long-term funding for faculty-developed clinical research projects, which have the potential for extramural funding.  Other faculty development initiatives include:  1) monthly CRC Clinical Science Seminars; 2) interdisciplinary Clinical Research Seminars; 3) an annual symposium on health disparities research; 4) grantsmanship workshops; and 5) courses on clinical research for faculty, residents, and students.  With these enhancements, the CRC will take on a leadership role in the expansion of clinical research at the college and will become a national source of expertise on clinical research targeting health disparities.      The CRC Administrative Core (AC) is responsible for providing leadership, management of the daily operation of the CRC, recruitment of new staff, and for the formulation and implementation of initiatives to enhance clinical research at MMC.  Specific Aim 1 is to strengthen the administrative infrastructure of the CRC and diversify the range of clinical research activities in the CRC by developing initiatives in oral health, community health, clinical pharmacology, and a collaborative clinical research network.  A Core MT will be assembled to improve the management of CRC resources, CRC finances, clinical trials, report preparation, and stakeholder communication.  The Associate Director for Oral Health Research will develop initiatives to expand the utilization of the CRC by the School of Dentistry and increase the number of clinical research studies in the area of oral health disparities.  The RSA will ensure that research subject safety is accorded the highest priority. The Clinical Research Advisory Committee (CRAC) and External Advisory Committee (EAC) involvement in CRC development and evaluation will be strengthened.  A CRC website and other tools for marketing the CRC and communicating with potential clinical investigators will be developed.  Initiatives will also be developed to increase the number of clinical research studies in the areas of health disparity research including cancer, cardiovascular, infectious disease, HIV/AIDS, neurological/behavioral, and infant mortality.  The MT will develop relationships with community health centers to expand CRC activities in population-based, patient-oriented research, and community outreach.  The MT will participate in the planning and implementation of a Clinical Research Network in conjunction with other RCRII CRCs.  A plan for expanding the capacity for clinical pharmacology research will be developed that will include pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenomics, and a clinical pharmacologist will be hired in year 03.  These initiatives will correct the major weaknesses identified by the EAC, will move the CRC towards the long-term objective of General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) status, and ensure that it becomes a national resource for clinical research targeting health disparities.

"Promoting Health Literacy for Colorectal Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term goal of this project is to decrease colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality through encouraging informed decision making about routine CRC screening (CRCS). National data indicate that current rates of CRC screening do not approach Health People 2010 targets. There is evidence that low health literacy adversely impacts access to care and receipt of preventive health care services including cancer screening. This exploratory/developmental research grant (R21), titled ""Promoting Health Literacy for Colorectal Cancer Screening,"" will use an entertainment education approach to promote informed decision making about CRCS among men and women with low health literacy, who are presenting for health care in urban community health centers. Entertainment education is the process of purposely designing and implementing media that incorporate educational messages in an entertaining format, and is a promising strategy for communicating health information to patients with low health literacy. The specific aims of this project are as follows: 1) Use a participatory research approach, representing the perspectives of consumers and providers of primary health care, to develop an entertaining computer-supported patient decision aid (PtDA) for decision-making about CRC screening; and 2) Conduct a feasibility pilot study of the PtDA intervention in community health centers serving a large, primary care population with low health literacy. The Edutainment Decision Aid Model (EDAM), a framework for linking learning theory and entertainment education, will be used to guide development of the PtDA. The EDAM uses two integrated components to promote user engagement-soap opera scenes and interactive learning modules-integrated elements that engage the user in an interesting story while providing essential information about the choices and tools for clarifying values in making a decision. Two tracks will be developed, one where the main character is African American and a second where the main character is an English-speaking Hispanic patient. The feasibility study will be conducted in a sample of 100 African American and 100 English-speaking Hispanic primary care patients who are candidates for CRCS and are patients at a community health center located in Houston, Texas. Strategies for implementing the PtDA in busy clinical settings, patients' acceptance of the intervention, and refinement of process and outcome measures will be addressed in the feasibility study. A subsequent randomized trial will be planned to evaluate the PtDA in multiple clinical settings against an aid with the same content but lacking the entertainment component. A Spanish language track will also be developed for the subsequent trial. Death from colorectal cancer is preventable if the cancer is detected early. Screening rates for colorectal cancer are well below targets set by Health People 2010, particularly among African American and Hispanic patients. Educational interventions which rely on entertainment to engage patients in the content have great promise for increasing motivation and rates of completing colorectal cancer screening test.

"Colon cancer disparity elimination: a faith-based participatory partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elimination of the glaring colorectal cancer-related disparities in African Americans (AA) IS POSSIBLE. In this community based participatory research project (CPBR), we address both the SUPPLY and DEMAND components of the solution. Employing the community consultants and physicians successfully trained in Phase I, we have an adequate provider base to satisfy the increased demand resulting from this faith oriented barrier-free colonoscopy screening initiative. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is predominately preventable through screening for and removal of precancerous polyps. Unfortunately every year over 50,000 Americans of all races die unnecessarily. Multiple barriers result in an unacceptable disparity in both incidence and mortality for the AA, with the result that the death rate for AA males with advanced CRC cancer is double that for white males. The discovery of the evolution of CRC from benign polyps gives physicians ample time to remove the offending tissue prior to the development of cancers. The importance for screening in the AA population is accentuated by the documented shorter interval from the appearance of a polyp until its malignant transformation. We also know that colonoscopy is the ""gold standard."" The current capacity for performing colonoscopy is far below what is needed to screen the at-risk population as recent data reveals that only one-third of the appropriate population is compliant. In addition to capacity issues, many barriers to screening are patient related characteristics such as knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, cultural and ethnic issues, acceptability of screening method(s), ability to pay, and other socioeconomic and environmental issues (i.e. transportation, stigma, social support, etc.). Although over 80% of colonoscopies are provided by gastroenterologists, less than 4% in training are AA, fostering a growing gap in culturally competent colonoscopy providers. Using a triangulated theoretical framework including the Health Belief Model, the Social Cognitive Theory and the RE-AIM Evaluation model, we will further demonstrate a successful solution to addressing both SUPPLY (capacity for colorectal screening) and DEMAND (targeted patient access to and utilization of colorectal screening). The Phase I study confirmed that compliance can be achieved comparable to that for breast cancer screening (75%). The astounding high-rate of neoplasia (4%) emphasizes the critical importance of this endeavor.           ",Colon cancer disparity elimination: a faith-based participatory partnership,8022098,R24MD002812,"['Provider ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Endoscopy ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' P50 Program ', ' P50 Mechanism ', ' Specialized Center ', ' Monitor ', ' Evolution ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Gastroenterology ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Incidence ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Americas ', ' male ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Gastroenterologist ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' neoplasia ', ' Neoplasms ', ' Glare ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Polyps ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stigmata ', ' Solutions ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' South Carolina ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transportation ', ' Attitude ', ' Caucasians ', ' Hour ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Belief ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' outreach ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Appearance ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' County ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' outreach program ', ' phase I trial ', ' phase I protocol ', ' phase 1 trial ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' large intestine polyp ', ' large bowel polyp ', ' Colorectal Polyp ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' volunteer ', ' community based participatory research ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' ']",NIMHD,SOUTH CAROLINA HIV COUNCIL,R24,2009,540858,0.07109534291218422
"Tailored Interactive Multimedia to Reduce Colorectal CA Screening Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interactive multimedia computer programs (IMCPs) show promise as a way of delivering personally tailored (PT) information to enhance cognitive mediators of health behavior and improve patient outcomes. However, it is unclear whether PT IMCPs can be deployed in primary care offices to increase cancer screening uptake and eliminate ethnic disparities in uptake by providing PT information in each user's preferred language. Aims/Hypotheses: We will compare changes in CRC screening cognitive mediators (self- efficacy, perceived barriers, and readiness) and uptake resulting from an IMCP  PT to enhance the key cognitive mediators and targeted to patients' self-identified ethnicity - with changes resulting from a non- tailored ""electronic leaflet"" control IMCP. The experimental and control IMCPs will each be offered in English and Spanish versions. We hypothesize that, compared with the appropriate control condition (English, Spanish, or both combined): (1) the English version of the PT IMCP will enhance the cognitive mediators of CRC screening behavior for English-speaking Hispanics and non-Hispanics; (2) there will be similarly favorable changes in these mediators for Hispanics using the Spanish version of the PT IMCP; (3) deployment of the PT IMCP will provide evidence of elimination of disparities in CRC screening between Hispanic and non-Hispanic subjects via its relative impact on the cognitive mediators in these groups; and (4) the PT IMCP (English and Spanish combined) will increase CRC screening uptake in Hispanics and non-Hispanics (considered separately) via changes in the cognitive mediators. Methods: Randomized controlled trial of 2 groups, comparing a PT (to the cognitive mediators) CRC screening IMCP offered in both English and Spanish versions and deployed before a primary care office visit with a non-tailored ""electronic leaflet"" CRC screening IMCP (control) also offered in both English and Spanish. Screening methods targeted will be fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. Primary outcomes will be CRC screening uptake, self- efficacy, perceived barriers, and readiness. Implications: Our findings will determine whether an IMCP that is PT to cognitive mediators of screening behavior and deployed in primary care offices prior to previously scheduled visits can activate patients of various ethnicities to undergo CRC screening.

"PEER OUTREACH TO FACILITATE COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING IN SAFETY NET CLINICS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening is an effective tool for reducing both colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, but many adults are not screened at recommended intervals. Persons of low socioeconomic status or who are uninsured have disproportionately lower rates of screening and higher rates of CRC incidence and mortality. Novel strategies are needed for this population to increase awareness of CRC and facilitate screening attempts. The long-term objectives of this project are to develop effective, sustainable, and disseminable interventions that will increase CRC screening, decrease incidence, and improve survival in underserved populations. Such efforts are critical to decreasing the current health disparities in CRC and reducing overall CRC burden in the population. The Primary Aim in this application is to assess the promise of a peer-delivered outreach intervention for increasing decisions favoring, and completion of, CRC screening among patients from urban safety-net clinics. This randomized trial will test the effectiveness of a peer-delivered intervention compared to a traditional print-based intervention for promoting CRC screening. This study will be conducted with 200 patients who are between the ages of 50 and 75 and at average-risk for CRC. Patients will complete a baseline survey on-site at the safety-net clinic at the time of recruitment and will be randomized to either a ""peer coach"" or a comparison print intervention. Our theory-based intervention incorporates constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior and Implementation Intentions Theory. Peer Coaches are community members who are employed by the clinic and trained to help patients access healthcare. The intervention will consist of three outreach counseling calls to promote and facilitate CRC screening. The comparison print intervention will consist of three mailings with targeted information about CRC screening. We will conduct a follow-up telephone survey of participants at 6-months post baseline. The primary outcome of this study is completion of any acceptable CRC screen (FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy) at six-months after baseline, measured by chart review. A secondary aim is to conduct process evaluation and demonstrate feasibility for intervening in safety-net settings. Successful completion of this R21 will inform the development of a planned full-scale R01 intervention trial to reduce disparities in CRC screening, incidence, and survival. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with better survival, but population screening rates are relatively low, especially so in low income and uninsured persons. Our study will examine the effect of an intervention using peer coaches to increase CRC screening rates in safety-net clinics. Increases in screening can have a significant impact on CRC burden in the United States.           Project Narrative Early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with better survival, but population screening rates are relatively low, especially so in low income and uninsured persons.

"Cancer Control Dissemination to Asian Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of our proposal is to disseminate an evidence-based intervention designed for one Asian ethnic population to a different Asian ethnic population with overlapping cultural and health beliefs. In collaboration with International Community Health Services (ICHS), a community agency serving many Asian ethnic groups, we have three specific objectives for the proposed research:  Replicate an effective colorectal cancer (CRC) screening intervention for Vietnamese Americans that was originally designed for Chinese Americans.  Evaluate the dissemination of this replicated intervention through a quasi-experimental study.  Collect and examine dissemination process data. Based on principles from Diffusion of Innovation Theory, we proposed to replicate an intervention with a 42% effect size. The replicated intervention will consist of a Vietnamese language video and bilingual pamphlet. We will translate and dub into Vietnamese our award-winning Chinese-language video, ""Being a Winner in Life: How to Prevent Colorectal Cancer."" The Chinese/English pamphlet will also be translated into Vietnamese. To provide feedback on the translated video script and pamphlet, we will convene 4 focus groups with Vietnamese men and women. Subsequently, we will introduce these materials to the intervention clinic staff at in-service training presentations and specifically recommend that intervention clinic medical assistants distribute the intervention materials. To evaluate the dissemination of this replicated intervention, our quantitative analysis will examine the Reach and Effectiveness based on the RE-AIM framework through a quasi-experimental study over an 18-month period. There are 919 and 802 age-eligible Vietnamese patients at the intervention and control clinic respectively. To determine the Effectiveness of the intervention, the primary outcome will be changes in CRC screening adherence rates at the intervention and control clinics. We will randomly select 25% of the patients from each clinic for pre- and post-intervention chart audits and use the Generalized Estimating Equation to model CRC screening adherence at the two clinics at pre- and post-intervention. Process evaluation will examine Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance at the intervention clinic. We will collect qualitative data from 10 key informant interviews with ICHS management personnel and intervention clinic staff. In addition, 3 focus groups with medical assistants, the intervention agents, anof two focus groups with Vietnamese patients at the intervention clinic will also be completed.           ",Cancer Control Dissemination to Asian Americans,7879491,R01CA124397,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' computerized data processing ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' International ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' informant ', ' Feedback ', ' Adoption ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medical ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Japan ', ' Korea ', ' Language ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' post intervention ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Funding ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Personnel Management ', ' Philosophy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Translating ', ' Vietnam ', ' Viet Nam ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Reporting ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' Chinese American ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Services ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' population health ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2010,1,0.14292404996716015
"Investigating the role of mutation sequence and microRNAs in colorectal cancer de    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well established that genetic and epigenetic alterations play important roles in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). A major challenge to our understanding of how this process occurs is to understand how these genetic and epigenetic changes work pathologically to allow for uncontrolled cancer cell growth. Until now, the systematic dissection of the signaling pathways and genes that control CRC initiation and progression have been limited by the use of primary human tumor samples, lack of suitable long-term culture systems, and mouse models that do not accurately recapitulate this process. The recent development of a robust long-term primary colonic epithelium culture system by our group that is capable of modeling tumorigenesis affords the opportunity to begin to explore the role of differential sequence of oncogene and tumor suppressor gene activation or inactivation, respectively, and the functional evaluation of CRC-upregulated or downregulated microRNAs in the development of CRC. Specifically, this proposal seeks to address the hypothesis that the sequence in which one acquires genetic alterations alters CRC progression, and possibly clinical outcomes. Likewise, this proposal seeks to functionally validate the role of microRNAs that are differentially expressed in CRC vs. normal human colonic epithelium. The studies proposed herein will facilitate our fundamental understanding of colon cancer initiation and progression, allowing for the development of more efficacious and targeted approaches to therapy.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal Cancer is a diverse and heterogeneous disease that is caused by the progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations. Health disparities and diverse clinical outcomes can be partially attributed to the specific genetic alteration that occurs within a specific tumor. Understanding how alterations in gene function, or the sequence in which one acquires them, and how changes in microRNA expression contribute to colorectal cancer development will provide novel insights that will contribute to our ability to develop better treatments, therapies, and/or diagnostic tools.           Project Narrative Colorectal Cancer is a diverse and heterogeneous disease that is caused by the progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations.

"Colorectal Cancer Education and Screening Program (CCESP)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is an essential component to the reduction of cancer health disparities. By using CBPR with community partners, we will increase colorectal cancer screening in underserved areas. In order to increase screening, we plan to provide education and screening for Arkansans in two underserved counties in the Arkansas Delta, specifically Northeast (Mississippi County) and Southeast (St. Francis County). Both education and provision of FOBT kits with reminders are proven means of increasing screening rates. A combination of the two has not been investigated to determine if screening rates can be further improved. Based on this, we hypothesize that a CBPR intervention providing education, awareness and FOBT screening tests in two underserved communities will Increase screening uptake rates above either treatment alone or control. We will test the hypothesis through the following Specific Aims:      Specific Aim 1: Implement standard, culturally tailored, and no treatment control co-developed interventions for colorectal cancer screening in collaboration with community partners to increase uptake of colorectal screening via FOBT screening techniques.   Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy of the standard and culturally tailored screening interventions (treatment arms) on uptake of colorectal cancer screening compared to the no treatment control arm and to each other   Specific Aim 3: Develop a dissemination plan of preliminary findings to distribute to community partners and research community as they become available.      Upon completion of the CBPR intervention, the collaboration of community partners and academicians will result in reduction of CRC disparities through education, increased knowledge, and screening. Our novel approach partners academia with the community in all aspects of a CBPR study evaluating a previously unexplored combination of education and provision of FOBT cards and reminders to increase colorectal cancer screening. Further, this study will allow us to better understand factors influencing cancer screening uptake. Future studies will include the full dissemination of findings of this study and further refinement of tailored screening interventions to address various cancer disparities.          ",Colorectal Cancer Education and Screening Program (CCESP),7799116,R24MD002805,"['Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' Mississippi ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Patients ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Arkansas ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Universities ', ' Awareness ', ' Techniques ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' County ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' community setting ', ' arm ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Caring ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Progress Review Group ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Adoption ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' minority health ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R24,2010,478402,0.11527707826925021
"CBPR Strategies to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Ohio Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): a disproportionate burden of CRC incidence and mortality, mainly due to lower utilization of recommended CRC screening tests. The Appalachian region of Ohio suffers from this burden of disease in addition to higher poverty, lower employment, and lower educational levels. To address this cancer health disparity, our health disparities research team at The Ohio State University (OSU) in partnership with four Appalachia-based community coalitions have used community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods to design and pilot test two interventions intended to increase CRC screening rates in one Appalachian county (Phase 1).  The goal of this application is to test these CRC screening interventions in 12 Ohio Appalachian counties (Phase 2) in preparation for a full-scale dissemination trial (Phase 3) in 6 additional Appalachian states within the Appalachia Community Cancer Network (ACCN).      The specific aims of this Phase 2 proposal are to: 1) utilize CBPR methods to refine specific county-level media campaigns and clinic-based messages about CRC screening (entitled ""Get Behind Your Health!"") or an attention control message (a healthy eating campaign entitled ""PEACHES"") in 12 Ohio Appalachia counties; 2) implement and test, using a group-randomized design, a staggered county-wide intervention program that compares county-specific media campaigns featuring local CRC survivors, clinic-specific charter reminder systems, and a combination of the two strategies in 6 randomly selected intervention counties to the same campaign strategies in 6 randomly selected attention control counties using county specific healthy eating campaigns featuring local farmers and educational material placed in clinics; 3) utilize process (convenience samples of county residents) and outcome evaluation (4 independent cross-sectional surveys of residents of each county) strategies to assess the efficacy of each strategy on improving CRC screening rates; and 4) utilize the results, to plan the dissemination of the intervention into 36 Appalachian counties in 6 additional states of the ACCN in a subsequent Phase 3 study.      All specific aims will be carried out using CBPR principles, in full partnership with these four Ohio Appalachian community-based cancer coalitions, and will be guided by an underlying theoretical framework of the Transtheoretical Model, in conjunction with three behavioral theories relevant to behavior change (Social Cognitive Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action, and Attitude Accessibility Theory).  The results of this study, thus, will have immediate impact in these Appalachian counties, as the community will be able to institutionalize successful strategies into existing county-wide health campaigns.          ",CBPR Strategies to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Ohio Appalachia,7792363,R24MD002785,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Employment ', ' Address ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Phase ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Incidence ', ' Evaluation ', ' farmer ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Ohio ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' intervention program ', ' Media Campaign ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Modality ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' County ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' dissemination trial ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' phase 3 study ', ' Phase III study ', ' ']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2010,583461,0.18648440451113946
"Molecular Genetics of Colorectal Cancer Progression in a Diverse Patient Cohort    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of new cancer cases and cancer deaths in the United States. A pronounced disparity exists between African American and Caucasian American patients, with African Americans displaying both increased incidence and mortality rates. Although many factors play a role in this health disparity, several findings also suggest a role for tumor biology and genetics. MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 are proteins expressed by mismatch repair genes that are responsible for repairing nucleotide mispairs and small insertions or deletions caused by the DNA replication machinery. Prior studies have revealed that African Americans display a younger age at presentation, a higher incidence of proximal- located tumors and a higher prevalence of the microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, a phenotype commonly observed in Lynch Syndrome patients (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) and associated with loss of function of the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins. Based upon these findings, I hypothesize that increased alteration of mismatch repair genes in African American patients may account for the higher incidence of MSI-H tumors and, further, that both the frequency and spectrum of mismatch repair gene alterations may be distinct in African American patients. To evaluate this hypothesis, Brooke Sylvester proposes the following aims: aim 1) to analyze a cohort of colorectal cancer patients to determine if demographic factors correlate with tumor pathology, microsatellite instability status and survival, using immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue microarrays and microsatellite instability testing; aim 2) to compare the mutation spectrum and mutation or promoter hypermethylation frequency of mismatch repair genes in our patient population with those previously reported in other populations, using publicly available datasets; aim 3) to determine whether mismatch repair proteins play a role in the DNA damage-induced apoptotic response, utilizing RNA interference techniques to silence the expression of mismatch repair genes. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the molecular mechanisms leading to the distinct phenotype observed in African American colorectal cancer patients and how this may affect colorectal cancer progression. If this phenomenon plays a role in the increased incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer in African American patients, then this study will be relevant in identifying therapies that will reduce or eliminate the unequal burden of cancer in our society.             ",Molecular Genetics of Colorectal Cancer Progression in a Diverse Patient Cohort,7749526,F31CA136237,"['American ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA biosynthesis ', ' DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA Replication ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Chicago ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' MSH2 gene ', ' MSH2 ', ' FCC1 ', ' COCA1 ', ' MLH1 gene ', ' hMLH1 ', ' MLH1 ', ' MGC5172 ', ' FCC2 ', ' COCA2 ', ' PMS2 gene ', ' PMSL2 ', ' PMS2 ', ' H_DJ0042M02.9 ', ' HNPCC4 ', ' DNA Mismatch Repair Gene Homologue ', ' MSH6 gene ', ' MSH6 ', ' HNPCC5 ', ' Microsatellite Instability ', ' Accounting ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ', ' Lynch Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, hPMS2) ', ' Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Defective Mismatch Repair Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Colorectal Endometrial Cancer Syndrome ', ' Familial Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Familial Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, hPMS2) ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' Population ', ' loss of function ', ' tumor ', ' patient population ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencings ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencings ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencings ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Mismatch Repair ', ' Post-Replication Mismatch Repair ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' protein expression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Defect ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Hypermethylation ', ' Mutation Spectra ', ' Apoptotic ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Tumor Pathology ', ' Molecular ', ' Exhibits ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' Goals ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Incidence ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Cytotoxic agent ', ' Cytotoxic drug ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Caucasians ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Medical center ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2010,33484,0.09898273435373595
"Neighborhood Effects on Colorectal Cancer Incidence and Stage of Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary The proposed project is a longitudinal, observational study incorporating both area and individual level variables to assess contextual effects of the neighborhood on colorectal cancer incidence and stage of diagnosis. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second highest cause of cancer related deaths in the US. Minority populations are disproportionately affected and are known to have adverse outcomes. Although screening guidelines exist, a large proportion of cases are still being diagnosed at late stages. Since CRC has a long latency period, exposure to a deleterious social environment along with other risk factors portend poor prognosis. For this study, a conceptual model depicting the varying levels of exposure to risk factors, in multiple domains, with differing pathways in access to resources, resulting in a certain level of community health was adapted for use. In addition, secondary analysis of Cancer Registry and Census data circumvents the prohibitive costs of primary data collection, particularly for small research projects. The specific aims of this multilevel and ecological study are to examine relationships between contextual variables and the cases of CRC at block group and census tract level, early/late stage diagnosis at multiple levels simultaneously and also to examine the geographic variation in spatial and temporal trends in CRC incidence and late stage diagnosis for the years 1998-2003 in Houston, using Poisson models in SaTScan. Census derived readily available social environment variables such as occupational class, education level, poverty, overcrowding, linguistic isolation etc. will be the independent variables. CRC cases and early/late stage diagnosis will be analyzed as the dependent variables.  Addressing disparities in cancer etiology is a high priority area for National Institute of Health and National Cancer Institute and secondary analysis of existing datasets is an important requirement of the R03 mechanism and the program announcement. As the local health department in the fourth largest city in the country, we are responsible for identifying geographic areas of need and lack of access to resources and developing appropriate intervention strategies to address them. We anticipate that our results will be easily translatable to other large cities, similar to ours, with diverse populations. This study will help us better understand cancer disparities and tease out the socio-environmental factors that play a role in adverse outcomes using ecological, multilevel and geospatial analytic techniques.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative  Public Health Relevance: Our study will result in greater understanding of the distribution, etiology, spatio-temporal patterns of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Houston, the fourth largest city in the country. It will also identify areas of the city with greater than expected rates. This will help ascertain important social, environmental and behavioral risk factors that play a role in late stage diagnosis of this disease. This study will not only help inform science, but also community health professionals in designing programs to address some of the modifiable factors, in settings similar to ours. In addition, the policy implications at various levels of the government such as the City and State level and translation of research into practice by enhancing health promotion, health literacy and CRC screening in high risk areas are some of the potential benefits that will be achieved.           Project Narrative  Public Health Relevance: Our study will result in greater understanding of the distribution, etiology, spatio-temporal patterns of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Houston, the fourth largest city in the country.

"Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. We will use the Pathways Framework, Community-Based Participatory Research process, and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to guide our approach to the intervention, community participation, and dissemination. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a CRC LHW + Media intervention in increasing CRC screening among Vietnamese Americans aged 50 to 74 who have never had a CRC screening test, 2) identify predictors of CRC screening, and 3) evaluate the process of community participation. Following formative research using a cognitive testing approach to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials and survey instruments, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial among Vietnamese Americans aged 50-74 in Santa Clara County California, who have never had a CRC screening test prior to recruitment. We will follow two longitudinal cohorts among whom we will conduct a pre-intervention survey of participants' knowledge, intention, and behavior as regards CRC screening; implement CRC screening educational sessions in an experimental group and nutrition educational sessions in a comparison group; and conduct a post-intervention survey. Each of the two cohorts will include 150 men and 150 women to have a total sample size of 600. The media intervention component will distribute Vietnamese-language health education materials through print and electronic media. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the frequency of screening using pre- and post-intervention surveys. To test our primary hypothesis regarding the effects of the intervention on screening activity, we will use Z-tests. We will also employ logistic regression models to test the effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for CRC screening. In addition, we will conduct process evaluation of the intervention and community participation. If this intervention is found to be effective, this LHW model could be applied in health promotion programs to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans and evaluated in other behavioral objectives and settings to reduce health disparities in other poor and underserved populations. Public Health Relevance: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Relative to non-Hispanic whites, Vietnamese Americans are both poorer and less well medically served and have special language and cultural issues related to cancer screening that cannot be addressed though interventions aimed at the general population. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. If this intervention is found to be effective, it could be applied in other health promotion programs throughout the United States  to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans. In addition, this LHW model could be evaluated in other populations, such as other racial and ethnic, poor, or immigrant communities; in other behavioral objectives, such as other forms of cancer, cardiovascular health, or tobacco, diabetes and obesity control; and in other settings, such as community health clinics and hospitals.",Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans,7766896,R01CA132660,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Electronics ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Media Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Female ', ' Intention ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Phase ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Israel ', ' Language ', ' insight ', ' post intervention ', ' Sample Size ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Immigrant ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Printing ', ' Research ', ' Sigmoidoscopy ', ' Proctosigmoidoscopy ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Adopted ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' Birds ', ' Avian ', ' Aves ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' Familiarity ', ' Breast ', ' California ', ' Participant ', ' Media Campaign ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' comparison group ', ' community intervention ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R01,2010,577046,0.29625565570147416
"Tailored Navigation in CRC Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project represents an exciting opportunity to engage older urban African Americans in a comparative effectiveness study of methods to increase CRC screening. African American participants represent only about 25% of study participants in the parent study. As a result, we will not be able to determine the impact of different intervention methods in this high-risk group. Determining how to increase CRC screening among African Americans will help to reduce disparities in disease incidence and mortality. In this competitive revision, the patient population for the study will be drawn from Einstein Health System primary care practices in Philadelphia that serve a predominantly African American patient population. Using a two-group randomized design, we will randomly assign consenting participants who complete a baseline telephone survey (N=472) to either a Standard Intervention (SI) Group (N=236) or an Enhanced Tailored Navigation Intervention (E-TNI) Group (N=236). SI Group participants will receive a generic mailed intervention that encourages CRC screening. E-TNI Group participants will receive a mailed intervention that is culturally-targeted to African Americans, telephone contacts, and electronic communications intended to encourage CRC screening. Specific aims of the study, in order of priority, are to determine (1) E-TNI impact on CRC screening utilization, (2) E-TNI impact on CRC screening preference, and (3) E-TNI impact on perceptions about CRC screening. We hypothesize that the E-TNI Group will have significantly higher CRC screening use, increased preference for CRC screening, and more favorable perceptions about CRC screening than the SI Group. Data obtained from an endpoint survey and an endpoint chart audit will be used to assess study group differences.

"Doctor-Patient Communication about Colorectal Cancer Screening and Health Dispari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this career development application is to launch an independent research program in cancer prevention and control with specific expertise in improving clinician-patient communication in underserved populations. Recent attention has been paid to the vital role of communication in clinical encounters and its effect on patient outcomes. In general, this research has not taken place with underserved populations, although patients in underserved populations have higher levels of mistrust of their clinicians, report lower levels of satisfaction with the encounter, and have poorer adherence. Given the import of clinician-patient communication and the emerging evidence about the effectiveness of interventions to improve clinician-patient communication, a more sophisticated understanding of communication between doctors and underserved patients and its impact on patient outcomes is required. Learning objectives for this career award include: 1) gain an increased understanding of the factors influencing health disparities in order to better plan studies and interpret results; 2) obtain a working knowledge of cancer epidemiology to inform my selection of outcome measures; 3) learn core principles for developing community interventions to change health behavior; 4) develop working relationships with researchers in health disparities through conference attendance and networking; 5) explore the communication between providers and low-income, minority patients with a focus on adherence to CRC screening; and 6) use a community-based participatory approach to obtain stakeholders' opinions about feasibility and acceptability of doctor-focused communication training interventions. Colorectal cancer screening will provide the paradigm for study in this application because of the disparities in both screening and cancer incidence by race, income, and education. The in-depth study of the effect of doctor-patient discussions about cancer screening will provide the opportunity to explore unique challenges faced in clinician-patient communication in underserved populations. Ultimately, this work will lead to the development of interventions to improve communication in these settings. Through intensive interaction with mentors and multi- disciplinary colleagues within a well-resourced institutional environment, formal coursework and educational activities, and the proposed research, this award will prepare me for a career as an independent researcher in doctor-patient communication and health disparities.           Project Narrative Doctor-patient communication plays a key role in improving adherence to colorectal cancer screening.

"African American Multi-construct Survey of Cultural Attitudes Relevant to Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal of Healthy People 2010 is the elimination of health disparities. The Institute of Medicine and the National Cancer Institute have suggested cultural appropriateness of education materials and interventions as one strategy to reduce disparities. With few exceptions, rates of incidence and mortality are higher and 5-year survival lower among African American men and women than Whites for the leading causes of cancer death. Researchers have recognized that behavior, including those relevant to cancer prevention and control, occurs in a social context. Thus, an understanding of which social and cultural constructs are related to cancer screening and how seems appropriate. Measurement of behavioral and social science constructs requires that we be able to make distinctions among constructs, as well as dimensions of constructs with reasonable accuracy. A review of the current literature highlights concerns related to the measurement of cultural constructs, including strategies for operationalizing constructs, the variety of measures, psychometric properties of current measures, and difficulties studying constructs, and their relevant dimensions simultaneously rather than individually. This state of affairs limits our ability to determine the relative importance of cultural attitudes and norms for cancer prevention and control activities. To further knowledge in this area it is important that commonly accepted measures of the identified variables exist so that work from various studies can be easily compared. We propose to develop a measure of socio-cultural attitudes that taps the cultural values linked to cancer screening behaviors in the African American community. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer among African American men and women and has an authoritative set of screening guidelines; thus, we have selected colorectal cancer screening as our focus. The African American Multi-Construct Survey of Cultural Attitudes will provide an easily administered measure of cultural variables. We will use item response theory (IRT) to simultaneously development long, short and computer-adapted versions of an instrument capable of allowing quick, accurate assessment of multiple cultural constructs. At the end of this project, we will provide data on the computer adapted test of cultural constructs and their relevance to colorectal cancer screening behaviors among African Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will yield a core set of valid and reliable survey items that can improve the measurement of culture in cancer research, facilitate comparisons and minimize the redundancy of effort across research projects. This study also provides data on the relationship between cultural constructs and CRC cancer screening attitudes and behaviors. This information will be used in developing health education and promotion materials and interventions that more effectively target the African American community.          ",African American Multi-construct Survey of Cultural Attitudes Relevant to Cancer,7880708,R01CA122435,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' Health Promotion and Education ', ' Health Promotion and Training ', ' Health Promotion and Instruction ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cognitive ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Comprehension ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Guidelines ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Physical activity ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Literature ', ' Measurement ', ' Saints ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Perception ', ' Personnel Management ', ' tool ', ' Psychometrics ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Adopted ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' Participant ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' cultural values ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' behavioral health ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health research ', ' Computers ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,365225,0.1344895052397508
"Understanding Racial and Ethnic Differences in Survival from Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancers are the third most common invasive cancers among men and women in the United States. Improvements in prevention, screening and treatment have resulted in decreasing case-fatality rates from colorectal cancer since the 1980s. Paradoxically, disparities in survival from this cancer especially between Blacks and Whites have widened over time. Although there is no consensus in existing literature, current evidence suggests that factors related to access to health care including socioeconomic differences contribute to these disparities. The goal of the proposed research program is to identify potentially modifiable causes of disparities in cancer survival with a long range goal of reducing or eliminating the disproportionate burden of colorectal cancer among certain patient populations. The specific aims for this project are to: 1) compare colorectal cancer survival rates by race/ethnicity over the period 1993 through 2004; 2) compare the distribution of tumor stage at diagnosis for colorectal cancer by race/ethnicity; 3) examine potential mediators of the relationship of survival and race/ethnicity among colorectal cancer patients; 4) examine the patterns of care of survivors of colorectal cancer; and 5) explore the effect of socioeconomic status on the relationship between race/ethnicity and survival among colorectal cancer patients. This project will be conducted on a large racially diverse cohort comprised of patients 20 years and older diagnosed with colorectal cancer (1993 to 2004) while enrolled in one of four integrated health care systems that are affiliated with the National Cancer Institute-funded Cancer Research Network. This research plan is part of a career development program aimed at providing the training and experience needed for Dr. Doubeni to become an independently funded clinician-investigator focusing on disparities in cancer survival. The objectives of the career development plan are to acquire knowledge and skills in: 1) cancer biology, epidemiology and treatment; 2) advanced research methods; 3) scientific writing; and 4) the translation of research into practice and policy. The career development program will be accomplished through mentoring and targeted advanced courses. The studies encompassed under the proposed research program will make important contributions to our understanding of racial/ethnic differences in cancer survival rates. The proposed project will lay the foundation for the candidate's long-term career goal of designing system-based interventions aimed at eliminating disparities in cancer care and survival, a major objective of HealthyPeople 2010.          ",Understanding Racial and Ethnic Differences in Survival from Colorectal Cancer,7917315,K01CA127118,"['Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Survivors ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' patient population ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Tumor stage ', ' T-Stage ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Caring ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Research Network ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Foundations ', ' base ', ' career ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K01,2010,141539,0.1517192577714638
"Promoting Health Literacy for Colorectal Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term goal of this project is to decrease colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality through encouraging informed decision making about routine CRC screening (CRCS). National data indicate that current rates of CRC screening do not approach Health People 2010 targets. There is evidence that low health literacy adversely impacts access to care and receipt of preventive health care services including cancer screening. This exploratory/developmental research grant (R21), titled ""Promoting Health Literacy for Colorectal Cancer Screening,"" will use an entertainment education approach to promote informed decision making about CRCS among men and women with low health literacy, who are presenting for health care in urban community health centers. Entertainment education is the process of purposely designing and implementing media that incorporate educational messages in an entertaining format, and is a promising strategy for communicating health information to patients with low health literacy. The specific aims of this project are as follows: 1) Use a participatory research approach, representing the perspectives of consumers and providers of primary health care, to develop an entertaining computer-supported patient decision aid (PtDA) for decision-making about CRC screening; and 2) Conduct a feasibility pilot study of the PtDA intervention in community health centers serving a large, primary care population with low health literacy. The Edutainment Decision Aid Model (EDAM), a framework for linking learning theory and entertainment education, will be used to guide development of the PtDA. The EDAM uses two integrated components to promote user engagement-soap opera scenes and interactive learning modules-integrated elements that engage the user in an interesting story while providing essential information about the choices and tools for clarifying values in making a decision. Two tracks will be developed, one where the main character is African American and a second where the main character is an English-speaking Hispanic patient. The feasibility study will be conducted in a sample of 100 African American and 100 English-speaking Hispanic primary care patients who are candidates for CRCS and are patients at a community health center located in Houston, Texas. Strategies for implementing the PtDA in busy clinical settings, patients' acceptance of the intervention, and refinement of process and outcome measures will be addressed in the feasibility study.

"A Population Based Policy Model for Colorectal Cancer In the first CISNET project we developed a population-based Monte Carlo simulation model that evaluates  national trends in the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). The HSPH-CISNET Model  incorporates age-, sex-, and race-specific trends in CRC risk factors, screening, and treatment, as well as  the effects of risk factors and screening on the underlying natural history of colorectal disease and the  effectiveness of treatment for patients with diagnosed CRC. The Model currently simulates the US  population aged 25 years and older from 1970 to 2020. We have used the Model to examine the relative  contribution of changes in risk factors, screening, and treatment to the overall population trends in CRC  incidence and mortality.  The purpose of this project is to use the HSPH-CISNET Model to evaluate the population impact of existing  cancer control strategies, as well as the impact of strategies on the horizon. Of particular importance is to  incorporate the associations between risk factors and screening trends, and to determine the potential  impact of disparities in CRC risk and mortality at a population level. Other aims will focus on evaluating the  population-level impact of specific risk factor trends, screening modalities, and treatment advancements.  To validate our modeling assumptions, we will use our model structure to simulate the population of  Norway, a country that does not have a CRC screening program, in an attempt to re-create their incidence  and mortality statistics. We will continue to collaborate with other modeling groups, as well as with the new  CRC Coordinating Center and the NCI to focus on questions that apply across all modeling groups. In  addition, we propose a concrete plan for making our model more accessible to outside collaborators. This  plan involves posting the model structure on a public website, sharing code with established outside  investigators, and providing the necessary model support.

"Colorectal Cancer Screening in a Diverse Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am a primary care physician and researcher, who is committed to understanding and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in cancer.  If granted this award, I will build upon my Master's in Public Health degree and my prior research experience to advance my knowledge and skills through coursework, mentored research, apprentice-style learning and semi-structured training.  The University of Texas Medical Branch is especially committed to improving the health of the diverse and underserved local populations we serve, through high quality patient care and ongoing research and is very supportive of my career development plan.  I have integrated the coursework and research activities so that I can achieve my objectives.  The long-term objective of the proposed research is to explain and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in colorectal cancer disease burden.  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the USA, accounting for ten percent of all cancer deaths.  As with other cancers, African Americans carry an unequal burden from this disease, they have the highest incidence and mortality of all racial/ethnic groups.  There is now good evidence that screening for colorectal cancer reduces mortality from this disease and currently five screening options are recommended.  However, national self-reported screening data suggests that screening levels are poor, especially in minority groups.  The higher mortality in African Americans is thought to be due in part to their higher incidence and in part due to their lower screening rates.  The research in this plan will address this underutilization of screening about which many unanswered questions remain: there is uncertainty about the accuracy of self-reported screening data, especially in minority patients, and there remains a lack of understanding as to the mechanisms through which race/ethnicity affects screening behavior both for African Americans and Hispanics.  In order to address these issues, we plan a series of related aims in a population of African American, Hispanic and Non-Hispanic white patients.  We propose a cross-sectional study utilizing a survey instrument that will be developed especially for use in our racial/ethnically diverse population.  The purpose of the first aim of our study is to determine the prevalence of age and risk appropriate screening in our patient population.  The second aim will determine the accuracy of self-reported information by comparing patient responses to medical record information.  The third aim will examine the mechanisms through which a person's race/ethnicity determines their colorectal cancer screening behavior; we will examine how patient factors, health care system factors and patients' interactions with their environment correlate with self-reported screening behavior.  The fourth aim will involve describing patient preferences for the array of CRC screening tests and systematically evaluating other influences on CRC screening such as health care delivery systems and physician factors and finally integrating all this information to design an intervention to increase CRC screening in all groups and to submit it for an R01 application prior to the end of the award.               ",Colorectal Cancer Screening in a Diverse Population,7896448,K07CA107052,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Commit ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Affect ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Age ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Incidence ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Research Activity ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentors ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' instrument ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Universities ', ' Clinic ', ' Award ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Accounting ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' billing data ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' patient population ', ' ']",NCI,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIS CENTER,K07,2010,124337,0.24871448739205412
"A Physician-Based Trial to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Chinese    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and the third leading cause of cancer death among Chinese Americans, the largest sub-group of Asian American and Pacific Islanders. Older Chinese Americans, who are mostly immigrants, face unique cultural barriers to screening and have among the lowest CRC screening rates in the US. Physician recommendation is the most important determinant of ZRC screening in older Chinese. Unfortunately, Chinese seeking care from Chinese-speaking physicians eceive CRC screening recommendations less often than those seeing English-speaking providers. We have assembled an experienced interdisciplinary, multi-cultural, bilingual team to conduct community primary care-based research guided by the Social Cognitive Theory with Chinese physicians and their Chinese patients in the Washington DC and the Philadelphia areas. The specific aims are to develop an intervention to mprove Chinese physicians' skills in culturally appropriate communication about CRC through observational earning, and conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of this physician-based intervention on CRC screening rates among their asymptomatic Chinese-American patients ages 50 and older who are non-adherent to screening. There are more than 110 Chinese physicians in our area. We have conducted formative work with 54 Chinese American primary care physicians (PCP's) to understand their barriers to CRC screening. Results from this formative work have been used to inform the intervention. Thirty Chinese PCP's will be randomized to the intervention or the usual care group. Physicians in the intervention group will receive (1) mailed culturally appropriate educational materials on CRC screening and communication skills, tool kits for identifying patient barriers, and examples of tracking systems for screening and (2) two sessions of in-office training with standardized Chinese patients to increase skills and self-efficacy for making screening recommendations. We will also audio-tape a sample of encounters to understand actual communication about CRC screening. Preliminary results from an NCI-funded pilot study awarded since the last submission show that the mailed materials and in-office training are feasible and acceptable to Chinese physicians. The main outcome will be CRC screening rates of 600 non-adherent Chinese American patients aged 50 and older (20 per physician) one year post-intervention. This research is consistent with the NCI's plan to reduce cancer health disparities in minority groups via new intervention research to identify and successfully overcome sociocultural and health system barriers to cancer screening. The proposed research will be the first study to use a culturally appropriate, theoretically-grounded physician intervention to improve CRC screening rates in Chinese Americans. If effective, this intervention will be highly transportable and have broad reach to physician audiences and increase screening in the growing Chinese population. This approach should also be broadly portable to developing culturally appropriate primary care cancer control interventions in other minority groups.                 ",A Physician-Based Trial to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Chinese,7881802,R01CA121023,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Effectiveness of Screening Colonoscopy in Reducing Deaths from Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers of the colon and rectum (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the US, can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques. Although some expert groups in the US consider colonoscopy to be the standard, there is currently only limited direct evidence to support its increasing use for screening in average risk adults. Colonoscopy has higher risks and costs than other screening tests. Recent studies reported that colonoscopy did not reduce mortality from right-sided colon cancers, the part of the colon that is beyond the reach of sigmoidoscopy. However, those findings were controversial because that study was unable to distinguish screening from diagnostic uses or accurately assess the completeness of colonoscopies. This project's goal is to inform clinical and policy decisions by providing evidence to show whether the purported benefits of colonoscopy are realized in practice. The primary specific aim is to estimate the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy in reducing death from CRC among average-risk adults when compared to no screening, overall and separately for right- and left-sided cancers. Our secondary aims are to: 1) determine the impact of the completeness of colonoscopy examinations on its effectiveness; and 2) compare the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy relative to sigmoidoscopy. We will use a case-control design nested in an historical cohort of persons receiving care at 3 sites participating in a research consortium, Cancer Research Network (CRN). These sites provide the full continuum of cancer care to their members ranging from screening through end of life care, and provide access to information on CRC screening that can be linked to diagnosis and cause-specific mortality data on large numbers of racially and socioeconomically diverse persons. We will identify at least 1,200 cases of CRC deaths between 2007 and 2014 among enrollees who were 52 years or older at the date of the diagnosis, each matched within each health plan to two randomly selected controls based on age, sex and enrollment history. We will identify screening history for a minimum of 10 years prior to cancer diagnosis, differentiating screening from diagnostic procedures, using standardized targeted chart reviews and other sources. The sample size will provide sufficient power for separate evaluations of tumors located in the right colon. This project will be carried out by an experienced interdisciplinary team representing epidemiology, case-control methodology, biostatistics, gastroenterology and primary care. Team members are national leaders in CRC screening research and policy. This project is in synergy with existing NCI and the CRN goals to: 1) develop methods and approaches to provide clinical, policy-relevant information; and 2) inform clinical and public health decisions on CRC screening. This application is also responsive to the NCI's priority to improve understanding of the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of tests used in screening for CRC, a ""health disparity condition"", and addresses Healthy People 2010 goals to reduce cancer death.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, but many of these cancers can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques.

"Patient Navigation for CRC Screening with Low-Income Minorities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal Cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates are highest in African Americans (AA's) compared with all other ethnic groups. One factor that may contribute to this trend is the lower rate of participation in CRC screening among AAs, which is critical to the prevention and early detection of CRC. Recent data indicate that the removal of precancerous polyps (via colonoscopy) decreases CRC incidence by 75-90 percent. Despite the implementation of national policy changes to increase CRC screening (through Medicaid/Medicare reimbursement for CRC screening and easier ""open"" access to colonoscopy) adherence remains alarmingly low. Our preliminary data show that, even after implementation of standard patient navigation (SPN) (i.e., assisting patients with making/keeping their appointments), only 40 percent of low-income minorities followed-through on their physician recommendation. Guided by Cognitive-Behavioral Social Learning Theory as a conceptual framework and cultural targeting as an intervention strategy, the proposed randomized clinical trial will investigate integrating within SPN a targeted discussion of intrapersonal and cultural barriers to colonoscopy (i.e., fear, lack of knowledge, medical mistrust, fatalism and fear) prevalent with low-income AAs. Based on research on source credibility and reference group-based social identity theory, we will also explore navigator status as a peer on the impact of culturally targeted PN. Thus, we will compare three PN strategies: SPN carried out by a professional navigator, Culturally Targeted PN carried out by a professional (CTPN-Pro) and Culturally Targeted PN carried out by a peer who has undergone colonoscopy (CTPN-Peer). Specific Aims: Aim 1: Compare the efficacy of SPN, CTPN-Pro, and CTPN-Peer on adherence to colonoscopy CRC screening in average risk, low-income AAs who have a primary care physician referral for colonoscopy. Aim 2: Explore potential mechanisms (i.e., mediators) underlying the beneficial effects of CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer and to examine for whom the CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer are most effective (i.e., moderators). Aim 3: Compare the cost effectiveness of CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer. Cost effectiveness will be examined in terms of direct clinical costs of screening (i.e., savings associated with more efficient use of personnel, space, and equipment) and patient costs (i.e., costs of CRC treatment and the opportunity costs to the patient per life-year saved). Results from the proposed work will facilitate the broad dissemination of PN to reduce ethnic and racial health disparities in CRC incidence mortality and will advance our understanding of PN.

"Tailored Interactive Multimedia to Reduce Colorectal CA Screening Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interactive multimedia computer programs (IMCPs) show promise as a way of delivering personally tailored (PT) information to enhance cognitive mediators of health behavior and improve patient outcomes. However, it is unclear whether PT IMCPs can be deployed in primary care offices to increase cancer screening uptake and eliminate ethnic disparities in uptake by providing PT information in each user's preferred language. Aims/Hypotheses: We will compare changes in CRC screening cognitive mediators (self- efficacy, perceived barriers, and readiness) and uptake resulting from an IMCP  PT to enhance the key cognitive mediators and targeted to patients' self-identified ethnicity - with changes resulting from a non- tailored ""electronic leaflet"" control IMCP. The experimental and control IMCPs will each be offered in English and Spanish versions. We hypothesize that, compared with the appropriate control condition (English, Spanish, or both combined): (1) the English version of the PT IMCP will enhance the cognitive mediators of CRC screening behavior for English-speaking Hispanics and non-Hispanics; (2) there will be similarly favorable changes in these mediators for Hispanics using the Spanish version of the PT IMCP; (3) deployment of the PT IMCP will provide evidence of elimination of disparities in CRC screening between Hispanic and non-Hispanic subjects via its relative impact on the cognitive mediators in these groups; and (4) the PT IMCP (English and Spanish combined) will increase CRC screening uptake in Hispanics and non-Hispanics (considered separately) via changes in the cognitive mediators. Methods: Randomized controlled trial of 2 groups, comparing a PT (to the cognitive mediators) CRC screening IMCP offered in both English and Spanish versions and deployed before a primary care office visit with a non-tailored ""electronic leaflet"" CRC screening IMCP (control) also offered in both English and Spanish. Screening methods targeted will be fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. Primary outcomes will be CRC screening uptake, self- efficacy, perceived barriers, and readiness. Implications: Our findings will determine whether an IMCP that is PT to cognitive mediators of screening behavior and deployed in primary care offices prior to previously scheduled visits can activate patients of various ethnicities to undergo CRC screening.

"Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Amercians Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, affecting both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups. The majority of these deaths could be prevented since CRC, when discovered early, is highly treatable and screening that leads to removal of adenomatous polyps decreases CRC incidence by 75% to 90%. Nationally, in 2002, only 50% of adults aged 50 or older reported having had any screening test in the recommended intervals. Both CRC incidence and mortality rates are higher among African Americans than any other racial group. These health disparities are due, in part, to delay in diagnosis resulting in advanced stage disease at presentation. Lower rates of CRC screening participation among African Americans contribute to this burden. Interactive computer-based interventions effectively promote health behavior change by delivering individualized, or tailored, health information and counseling. In pilot testing, a tailored, interactive computer intervention designed to promote CRC screening among African Americans resulted in increased CRC knowledge and higher rates of fecal occult blood testing. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a tailored, interactive computer intervention to promote CRC screening by comparing it to, and combining it with, a physician recommendation, which has been found to be a significant predictor of CRC screening. A sample of 1248 African American men and women who are being seen in two Midwestern primary care networks and who are non-adherent to colon cancer screening guidelines will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) a CRC screening brochure; 2) an interactive computer intervention; or 3) the interactive computer intervention plus the brochure. Both process and outcome variables will be examined. Rates of adherence to fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are primary outcomes examined at 6 and 15 months. Logistic regression models will be used to test intervention effects separately for two outcomes, fecal occult blood testing (initial and repeat) and endoscopic screening, while adjusting for potentially confounding covariates. Mediators and moderators of intervention effects and changes in health beliefs related to the interventions also will be determined.         ",Promoting Colon Cancer Screening Among African Amercians,7825479,R01CA115983,"['Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Progress Review Group ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Adoption ', ' Guidelines ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' minority health ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Adenomatous Polyps ', ' polypoid adenoma ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' uptake ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Staging ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Sigmoidoscopy ', ' Proctosigmoidoscopy ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' cancer risk ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Gender ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Documentation ', ' Colon ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' population based ', ' primary care setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' Computers ', ' ']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2010,389993,0.27224856090747285
"RCT/Increase Colon Cancer Screening/Medicaid Managed Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Disparities persist in the colorectal cancer screening. There is need for practical, widely applicable interventions that could correct these disparities. Through previous work (R01-87776) we have developed a Prevention Care Management (PCM) intervention based on telephone support that increased colon cancer screening rates for low income women visiting community/migrant health centers in New York City almost two fold. The earlier project relied on research staff to recruit patients in community/migrant health center (C/MHC) waiting rooms and to provide the intervention, thus, limiting its transportability and sustainability.   This new project in response to PAR 04-036 will be based in Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MMCOs) which can provide sustainable, widely available infrastructures to support colon cancer screening especially for women who comprise a substantial majority of MMCO enrollees. Our first aim is to expand the scope of PCM to apply to MMCO-enrolled women who seldom visit primary care (outreach) while continuing to provide inreach to more frequent attenders. The second aim is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the expanded PCM intervention to assess its impact on colorectal cancer screening status of low-income women age 50-64 years and to describe the process of Prevention Care Management.    Several unique features of the project should be noted: the identification of women overdue for screening through MMCO claims data which is both practical to sustain and expands the reach of the project to include women who seldom visit primary care; the intervention will be delivered by established MMCO staff, not researchers appearing transiently but cannot sustain the intervention; outcomes will be assessed through MMCO claims data; and multiple representative MMCOs in New York City will be involved. Colon cancer screening will be promoted in the context of other indicated screening for breast and cervical cancer.     Aim three will explore the relationship of characteristics of the women (demographics), of the community/migrant health centers that serve them, and of the MMCOs in which they are enrolled to colorectal cancer screening status including the impact of the intervention. Cost of the intervention and its relationship to increased screening rates will be assessed.

"Training African American Peers as Patient Navigators for Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer health disparities related to race and ethnicity are among the most serious problems facing the US health care system. A recent Institute of Medicine report stated that such disparities are seen at every level of health care, from prevention to treatment and follow-up. This problem is acutely evident in the figures for colorectal cancer (CRC) among African Americans (AAs). According to the American Cancer Society, AAs have the highest CRC incidence and mortality of any ethnic/racial group. Indeed, CRC incidence and mortality are 15% and 43% higher among AAs than Whites, respectively. These disparities could be effectively reduced through greater AA participation in CRC screening and early detection. More importantly, due to the preponderance of CRC in AAs beyond the reach of the flexible sigmoidoscopy, increased adherence to colonoscopy among AAs will save lives. Although there is clear evidence that providing patients with someone to help them manage/navigate the health care system (i.e., patient navigation (PN)) is effective in helping them to complete cancer screening, very few hospitals provide PN for colonoscopy. The vast majority of hospitals in NYC are unable to provide PN for patients for whom colonoscopy is recommended, in large part because of the costs associated with professional-led PN. The proposed R-25E seeks to address this serious public health problem by investigating the success of training AAs who have undergone colonoscopy to serve as peer patient navigators to help others from their community complete CRC screening via colonoscopy.       The proposed training plan is supported by seven distinct lines of evidence: 1) research indicating a 76-90% reduction in CRC mortality through colonoscopy, 2) the success of PN in increasing participation in health promotion, 3) data from the NYC Department of Health showing underuse of PN for colonoscopy, 4) research demonstrating increased credibility of peers in providing health information, 5) research on volunteer-led health education interventions, 6) the cost savings we found in our preliminary research on peer led PN (PPN) for colonoscopy, and 7) our success in promoting cancer screening and preventative health care practices in AA communities of New York City through our collaboration with community leaders and church groups.       The overall goal of the proposed R-25E is to reduce CRC morbidity and mortality by increasing AA participation in colonoscopy in a cost effective way. This will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) The development and implementation of a training program for Peer Patient Navigation (PPN) to increase participation of AAs in colonoscopy; 2) The examination of the cost effectiveness of the PPN training program in completion of colonoscopy from the perspective of AAs for whom colonoscopy is recommended; and 3) The investigation of the relative cost effectiveness of the PPN training program from the perspective of hospitals.                   ",Training African American Peers as Patient Navigators for Colon Cancer Screening,7893109,R25CA132692,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Flexible sigmoidoscopy ', ' Fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Hospitals ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Incidence ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' New York City ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Review Literature ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Role playing therapy ', ' role playing (psychodrama) ', ' Role Playing ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Supervision ', ' Tape Recording ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Training Programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' success ', ' peer ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Prevention ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Cost Savings ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' skill acquisition ', ' volunteer ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R25,2010,324000,0.063774931631833
"Barriers to CRC in patients with mental illness.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequently diagnosed cancer and third leading cause of cancer death (after lung, prostate or breast cancer) in the United States. Importantly, unlike prostate, lung, and breast cancers, colorectal cancer screening may detect precancerous polyps or abnormal growth and prevent the development of CRC. With less than 40% of colorectal cancers are detected early, increasing CRC screening is important in all populations. In particular, understanding colorectal cancer screening practices is of great significance among individuals with mental illnesses, which at any given time constitutes approximately 20% of those eligible for colorectal cancer screening. There are barriers and interventions which might be specific to the population with mental illnesses, who are already more vulnerable to poor health outcomes and additionally, can be difficult to reach for treatment. Our preliminary secondary analysis of Veterans Health Administration data suggests that patients with mental illnesses have lower rates of annual fecal occult blood testing compared to an age and sex matched cohort of patients without mental illnesses. One size, one approach does not fit all. To be able to understand barriers and design appropriate interventions to improve colorectal cancer screening rates in this population, we need to first indentify screening rates and issues in various sub-groups of mental illnesses. This proposed secondary analysis study will provide us with that data and additionally, other provider and system related predictors for colorectal cancer screening in patients with mental illnesses. Our premise is that there are distinct barriers to CRC screening in sub-groups of mental illness and understanding those barriers will provide the foundation for effective intervention to improve life saving CRC screening rates. To conduct our analysis of colorectal cancer screening rates in individuals with and without the diagnosis of chronic mental illnesses, we will use a large veteran's health administration database which is the only national database with reliable measures of both primary care and psychiatric variables in one dataset. Results will provide a road map of screening disparities among individual sub-groups of mental illness. We will also identify the significance of demographic factors (such as age, sex, race) and system factors (such as having a primary care provider, frequency of visits to the primary care provider, participation in an integrated health care system involving a social worker and care coordinator) to colorectal cancer screening rates among various sub-groups of the mental illness population. We anticipate that this data will establish the array of barriers in this population and lay the groundwork for interventional studies to increase CRC screening rates among the mental illness population.              Aggarwal RO3 - Project Narrative PAR-06-294 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequently diagnosed cancer and third leading cause of cancer death (after lung, prostate or breast cancer) in the United States.

"Colorectal cancer risk after colonoscopy in elderly diabetes patient and men    DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. Colonoscopy is widely used to screen for CRC. Current guidelines recommend screening colonoscopy once every 10 years in average risk patients over >50 year who have no polyps identified at colonoscopy (i.e., negative colonoscopy). However, the prevalence of CRC and polyps increase with age. In addition, nearly 1/4 of the U.S. population over 60 years of age have diabetes mellitus (DM). Recent data suggest patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have an increased risk of CRC. Furthermore, population-based cancer incidence data have consistently suggested a higher incidence of CRC among men vs. women, and the disparity is most striking among those >65 years. Hence, the negative predictive value of a negative colonoscopy may be lower in patients >65 years who are male or have DM. As a result, there is uncertainty whether the recommended 10-year interval between screening colonoscopies in whom no polyps were identified should apply to elderly men or elderly DM patients. We hypothesize that among patients over the age of 65, the risk of CRC following a negative colonoscopy is higher in men vs. women, and in DM patients vs. non-DM patients. To test this hypothesis, we have designed a population-based cohort study using the linked SEERMedicare   data. The study will determine among the SEER-Medicare population, 1) whether men who have   undergone a negative colonoscopy have a higher subsequent incidence of CRC than women with a   negative colonoscopy; 2) whether DM patients who have undergone a negative colonoscopy have a higher subsequent incidence of CRC than non-DM patients with a negative colonoscopy; 3) whether men or DM patients who have undergone a negative colonoscopy have a lower incidence of CRC than the general SEER-Medicare population who have not undergone colonoscopy and whether the lower incidence persists for up to 10 years; 4) determine the absolute incidence by time of CRC following a colonoscopy without polyps for men, women, all patients with diabetes, men with diabetes, and women with diabetes. Both relative and absolute risks will be examined during the follow-up period. Subgroup analysis will examine the risk for proximal colon cancer and the combined effect of male sex and DM.      Relevance to Public Health: CRC is a common cause of death among the elderly population. Screening for colorectal cancer can reduce the risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality. Given the increased incidence of CRC in elderly male patients or elderly DM patients, it is important to determine whether the recommended 10-year interval between colonoscopies without polyps offers adequate protection to these high risk groups. Our study will help establish the appropriate time interval for elderly men and elderly DM patients to undergo a second colonoscopy following a negative colonoscopy so that they will not be facing an unacceptably high rate of preventable CRC morbidity and mortality.           Given the increased incidence of CRC in elderly male patients or elderly DM patients, it is important to determine whether the recommended 10-year interval between colonoscopies without polyps offers adequate protection to these high risk groups.

"Understanding Mechanisms of Ethnic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a rich literature documenting racial and ethnic disparities in the trajectory of cancer care and outcomes. Through analyses of tumor registry and Medicare data, the Principal Investigator and co-investigators have begun to uncover explanatory mechanisms or pathways underlying such disparities. We and others have identified disparities in survival after a diagnosis of cancer, much of which can be explained by delays in diagnosis leading to more advanced stage at diagnosis, and also by less than adequate treatment. There has also been considerable research on patient-level, physician level, and system- level factors that contribute to disparities in the trajectory of care. In this application we will conduct explanatory analyses with Medicare claims data to identify the mechanisms underlying racial disparities in stage of diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC), with a focus on the role of CRC screening among older adults. We will also develop methods to measure the performance of individual primary care physicians in providing CRC screening for patients. Of particular interest is how individual physicians' performance contributes to racial disparities in screening use. Aim 1: Determine the rate of screening for colorectal cancer in black and white men and women 65- 75 enrolled in fee for service Medicare in Michigan, New Jersey and Texas from 2001 through 2007. Aim 2: Determine the effect of other subject level (predisposing, enabling, and need) and environment level characteristics of CRC screening and determine the effect of continuity of care with a primary care physician (PCP) on receipt of CRC screening. Aim 3: Describe the variation among PCPs in use of CRC screening and determine how much of the race disparity in CRC screening is explained by PCP as opposed to patient characteristics. Aim 4: Examine the effects of provider characteristics (years in practice, age, volume of cases, primary specialty board certification, affiliation with academic medical centers, etc.) and medical system characteristics (PCPs per capita, gastroenterologists per capita) on the likelihood of CRC screening and also stratified by subjects' race. There are a number of options available to Medicare to promote health and reduce health disparities among its beneficiaries. The results of the mechanistic analyses in this application will allow for the design of interventions targeting the specific points in the trajectory of care that contribute to ethnic disparities in CRC screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the U.S., colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most frequently diagnosed but second leading cause of death among cancers. We will study Medicare data to understand better the reasons for racial disparities in CRC screening rates. With this information, Medicare will be able to design and implement interventions to promote health and reduce health disparities among its beneficiaries.          ",Understanding Mechanisms of Ethnic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Screening,7806567,R01CA134275,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Board Certification ', ' Data ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' beneficiary ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Modality ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' social ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' tumor registry ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Gastroenterologist ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New Jersey ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Native Americans ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Staging ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' programs ', ' Specialty Boards ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R01,2010,250660,0.27898437644292134
"Patient Navigation for CRC Screening with Low-Income Minorities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal Cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates are highest in African Americans (AA's) compared with all other ethnic groups. One factor that may contribute to this trend is the lower rate of participation in CRC screening among AAs, which is critical to the prevention and early detection of CRC. Recent data indicate that the removal of precancerous polyps (via colonoscopy) decreases CRC incidence by 75-90 percent. Despite the implementation of national policy changes to increase CRC screening (through Medicaid/Medicare reimbursement for CRC screening and easier ""open"" access to colonoscopy) adherence remains alarmingly low. Our preliminary data show that, even after implementation of standard patient navigation (SPN) (i.e., assisting patients with making/keeping their appointments), only 40 percent of low-income minorities followed-through on their physician recommendation. Guided by Cognitive-Behavioral Social Learning Theory as a conceptual framework and cultural targeting as an intervention strategy, the proposed randomized clinical trial will investigate integrating within SPN a targeted discussion of intrapersonal and cultural barriers to colonoscopy (i.e., fear, lack of knowledge, medical mistrust, fatalism and fear) prevalent with low-income AAs. Based on research on source credibility and reference group-based social identity theory, we will also explore navigator status as a peer on the impact of culturally targeted PN. Thus, we will compare three PN strategies: SPN carried out by a professional navigator, Culturally Targeted PN carried out by a professional (CTPN-Pro) and Culturally Targeted PN carried out by a peer who has undergone colonoscopy (CTPN-Peer). Specific Aims: Aim 1: Compare the efficacy of SPN, CTPN-Pro, and CTPN-Peer on adherence to colonoscopy CRC screening in average risk, low-income AAs who have a primary care physician referral for colonoscopy. Aim 2: Explore potential mechanisms (i.e., mediators) underlying the beneficial effects of CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer and to examine for whom the CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer are most effective (i.e., moderators). Aim 3: Compare the cost effectiveness of CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer. Cost effectiveness will be examined in terms of direct clinical costs of screening (i.e., savings associated with more efficient use of personnel, space, and equipment) and patient costs (i.e., costs of CRC treatment and the opportunity costs to the patient per life-year saved). Results from the proposed work will facilitate the broad dissemination of PN to reduce ethnic and racial health disparities in CRC incidence mortality and will advance our understanding of PN.           ",Patient Navigation for CRC Screening with Low-Income Minorities,7871506,R01CA120658,"['Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Colon ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' opportunity cost ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' coping ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Equipment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' trend ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Flexible sigmoidoscopy ', ' Fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Guidelines ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Incidence ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Policies ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Rectum ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Appointment ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Polypectomy ', ' PLYPCMY ', ' American ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' social ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2010,624109,0.2507459494330408
"Geographic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Survival    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. Despite declines in CRC incidence rates, survival following diagnosis has improved only modestly over the past few decades. Even though environmental contexts play an important role in health, disease, and behavior, most studies about CRC survival have largely ignored the geographic variation and importance of area-level socioeconomic conditions that have been associated with CRC screening, CRC stage at diagnosis, and with the survival of many other cancers. CRC patients who live in areas with worse socioeconomic conditions have decreased survival than those who live under more affluent conditions; however, the mechanisms by which these area-level factors exert their influence on CRC survival remain unclear. This amended application of the proposed population-based, prospective study has three specific aims. Aim 1) Determine the extent of the geographic variation of CRC survival across the United States based on small geographic areas at the sub-county (census-tract) level using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data for over 100,000 men and women aged 66 or older diagnosed with CRC. Aim 2) Determine the extent to which lower CRC survival can be explained by higher area socioeconomic deprivation among persons age 66 and older. Aim 3) Identify potential mediating pathways by which higher area socioeconomic deprivation is associated with lower CRC survival among persons age 66 and older, namely a) patient characteristics, b) physician and hospital characteristics, c) tumor characteristics, d) type of treatment received, and e) surveillance for CRC after diagnosis to detect recurrence and metastases. A multilevel spatial model will be developed to address the specific aims of the proposed study. We will use the following existing data sources: 1) 1992-2005 data from NCI's SEER program (survival, patient characteristics, type of treatment, tumor characteristics); 2) 1991-2005 Medicare data (patient characteristics, type of treatment, surveillance after diagnosis) which is linked to the SEER data; 3) 1991-2005 data from the Provider of Services File (hospital and physician characteristics), 4) 1990-2005 census data (area deprivation measures), and 5) Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data. Advanced Bayesian spatial analyses of CRC survival will be performed and a geographic information system will be used to display the results. Our study will increase understanding of and identify important mechanisms of the role of area-level socioeconomic deprivation on CRC survival. In addition, this study will help provide opportunities for targeting specific geographic areas to allocate resources and interventions locally to improve CRC survival using evidence- based approaches, thereby reducing health disparities associated with living in socioeconomically deprived areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths. To reduce geographic disparities in survival following colorectal cancer and to develop and implement interventions that can be targeted locally, it is imperative to identify reasons for lower-than-expected survival.              Narrative Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths.

"Impact of Remote Familial Risk Assesment and Counseling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rate of adherence to regular colonoscopy screening among members of families at increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) is far below recommended levels. Persons who live in rural areas of the United States exhibit lower colorectal screening rates than their urban counterparts. Although the detection of familial predisposition to cancer begins with an accurate family medical history, data indicate that many patients do not receive adequate familial cancer risk assessment from their primary care providers. This suggests that familial risk is largely unrecognized which may lead to inadequate risk stratification, lack of risk notification, appropriate risk counseling, suboptimal cancer screening and preventable deaths. Because of geographic and system-level barriers, special efforts are needed to improve access to personalized risk communication and adherence to CRC screening in rural dwellers at increased risk for CRC. In the proposed study, we will evaluate a novel telephone-based, theory-guided personalized risk communication intervention that combines a familial CRC risk assessment and behavioral counseling with tailored messages. The key hypothesis guiding this study is that a more intensive personalized risk communication intervention will improve CS at a significantly higher rate than a low-intensity targeted print intervention. Our integrative study model specifies important theoretical mechanisms that can contribute to increased use of CS among persons at increased risk. We will enroll 712 rural adult men and women age 40 years and older who are considered at increased risk of familial CRC into this 2-group randomized trial. The primary aim of this study is to compare colonoscopy use among participants in the two groups. Secondary aims are to compare the two groups with regard to cognitive and emotional outcomes and explore the underlying mechanisms through which the interventions have an impact on colonoscopy behavior. Sociodemographic, clinical, behavioral and psychosocial measures will be collected from participants at baseline, 1 month, 6 months and 1 year. The study's findings will have both theoretical, as well as practical, significance. Our findings will help to influence the selection and dissemination of effective outreach approaches to improve CRC screening in populations at increased risk for the disease. These results have broad applicability to understanding responses to personalized risk communication interventions for other diseases as well. Findings will also broaden our understanding of the underlying theoretical mechanisms of how remote cancer risk communications lead to improvements in cancer screening among geographically underserved populations if such intervention effects are observed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Provision of personalized risk assessment and behavioral counseling services via the telephone is likely to ensure equitable access to cancer communications for rural and other underserved groups. Such interventions have the potential to translate into improved colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates among rural dwellers at increased risk for the disease by removing geographic and other barriers to accessing potentially life-saving cancer risk communications. Our study is highly responsive to national health communication and health disparity priorities, and will provide data that are needed to influence the development and dissemination of effective cancer communication interventions to high-risk individuals who reside in geographically underserved areas.",Impact of Remote Familial Risk Assesment and Counseling,7778862,R01CA125194,"['Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Hereditary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' familial cancer ', ' Hereditary Cancer ', ' Familiar Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Emotions ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Health Communication ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Stratification ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Family ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Guidelines ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' uptake ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Family Cancer History ', ' Study models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Printing ', ' Staging ', ' Recommendation ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Utah ', ' Notification ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' cancer risk ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' metropolitan ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' outreach ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' risk perception ', ' psychological distress ', ' Emotional ', ' Family member ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communication ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' primary care setting ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' randomized trial ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2010,626031,0.20689169331301302
"Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening among African American    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Career Development Award will facilitate Dr. Richard C. Palmer's growth as an independent cancer prevention and control research scientist. The long-term career goal of the candidate is to translate research findings into effective health policy aimed at reducing health disparities. The candidate's immediate career goal is to establish himself as an interdisciplinary research scientist able to lead observational and intervention studies aimed at understanding and addressing cancer health disparities. To achieve this goal, the candidate proposes a career development plan that includes professional development, manuscript and grant preparation, and a research plan to collect pilot data. The proposed research plan extends the candidate's prior research work in colorectal cancer (CRC) and builds on work that the candidate has already conducted in addressing CRC disparities seen for African Americans. African Americans experience higher incidence and greater mortality from CRC in comparison to non-Hispanic whites and have low participation in CRC screening. Regular screening can reduce both morbidity and mortality from CRC and offers the possibility of early detection and prevention. Interventions to increase screening rates for African Americans are needed if parity is to be achieved. The primary goal of the proposed research will be to develop and test an interactive multimedia program that is aimed at increasing awareness about CRC, knowledge of testing options, decision-making, and increasing participation in CRC among African American primary care patients. To develop the interactive program, appropriate health messages promoting CRC screening will be developed and tested to examine their effect on attitudes toward CRC screening and behavioral intention. Once developed, a randomized trial will be conducted to assess the impact of the interactive multimedia program. This interactive multimedia application represents a novel approach to improving CRC screening behavior among African Americans in primary health care settings. If the interactive multimedia program is effective, it could be an inexpensive way to increase knowledge and compliance with CRC screening guidelines and other screening tests for this population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans have lower rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening participation and are more likely to die from the disease as compared to non-Hispanic whites and other racial/ethnic minorities. Consequently, interventions are needed to help address this inequity. This study will develop and test a multimedia intervention strategy aimed at increasing awareness of CRC, knowledge of testing options, and CRC screening participation among African American patients of a primary care clinic. If the multimedia education tool is effective, it could be an inexpensive way to increase compliance with CRC screening guidelines and possibly other cancer screening tests for this population.               7.

We propose to continue this collaboration, further developing our models and using them to identify optimal cancer-control policies and practices to reduce the burden of CRC.      Our proposed work centers around three specific aims. In Aim 1 we extend our models to reflect the evolving understanding of the CRC disease processes and to incorporate new and updated screening modalities, allowing us to address new policy questions.

"Genetic Association Studies in African American Colorectal Cancer Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant cause of cancer morbidity and mortality affecting almost 150,000 Americans yearly. African Americans have the highest CRC incidence and mortality of all US populations. These disparities have not been explained, and biological risk factors including genetic susceptibility to CRC are understudied in African Americans. I am a gastroenterologist who seeks to develop a career as an independent translational physician-scientist in CRC genetics. My long-term career goals require me to obtain additional training in: 1) molecular and statistical genetics; and 2) cancer biology. The 5-year career development program described in this application will take place at the University of Chicago which distinguishes itself in the field of human and cancer genetics especially in admixed populations. I am fortunate to have key collaborators at the University of North Carolina and the University of Illinois Chicago, and together we have DNA from over 1000 African American CRC patients and 1000 African American control subjects available for my proposed study. Dr. Nancy Cox, Professor of Medicine and Chief of Human Genetics, is my mentor and will provide expertise in statistical genetics. Dr. Nathan Ellis, Associate Professor of Medicine, is a co-mentor and will provide expertise in CRC molecular genetics. An inter-disciplinary Advisory Committee comprised of Dr. Rick Kittles, an expert in genetics of admixed populations, Dr. Olufunmilayo Olopade, an internationally recognized leader in cancer genetics, and Dr. Eugene Chang, a successful physician-scientist in gastroenterology, will guide and advise me during this development period. The broad objectives of this research proposal are the identification of genetic susceptibility factors that contribute to risk of CRC development in African Americans. I will study single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered using genome-wide association studies in European populations. Regions containing these SNP are likely to harbor functional variants. African Americans are an ideal population in whom to identify functional variants because their genomes exhibit less linkage disequilibrium. To this end, I propose three specific aims: 1) Validate candidate CRC-associated regions in African American cases and controls; 2) Discover novel SNPs in CRC-associated regions by targeted resequencing using next-generation sequencing technologies; and 3) Identify putative functional variants in candidate CRC-associated regions that can be further evaluated in future functional studies. By the end of my career development period, I will be uniquely equipped to undertake further translational research in CRC genetics. My long-term research goals are to understand genetic susceptibility in CRC pathogenesis and to study how genetic susceptibility factors can be used to risk stratify individuals for CRC screening and thereby prevent disease especially in high risk but understudied populations like African Americans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of all US populations, African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer. Reasons for these differences are not explained, and hereditary factors have not been extensively studied in this high risk population. The goal of our study is to better understand hereditary factors that increase risk of colorectal cancer especially in African-Americans.           Project Narrative Of all US populations, African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer.

"NYU PREVENTION RESEARCH CENTER: COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH PROGRAM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The translation of these evidence-based approaches into community-based settings is necessary for achieving the Healthy People 2010 goals of reducing racial disparities in HTN-related outcomes and CRC mortality in Black men. This application provides a unique opportunity to address this gap in the literature by simultaneously evaluating the effectiveness of three evidence-based interventions aimed at improving HTN and CRC screening levels in Black men. Specifically, the investigative team will leverage resources from two already-funded NIH randomized controlled trials to develop a new and third arm to the study and apply rigorous CER methodology to evaluate the added cost-benefit and value of each strategy on health outcomes. The proposed study will examine the efficacy and effectiveness of lifestyle counseling, PN, and the combination of lifestyle counseling and PN for Black men. The intervention will be implemented in two community-based settings, Black-owned barbershops (BOBs) and faith-based institutions, both of which have important cultural and social significance in the target population.   Specific Aims   Aim 1. To leverage resources and conduct a multi-factorial community-based CER study in urban Black communities aimed at reducing HTN and CRC disparities   Aim 2: To estimate and compare the effect of Aim 1 interventions on morbidity and mortality   Aim 3: To identify and disseminate the optimal portfolio of HTN and CRC interventions in Aim 1 that maximizes societal benefit when disseminated broadly.          ",NYU PREVENTION RESEARCH CENTER: COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH PROGRAM,8051931,U48DP002671,[''],NCCDPHP,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U48,2010,3287881,0.14080917138481877
"Modeling Effective Health Policies for Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Despite recent declines in both incidence and mortality, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States. The present project aims to provide guidance on how to further reduce the burden of this disease, considering interventions based on primary prevention, screening, and treatment improvement. To this end, a wide range of issues is addressed in order to provide an overview of relative effects of alternative intervention policies. This study is a collaboration between Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Erasmus University (Erasmus MC) in Rotterdam.      We use a population based microsimulation model (MISCAN-Colon) to assess the effect of individual interventions and combinations on the burden of CRC. MISCAN was originally developed by Erasmus MC to assess screening interventions and has been extended in our current project to incorporate changes in risk factors, chemoprevention and treatment efficacy. This model simulates the full dynamic US population which makes it particularly suitable for assessment of effects of interventions on a population level, including effects on CRC incidence and mortality, and also on quality of life, demands for medical capacity and economic burden over time.       In order to make reliable projections for the future, it is necessary to understand to what extent the decline in CRC incidence and mortality is attributable to changes in exposures to ""lifestyle"" factors, changes in use of screening, changes in treatment, or combinations of these factors. Therefore, the specific aims are to use the MISCAN microsimulation model to 1.) Estimate the absolute and relative contribution of changing lifestyle factors, screening, and improved therapy on the observed trends in CRC incidence and mortality in the United States 1975-2002; and then to explore future scenarios to 2.) Evaluate the potential impact of current and newly developing technologies on lifestyle interventions, chemoprevention, screening, and treatment improvement on future trends in CRC incidence and mortality in the US and 3.) Translate the impact of implementation of interventions found to be effective in reducing incidence and mortality under Aim 2, into the burden of colorectal cancer also with respect to life years gained, quality of life, required medical capacity and economic burden. Aims 2 and 3 will also consider targeted intervention for individuals with increased risk due to familial predisposition.      The results from these analyses can be used to inform decisions of directing medical and public health resources to the most effective interventions in the appropriate risk groups. We will collaborate with NCI and other CISNET investigators in conducting this work.

"Understanding Racial and Ethnic Differences in Survival from Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancers are the third most common invasive cancers among men and women in the United States. Improvements in prevention, screening and treatment have resulted in decreasing case-fatality rates from colorectal cancer since the 1980s. Paradoxically, disparities in survival from this cancer especially between Blacks and Whites have widened over time. Although there is no consensus in existing literature, current evidence suggests that factors related to access to health care including socioeconomic differences contribute to these disparities. The goal of the proposed research program is to identify potentially modifiable causes of disparities in cancer survival with a long range goal of reducing or eliminating the disproportionate burden of colorectal cancer among certain patient populations. The specific aims for this project are to: 1) compare colorectal cancer survival rates by race/ethnicity over the period 1993 through 2004; 2) compare the distribution of tumor stage at diagnosis for colorectal cancer by race/ethnicity; 3) examine potential mediators of the relationship of survival and race/ethnicity among colorectal cancer patients; 4) examine the patterns of care of survivors of colorectal cancer; and 5) explore the effect of socioeconomic status on the relationship between race/ethnicity and survival among colorectal cancer patients. This project will be conducted on a large racially diverse cohort comprised of patients 20 years and older diagnosed with colorectal cancer (1993 to 2004) while enrolled in one of four integrated health care systems that are affiliated with the National Cancer Institute-funded Cancer Research Network. This research plan is part of a career development program aimed at providing the training and experience needed for Dr. Doubeni to become an independently funded clinician-investigator focusing on disparities in cancer survival. The objectives of the career development plan are to acquire knowledge and skills in: 1) cancer biology, epidemiology and treatment; 2) advanced research methods; 3) scientific writing; and 4) the translation of research into practice and policy. The career development program will be accomplished through mentoring and targeted advanced courses. The studies encompassed under the proposed research program will make important contributions to our understanding of racial/ethnic differences in cancer survival rates. The proposed project will lay the foundation for the candidate's long-term career goal of designing system-based interventions aimed at eliminating disparities in cancer care and survival, a major objective of HealthyPeople 2010.          ",Understanding Racial and Ethnic Differences in Survival from Colorectal Cancer,8127888,K01CA127118,"['Tumor stage ', ' T-Stage ', ' cancer care ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Mentors ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Services ', ' Time ', ' Goals ', ' Series ', ' Prevention ', ' Training ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Investigators ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Patients ', ' Foundations ', ' experience ', ' Knowledge ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Pattern ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Research ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' career ', ' Woman ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Development Plans ', ' Medical ', ' Funding ', ' skills ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Survivors ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Writing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Literature ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Caring ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' United States ', ' Policies ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' patient population ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Consensus ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' cohort ', ' career development ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' Cancer Research Network ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K01,2011,58128,0.1517192577714638
"Colorectal Cancer Education and Screening Program (CCESP)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is an essential component to the reduction of cancer health disparities. By using CBPR with community partners, we will increase colorectal cancer screening in underserved areas. In order to increase screening, we plan to provide education and screening for Arkansans in two underserved counties in the Arkansas Delta, specifically Northeast (Mississippi County) and Southeast (St. Francis County). Both education and provision of FOBT kits with reminders are proven means of increasing screening rates. A combination of the two has not been investigated to determine if screening rates can be further improved. Based on this, we hypothesize that a CBPR intervention providing education, awareness and FOBT screening tests in two underserved communities will Increase screening uptake rates above either treatment alone or control. We will test the hypothesis through the following Specific Aims:      Specific Aim 1: Implement standard, culturally tailored, and no treatment control co-developed interventions for colorectal cancer screening in collaboration with community partners to increase uptake of colorectal screening via FOBT screening techniques.   Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy of the standard and culturally tailored screening interventions (treatment arms) on uptake of colorectal cancer screening compared to the no treatment control arm and to each other   Specific Aim 3: Develop a dissemination plan of preliminary findings to distribute to community partners and research community as they become available.      Upon completion of the CBPR intervention, the collaboration of community partners and academicians will result in reduction of CRC disparities through education, increased knowledge, and screening. Our novel approach partners academia with the community in all aspects of a CBPR study evaluating a previously unexplored combination of education and provision of FOBT cards and reminders to increase colorectal cancer screening.

"Patient Navigation for CRC Screening with Low-Income Minorities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal Cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates are highest in African Americans (AA's) compared with all other ethnic groups. One factor that may contribute to this trend is the lower rate of participation in CRC screening among AAs, which is critical to the prevention and early detection of CRC. Recent data indicate that the removal of precancerous polyps (via colonoscopy) decreases CRC incidence by 75-90 percent. Despite the implementation of national policy changes to increase CRC screening (through Medicaid/Medicare reimbursement for CRC screening and easier ""open"" access to colonoscopy) adherence remains alarmingly low. Our preliminary data show that, even after implementation of standard patient navigation (SPN) (i.e., assisting patients with making/keeping their appointments), only 40 percent of low-income minorities followed-through on their physician recommendation. Guided by Cognitive-Behavioral Social Learning Theory as a conceptual framework and cultural targeting as an intervention strategy, the proposed randomized clinical trial will investigate integrating within SPN a targeted discussion of intrapersonal and cultural barriers to colonoscopy (i.e., fear, lack of knowledge, medical mistrust, fatalism and fear) prevalent with low-income AAs. Based on research on source credibility and reference group-based social identity theory, we will also explore navigator status as a peer on the impact of culturally targeted PN. Thus, we will compare three PN strategies: SPN carried out by a professional navigator, Culturally Targeted PN carried out by a professional (CTPN-Pro) and Culturally Targeted PN carried out by a peer who has undergone colonoscopy (CTPN-Peer). Specific Aims: Aim 1: Compare the efficacy of SPN, CTPN-Pro, and CTPN-Peer on adherence to colonoscopy CRC screening in average risk, low-income AAs who have a primary care physician referral for colonoscopy. Aim 2: Explore potential mechanisms (i.e., mediators) underlying the beneficial effects of CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer and to examine for whom the CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer are most effective (i.e., moderators). Aim 3: Compare the cost effectiveness of CTPN-Pro and CTPN-Peer. Cost effectiveness will be examined in terms of direct clinical costs of screening (i.e., savings associated with more efficient use of personnel, space, and equipment) and patient costs (i.e., costs of CRC treatment and the opportunity costs to the patient per life-year saved). Results from the proposed work will facilitate the broad dissemination of PN to reduce ethnic and racial health disparities in CRC incidence mortality and will advance our understanding of PN.           ",Patient Navigation for CRC Screening with Low-Income Minorities,8123371,R01CA120658,"['Transportation ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' opportunity cost ', ' Communities ', ' Risk ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Address ', ' improved ', ' Life ', ' Cognitive ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Savings ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Methods ', ' Measures ', ' Appointment ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' trend ', ' coping ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Prevention ', ' novel ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Minority ', ' social ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Modeling ', ' Recommendation ', ' Guidelines ', ' peer ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Low income ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Colon ', ' evidence base ', ' Policies ', ' Equipment ', ' Medical ', ' Source ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' theories ', ' cost ', ' Ensure ', ' Clinical ', ' Work ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Knowledge ', ' Incidence ', ' Behavioral ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' Data ', ' base ', ' Research ', ' Physicians ', ' Patients ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Flexible sigmoidoscopy ', ' Fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Polypectomy ', ' PLYPCMY ', ' Rectum ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2011,554293,0.2507459494330408
"Development of Tailored Intervention to Promote CRC Screening Among Latino Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to the Program Announcement ""Health Promotion among Racial and Ethnic Minority Males"" (PA-07-421).  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality among Latinos despite effective screening methods. While rates of screening overall have increased, the disparities in CRC screening between non-Latino Whites and Latinos have also increased. Even after accounting for socioeconomic factors, screening rates are lower for Latinos than for non-Latino Whites suggesting that there are other factors and barriers to CRC screening that are specific to Latinos.  A conceptual framework known as ""positive deviance"" is a particularly promising approach for addressing barriers to CRC screening among Latinos. The central premise behind positive deviance is that solutions to common problems found in a community often already exist in that community but they go unrecognized and so are underutilized. A positive deviance approach identifies behaviors associated with success and disseminates strategies for adopting these behaviors to others. When applied to CRC screening, this approach can identify specific barriers to screening as well as strategies to overcome these barriers. Video is an ideal medium for disseminating the strategies that ""positive deviants"" or ""successful peers"" use to overcome barriers to CRC screening. A positive deviance approach combined with video can thus capitalize on the screening behaviors of ""successful peers"" in a community and make behavioral interventions particularly relevant and culturally appropriate to others in that community.  The purpose of this proposal is to explore barriers to CRC screening encountered by Spanish-speaking Latino men, identify successful strategies used by successful peers to overcome barriers and in so doing, use a positive deviance approach to develop a culturally and linguistically appropriate tailored video-based intervention to increase CRC screening among Spanish-speaking Latino men.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer screening rates are low, especially among Latinos with limited English proficiency. ""Positive deviants"" or ""successful peers"" are those individuals in a community who practice a healthy behavior (e.g. colorectal cancer screening) when the majority do not. This project will use a ""positive deviance"" approach to create a culturally and linguistically appropriate innovative personalized video intervention to promote colorectal cancer screening among Spanish-speaking Latino men.           Colorectal cancer screening rates are low, especially among Latinos with limited English proficiency.

"Investigating the role of mutation sequence and microRNAs in colorectal cancer de    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well established that genetic and epigenetic alterations play important roles in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). A major challenge to our understanding of how this process occurs is to understand how these genetic and epigenetic changes work pathologically to allow for uncontrolled cancer cell growth. Until now, the systematic dissection of the signaling pathways and genes that control CRC initiation and progression have been limited by the use of primary human tumor samples, lack of suitable long-term culture systems, and mouse models that do not accurately recapitulate this process. The recent development of a robust long-term primary colonic epithelium culture system by our group that is capable of modeling tumorigenesis affords the opportunity to begin to explore the role of differential sequence of oncogene and tumor suppressor gene activation or inactivation, respectively, and the functional evaluation of CRC-upregulated or downregulated microRNAs in the development of CRC. Specifically, this proposal seeks to address the hypothesis that the sequence in which one acquires genetic alterations alters CRC progression, and possibly clinical outcomes. Likewise, this proposal seeks to functionally validate the role of microRNAs that are differentially expressed in CRC vs. normal human colonic epithelium. The studies proposed herein will facilitate our fundamental understanding of colon cancer initiation and progression, allowing for the development of more efficacious and targeted approaches to therapy.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal Cancer is a diverse and heterogeneous disease that is caused by the progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations. Health disparities and diverse clinical outcomes can be partially attributed to the specific genetic alteration that occurs within a specific tumor. Understanding how alterations in gene function, or the sequence in which one acquires them, and how changes in microRNA expression contribute to colorectal cancer development will provide novel insights that will contribute to our ability to develop better treatments, therapies, and/or diagnostic tools.           Project Narrative Colorectal Cancer is a diverse and heterogeneous disease that is caused by the progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations.

"Communicating Colorectal Cancer Prevention thru Urban African American Churches    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans, one of the largest minorities in the country fare worse in colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality when compared to several other races and often have negative perceptions to screening (Greiner, et al. 2005). Research indicates religion and spirituality as components that should be considered when appealing to individuals about health and making health decisions (Egbert, Mickley, Coeling, 2004). African Americans in particular are highly religious and also regularly attend church services more than any group in the country (Pew, 2007). The goals then of the proposed 5-year study are to obtain crucial preliminary data beyond the Minority Supplement that show the African American church as an important vehicle of cancer communication among African Americans. The central hypothesis of this overall research plan is that church-sponsored messages will have greater impact on cancer screening behavior outcome and will be more appealing to African Americans than traditional cancer-sponsored screening messages. The proposed research is innovative because it capitalizes on the church and prevalent social and cultural norms to socially market the product of CRC screening to promote healthy behavior among African Americans. The trust and social cohesion within the church will promote health messages to motivate or persuade individuals to perform cancer screening. The outcomes of this research will be novel information about how religion and church-sponsored materials relate to perceptions and attitudes; and how religion and the church in CRC cancer screening messages impact screening behavior among African Americans. The findings and results of the proposed interdisciplinary research will benefit African Americans' health because the outcomes will lead to improve health campaigns and communications to targeted populations at risk for cancer disparities. First, a series of qualitative studies among church pastors and congregants will be necessary to formulate a survey instrument to measure perceptions and attitudes about church-sponsored messages in CRC cancer communication materials disseminated via church networks and traditional media networks. Second, the newly developed instrument will be administered to a sample of church-going and church-affiliated individuals to further assess and quantify attitudes and perceptions. Third, a pilot intervention will be conducted to test the impact of church-sponsored messages on perceptions and CRC cancer preventive behaviors. This study is strategically designed to build new understanding of the impact of the church and religiosity on perceptions and behavior that will help the optimization of CRC cancer screening among this population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans die or suffer from colorectal cancer disproportionately when compared to other races in the U.S. Because African Americans are one of the largest groups that report high religious attendance, this study examines the influence of the African American church in increasing colorectal cancer screening among this population. The church is examined as a sponsor of cancer screening promotion compared to traditional cancer organizations (e.g. American Cancer Society) that promote prevention and screening.             African Americans die or suffer from colorectal cancer disproportionately when compared to other races in the U.S. Because African Americans are one of the largest groups that report high religious attendance, this study examines the influence of the African American church in increasing colorectal cancer screening among this population.

"USING PHOTOVOICE TO ENGAGE COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN PROMOTING COLORECTAL CANCER AWARE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, but it can be prevented or detected early through screening. Many racial/ethnic minority groups and those who are low income or uninsured have lower rates of screening, later stage of diagnosis, and poorer survival. Given the low public awareness about CRC and screening, one way to begin addressing CRC disparities is through community engagement. We have established a colorectal cancer partnership to begin addressing the disparities in our community. This Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) project emerged out of discussions with the Partnership. Community members were involved in the conceptualization of the ideas and are involved in several phases of the research implementation, analysis, and dissemination. In this study, we propose to implement a Photovoice project to help understand community needs and awareness of CRC and use those findings to develop CRC awareness intervention messages. Participants in the Photovoice project will be trained to use cameras to photograph their depictions of the meaning of CRC or CRC screening in their lives. Participants develop an individual narrative describing their selected photographs and group discussions will ensue where participants can discuss the meaning and context of the images. We will separate Photovoice groups into persons who have been screened and persons who have been diagnosed with CRC so that we can gather messages about prevention as well as early detection. Screener and survivor Photovoice groups will be held in two different medically underserved neighborhoods (north city and south city) in Saint Louis. Using this rubric, a total of four Photovoice groups will be held with 12 participants each. After the Photovoice project and at the discretion of the Photovoice participants, we will use a participatory process to select some of the Photovoice products for use as potential intervention messages. Such messages will then undergo formative testing using focus groups with people who have and have not been screened. Focus groups will be held in the same neighborhood locations as were the Photovoice sessions. The Specific Aims of this study are: (1) Engage community members in participatory research to identify relevant messages and images about colorectal cancer prevention and early detection using a Photovoice approach; and (2) Use the images and narratives from the Photovoice project as the basis for intervention messages that will be pre- tested using focus groups. Our expected long-term outcomes will be a stronger community partnership, community members empowered to advocate for their health, and a set of community-driven scientifically- evaluated CRC-intervention messages. In addressing colorectal cancer disparities, this study involves a significant public health issue and will lay the foundation for future CBPR work in the Saint Louis community.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Participants will be provided with cameras and asked to take photographs that reflect the meaning or impact of the health issue (colorectal cancer, screening) in their lives and then will meet with others to discuss the meaning and messages that they feel the photographs portray. Photographs with accompanying narrative messages will be evaluated for likability, interpretation, credibility, and salience of messages by focus groups to prepare messages for use in future intervention trials.              Participants will be provided with cameras and asked to take photographs that reflect the meaning or impact of the health issue (colorectal cancer, screening) in their lives and then will meet with others to discuss the meaning and messages that they feel the photographs portray.

"Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening among African American    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Career Development Award will facilitate Dr. Richard C. Palmer's growth as an independent cancer prevention and control research scientist. The long-term career goal of the candidate is to translate research findings into effective health policy aimed at reducing health disparities. The candidate's immediate career goal is to establish himself as an interdisciplinary research scientist able to lead observational and intervention studies aimed at understanding and addressing cancer health disparities. To achieve this goal, the candidate proposes a career development plan that includes professional development, manuscript and grant preparation, and a research plan to collect pilot data. The proposed research plan extends the candidate's prior research work in colorectal cancer (CRC) and builds on work that the candidate has already conducted in addressing CRC disparities seen for African Americans. African Americans experience higher incidence and greater mortality from CRC in comparison to non-Hispanic whites and have low participation in CRC screening. Regular screening can reduce both morbidity and mortality from CRC and offers the possibility of early detection and prevention. Interventions to increase screening rates for African Americans are needed if parity is to be achieved. The primary goal of the proposed research will be to develop and test an interactive multimedia program that is aimed at increasing awareness about CRC, knowledge of testing options, decision-making, and increasing participation in CRC among African American primary care patients. To develop the interactive program, appropriate health messages promoting CRC screening will be developed and tested to examine their effect on attitudes toward CRC screening and behavioral intention. Once developed, a randomized trial will be conducted to assess the impact of the interactive multimedia program. This interactive multimedia application represents a novel approach to improving CRC screening behavior among African Americans in primary health care settings. If the interactive multimedia program is effective, it could be an inexpensive way to increase knowledge and compliance with CRC screening guidelines and other screening tests for this population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans have lower rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening participation and are more likely to die from the disease as compared to non-Hispanic whites and other racial/ethnic minorities. Consequently, interventions are needed to help address this inequity. This study will develop and test a multimedia intervention strategy aimed at increasing awareness of CRC, knowledge of testing options, and CRC screening participation among African American patients of a primary care clinic. If the multimedia education tool is effective, it could be an inexpensive way to increase compliance with CRC screening guidelines and possibly other cancer screening tests for this population.               7.

"African Americans and Colorectal Cancer: A Multilevel Model to Assess Factors for    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite evidence that early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) effectively prevents premature deaths, racial disparities in CRC persist and the gap is widening, especially among African Americans. Underutilization of cancer screening services often results in late stage diagnosis and higher mortality rates. Behavioral interventions to increase CRC screening have produced mixed results; therefore, a better understanding of factors that contribute to cancer health disparities is warranted. A review of the literature reveals four promising psychosocial/cultural factors: trust, social support, risk perception, and religiousness that have high potential to inform intervention research design. Additionally, as shown by empirical evidence, the behaviors of individuals and their social and physical environments are mutually influential. Since the study population resides in urban neighborhoods, characterized by poverty and racial residential segregation, a better understanding of neighborhood level factors contributing to cancer health disparities also is necessary. The literature shows interventions that take into account the environment of the individual are more likely to be successful. The proposed research will use a socio-ecologic framework to examine and understand both individual- and neighborhood-level factors associated with CRC screening. The proposed research has three specific aims:1) Investigate the associations among individual-level factors (e.g., psychosocial/cultural constructs, sociodemographics) and their relationship with CRC screening; 2) Characterize the associations among neighborhood-level factors (e.g., socioeconomic index, residential poverty, education, income) and their relationship with CRC screening; and 3) Explore the associations of individual-level factors, including perceptions of neighborhoods, and neighborhood-level factors with CRC screening using multi-level modeling. My ultimate aim is to build a research career focused on understanding the combined effects of individual and neighborhood level factors that may contribute to the development of scientifically sound and culturally relevant community-based interventions to increase CRC screening among African Americans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NIH encourages research that promotes an understanding of the factors contributing to cancer health disparities. My proposed research will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships among individual and neighborhood level factors that may explain CRC health disparities; thus, improving community-based interventions designed to increase CRC screening among African Americans.           Relevance Statement NIH encourages research that promotes an understanding of the factors contributing to cancer health disparities.

"Tailored Interactive Multimedia to Reduce Colorectal CA Screening Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interactive multimedia computer programs (IMCPs) show promise as a way of delivering personally tailored (PT) information to enhance cognitive mediators of health behavior and improve patient outcomes. However, it is unclear whether PT IMCPs can be deployed in primary care offices to increase cancer screening uptake and eliminate ethnic disparities in uptake by providing PT information in each user's preferred language. Aims/Hypotheses: We will compare changes in CRC screening cognitive mediators (self- efficacy, perceived barriers, and readiness) and uptake resulting from an IMCP  PT to enhance the key cognitive mediators and targeted to patients' self-identified ethnicity - with changes resulting from a non- tailored ""electronic leaflet"" control IMCP. The experimental and control IMCPs will each be offered in English and Spanish versions. We hypothesize that, compared with the appropriate control condition (English, Spanish, or both combined): (1) the English version of the PT IMCP will enhance the cognitive mediators of CRC screening behavior for English-speaking Hispanics and non-Hispanics; (2) there will be similarly favorable changes in these mediators for Hispanics using the Spanish version of the PT IMCP; (3) deployment of the PT IMCP will provide evidence of elimination of disparities in CRC screening between Hispanic and non-Hispanic subjects via its relative impact on the cognitive mediators in these groups; and (4) the PT IMCP (English and Spanish combined) will increase CRC screening uptake in Hispanics and non-Hispanics (considered separately) via changes in the cognitive mediators. Methods: Randomized controlled trial of 2 groups, comparing a PT (to the cognitive mediators) CRC screening IMCP offered in both English and Spanish versions and deployed before a primary care office visit with a non-tailored ""electronic leaflet"" CRC screening IMCP (control) also offered in both English and Spanish. Screening methods targeted will be fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. Primary outcomes will be CRC screening uptake, self- efficacy, perceived barriers, and readiness. Implications: Our findings will determine whether an IMCP that is PT to cognitive mediators of screening behavior and deployed in primary care offices prior to previously scheduled visits can activate patients of various ethnicities to undergo CRC screening. They may also suggest a promising, portable method of reducing disparities in CRC (and other) screening uptake between Hispanic and non-Hispanic individuals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our findings will determine whether an interactive multimedia computer program that is personally-tailored to cognitive mediators of screening behavior and deployed in primary care offices prior to previously scheduled visits can activate patients of various ethnicities to undergo colorectal cancer screening. They may also suggest a promising, portable method of reducing disparities in colorectal cancer (and other) screening uptake between Hispanic and non-Hispanic individuals.          ",Tailored Interactive Multimedia to Reduce Colorectal CA Screening Disparities,8138479,R01CA131386,"['Colonoscopy ', ' English Language ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Computers ', ' primary outcome ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Cognitive ', ' uptake ', ' base ', ' preference ', ' Printing ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Visit ', ' Process ', ' trend ', ' improved ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Language ', ' Control Groups ', ' Training ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Electronics ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Behavior ', ' Schedule ', ' Communities ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Health behavior ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' laptop ', ' Mediating ', ' Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Flexible sigmoidoscopy ', ' Fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Clinical ', ' Work ', ' Staging ', ' Individual ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Patients ', ' Performance ', ' Methods ', ' Caring ', ' Address ', ' Knowledge ', ' Health ', ' Outcome ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Testing ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', "" Physicians' Offices "", ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' interactive multimedia ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2011,422150,0.1915500169361205
"Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening Rates in Community Health Centers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community health centers (CHCs) do not have the office systems in place to ensure that every eligible patient is offered colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. CHCs need evidence-based approaches to implementing office- system changes that take into account the substantial resource, staffing, and time constraints they face. Until this need is met, screening rates will likely remain low, putting thousands of minority, low-income, and uninsured patients at unnecessary risk. The long-term goal is to improve CRC screening rates in CHCs and in doing so, reduce cancer health disparities. The objective of this R21 application is to test the feasibility of an evidence-informed implementation strategy that combines an office-systems toolkit and outreach education. The rationale for the project, supported by preliminary data, is that CHCs want to increase CRC screening rates, but need evidence-based tools that-with training and technical assistance-they can implement and maintain more efficiently and effectively. Although the proposed implementation strategy is evidence-informed and promising, it is novel in the CHC setting and needs to be feasibility-tested in this challenging organizational context prior to larger-scale evaluation. This research study will pursue three specific aims: (1) assess the extent of implementation of office-system changes that promote CRC screening, using the CRC toolkit and outreach specialist; (2) estimate the costs of implementing and maintaining office-system changes, using the CRC toolkit and outreach specialist; (3) conduct a limited test of the office-system changes implemented, using the CRC toolkit and outreach specialist. For the first aim, interviews and surveys informed by a conceptual model of innovation implementation will be used to examine the number and type of office-system tools that CHCs implement, the amount and type of outreach support provided, and organizational factors predictive of implementation effectiveness. For the second aim, process maps, activity logs, and unit prices will be used to estimate the cost of implementing changes to the CRC screening process and calculate net benefit by comparing the costs and revenues of CRC screening processes pre- and post-implementation. For the third aim, changes in documented physician recommendation for screening and completed screenings will be assessed through chart audits pre- and post-implementation. This project is innovative in that it attempts to shift the current paradigm for making systems-based changes in CHCs from the quality improvement collaborative approach to one that promises greater feasibility given CHCs' resource constraints. The proposed research is significant because of its potential to improve public health by increasing CRC screening rates in minority, low income and insured populations and its contribution to scientific knowledge about how the office- systems approach works.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project is relevant to public health because an effective strategy for implementing office-system changes that uses fewer resources and achieves higher screening rates than current systems-based approaches could lead to the prevention or early detection of thousands of colorectal cancer cases annually among minority, low-income, and uninsured patients. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NCI's mission to conduct and fund research that improves early detection and diagnosis and reduces cancer disparities.           The proposed project is relevant to public health because an effective strategy for implementing office-system changes that uses fewer resources and achieves higher screening rates than current systems-based approaches could lead to the prevention or early detection of thousands of colorectal cancer cases annually among minority, low-income, and uninsured patients.

"Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. We will use the Pathways Framework, Community-Based Participatory Research process, and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to guide our approach to the intervention, community participation, and dissemination. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a CRC LHW + Media intervention in increasing CRC screening among Vietnamese Americans aged 50 to 74 who have never had a CRC screening test, 2) identify predictors of CRC screening, and 3) evaluate the process of community participation. Following formative research using a cognitive testing approach to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials and survey instruments, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial among Vietnamese Americans aged 50-74 in Santa Clara County California, who have never had a CRC screening test prior to recruitment. We will follow two longitudinal cohorts among whom we will conduct a pre-intervention survey of participants' knowledge, intention, and behavior as regards CRC screening; implement CRC screening educational sessions in an experimental group and nutrition educational sessions in a comparison group; and conduct a post-intervention survey. Each of the two cohorts will include 150 men and 150 women to have a total sample size of 600. The media intervention component will distribute Vietnamese-language health education materials through print and electronic media. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the frequency of screening using pre- and post-intervention surveys. To test our primary hypothesis regarding the effects of the intervention on screening activity, we will use Z-tests. We will also employ logistic regression models to test the effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for CRC screening. In addition, we will conduct process evaluation of the intervention and community participation. If this intervention is found to be effective, this LHW model could be applied in health promotion programs to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans and evaluated in other behavioral objectives and settings to reduce health disparities in other poor and underserved populations.

"Molecular Genetics of Colorectal Cancer Progression in a Diverse Patient Cohort    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of new cancer cases and cancer deaths in the United States. A pronounced disparity exists between African American and Caucasian American patients, with African Americans displaying both increased incidence and mortality rates. Although many factors play a role in this health disparity, several findings also suggest a role for tumor biology and genetics. MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 are proteins expressed by mismatch repair genes that are responsible for repairing nucleotide mispairs and small insertions or deletions caused by the DNA replication machinery. Prior studies have revealed that African Americans display a younger age at presentation, a higher incidence of proximal- located tumors and a higher prevalence of the microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, a phenotype commonly observed in Lynch Syndrome patients (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) and associated with loss of function of the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins. Based upon these findings, I hypothesize that increased alteration of mismatch repair genes in African American patients may account for the higher incidence of MSI-H tumors and, further, that both the frequency and spectrum of mismatch repair gene alterations may be distinct in African American patients. To evaluate this hypothesis, Brooke Sylvester proposes the following aims: aim 1) to analyze a cohort of colorectal cancer patients to determine if demographic factors correlate with tumor pathology, microsatellite instability status and survival, using immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue microarrays and microsatellite instability testing; aim 2) to compare the mutation spectrum and mutation or promoter hypermethylation frequency of mismatch repair genes in our patient population with those previously reported in other populations, using publicly available datasets; aim 3) to determine whether mismatch repair proteins play a role in the DNA damage-induced apoptotic response, utilizing RNA interference techniques to silence the expression of mismatch repair genes. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the molecular mechanisms leading to the distinct phenotype observed in African American colorectal cancer patients and how this may affect colorectal cancer progression. If this phenomenon plays a role in the increased incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer in African American patients, then this study will be relevant in identifying therapies that will reduce or eliminate the unequal burden of cancer in our society.             ",Molecular Genetics of Colorectal Cancer Progression in a Diverse Patient Cohort,8033117,F31CA136237,"['Tissue Microarray ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Cytotoxic agent ', ' Cytotoxic drug ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' Chicago ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ', ' Lynch Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, hPMS2) ', ' Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Defective Mismatch Repair Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Colorectal Endometrial Cancer Syndrome ', ' Familial Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Familial Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, hPMS2) ', ' MSH2 gene ', ' MSH2 ', ' FCC1 ', ' COCA1 ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' PMS2 gene ', ' PMSL2 ', ' PMS2 ', ' H_DJ0042M02.9 ', ' HNPCC4 ', ' DNA Mismatch Repair Gene Homologue ', ' MSH6 gene ', ' MSH6 ', ' HNPCC5 ', ' Hypermethylation ', ' Tumor Pathology ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Mutation Spectra ', ' Mismatch Repair ', ' Post-Replication Mismatch Repair ', ' Caucasians ', ' MLH1 gene ', ' hMLH1 ', ' MLH1 ', ' MGC5172 ', ' FCC2 ', ' COCA2 ', ' base ', ' Play ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Affect ', ' Apoptotic ', ' novel ', ' patient population ', ' Microsatellite Instability ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' DNA biosynthesis ', ' DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA Replication ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Medical center ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' loss of function ', ' Exhibits ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Accounting ', ' United States ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' response ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Genetic ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Molecular ', ' Age ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Incidence ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' cohort ', ' Techniques ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Phenotype ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencings ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencings ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencings ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Pattern ', ' Sampling ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' protein expression ', ' Defect ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Testing ', ' Patients ', ' Reporting ', ' Goals ', ' Mediating ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Universities ', ' tumor ', ' Societies ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Population ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2011,11015,0.09898273435373595
"Geographic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Survival    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. Despite declines in CRC incidence rates, survival following diagnosis has improved only modestly over the past few decades. Even though environmental contexts play an important role in health, disease, and behavior, most studies about CRC survival have largely ignored the geographic variation and importance of area-level socioeconomic conditions that have been associated with CRC screening, CRC stage at diagnosis, and with the survival of many other cancers. CRC patients who live in areas with worse socioeconomic conditions have decreased survival than those who live under more affluent conditions; however, the mechanisms by which these area-level factors exert their influence on CRC survival remain unclear. This amended application of the proposed population-based, prospective study has three specific aims. Aim 1) Determine the extent of the geographic variation of CRC survival across the United States based on small geographic areas at the sub-county (census-tract) level using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data for over 100,000 men and women aged 66 or older diagnosed with CRC. Aim 2) Determine the extent to which lower CRC survival can be explained by higher area socioeconomic deprivation among persons age 66 and older. Aim 3) Identify potential mediating pathways by which higher area socioeconomic deprivation is associated with lower CRC survival among persons age 66 and older, namely a) patient characteristics, b) physician and hospital characteristics, c) tumor characteristics, d) type of treatment received, and e) surveillance for CRC after diagnosis to detect recurrence and metastases. A multilevel spatial model will be developed to address the specific aims of the proposed study. We will use the following existing data sources: 1) 1992-2005 data from NCI's SEER program (survival, patient characteristics, type of treatment, tumor characteristics); 2) 1991-2005 Medicare data (patient characteristics, type of treatment, surveillance after diagnosis) which is linked to the SEER data; 3) 1991-2005 data from the Provider of Services File (hospital and physician characteristics), 4) 1990-2005 census data (area deprivation measures), and 5) Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data. Advanced Bayesian spatial analyses of CRC survival will be performed and a geographic information system will be used to display the results. Our study will increase understanding of and identify important mechanisms of the role of area-level socioeconomic deprivation on CRC survival. In addition, this study will help provide opportunities for targeting specific geographic areas to allocate resources and interventions locally to improve CRC survival using evidence- based approaches, thereby reducing health disparities associated with living in socioeconomically deprived areas.

"Training African American Peers as Patient Navigators for Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer health disparities related to race and ethnicity are among the most serious problems facing the US health care system. A recent Institute of Medicine report stated that such disparities are seen at every level of health care, from prevention to treatment and follow-up. This problem is acutely evident in the figures for colorectal cancer (CRC) among African Americans (AAs). According to the American Cancer Society, AAs have the highest CRC incidence and mortality of any ethnic/racial group. Indeed, CRC incidence and mortality are 15% and 43% higher among AAs than Whites, respectively. These disparities could be effectively reduced through greater AA participation in CRC screening and early detection. More importantly, due to the preponderance of CRC in AAs beyond the reach of the flexible sigmoidoscopy, increased adherence to colonoscopy among AAs will save lives. Although there is clear evidence that providing patients with someone to help them manage/navigate the health care system (i.e., patient navigation (PN)) is effective in helping them to complete cancer screening, very few hospitals provide PN for colonoscopy. The vast majority of hospitals in NYC are unable to provide PN for patients for whom colonoscopy is recommended, in large part because of the costs associated with professional-led PN. The proposed R-25E seeks to address this serious public health problem by investigating the success of training AAs who have undergone colonoscopy to serve as peer patient navigators to help others from their community complete CRC screening via colonoscopy.       The proposed training plan is supported by seven distinct lines of evidence: 1) research indicating a 76-90% reduction in CRC mortality through colonoscopy, 2) the success of PN in increasing participation in health promotion, 3) data from the NYC Department of Health showing underuse of PN for colonoscopy, 4) research demonstrating increased credibility of peers in providing health information, 5) research on volunteer-led health education interventions, 6) the cost savings we found in our preliminary research on peer led PN (PPN) for colonoscopy, and 7) our success in promoting cancer screening and preventative health care practices in AA communities of New York City through our collaboration with community leaders and church groups.       The overall goal of the proposed R-25E is to reduce CRC morbidity and mortality by increasing AA participation in colonoscopy in a cost effective way. This will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) The development and implementation of a training program for Peer Patient Navigation (PPN) to increase participation of AAs in colonoscopy; 2) The examination of the cost effectiveness of the PPN training program in completion of colonoscopy from the perspective of AAs for whom colonoscopy is recommended; and 3) The investigation of the relative cost effectiveness of the PPN training program from the perspective of hospitals.                   ",Training African American Peers as Patient Navigators for Colon Cancer Screening,8116074,R25CA132692,"['cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Tape Recording ', ' Church ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' peer ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Schedule ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Paper ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Training Programs ', ' Data ', ' cost ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Reporting ', ' Woman ', ' Incidence ', ' Training ', ' Hospitals ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Supervision ', ' Policies ', ' Goals ', ' volunteer ', ' Address ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Investigation ', ' Age ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Collaborations ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Outcome ', ' Role playing therapy ', ' role playing (psychodrama) ', ' Role Playing ', ' Patients ', ' base ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Research ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' success ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Work ', ' Communities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Evaluation ', ' Funding ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Institution ', ' Prevention ', ' Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Flexible sigmoidoscopy ', ' Fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' skill acquisition ', ' Review Literature ', ' Cost Savings ', ' New York City ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R25,2011,320667,0.063774931631833
"Tailored Touchscreen Colorectal Cancer Prevention in American Indian Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality disproportionately impacts minorities.  Few studies have addressed screening among specific minority populations such as American Indians (AI).  This study will assess the efficacy of a novel tailored touch screen computer intervention based on an innovative integration of the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) and the concept of ""implementation intentions,"" a recent elaboration of the Theory of Planned Behavior.  The majority of the intervention will be delivered in tribal clinics and primary care settings on low-cost touch screen computers through multimedia audio-narrative and video messages.  Studies have not tested the effectiveness of culturally tailored communications specified to stated ""implementation intentions"" for improving CRC screening in this group.  A randomized design will test a comparison condition of generic information versus a  multimedia tailored intervention that specifically addresses each participant's screening test modality  preference, current CRC screening decisional stage (PAPM), and CRC screening ""implementation  intentions"" (the ""when"", ""where"" and ""how"" details of screening).  Behavioral intervention materials will be developed with the help of cultural experts, a pilot test, and from data gathered in a prior focus group study we used to assess key influences on CRC screening for AIs.  The study will be conducted with 460 AI patients eligible for CRC screening and recruited while presenting for care in tribal or regional safety-net clinics.  All participants will receive a baseline touch screen administered assessment and, depending on stated preference, be offered either an immunochemical fecal occult blood test (iFOBT-InSure TM) or colonoscopy.  Participants will be randomized to either C (comparison group-computer  delivered generic CRC information) or AI2 (active intervention-computer delivered culturally tailored  messaging based on individual PAPM stage, behavior constructs, and ""Implementation Intentions"").  A brief office exit survey will assess patient-provider discussions of CRC screening and satisfaction with computerized message materials.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal Cancer is a major cause of cancer mortality and late stage presentation is common among minorities. American Indians, receive colorectal cancer screening at very low rates and face important cultural barriers to care in the health care system.

"CBPR Strategies to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Ohio Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): a disproportionate burden of CRC incidence and mortality, mainly due to lower utilization of recommended CRC screening tests. The Appalachian region of Ohio suffers from this burden of disease in addition to higher poverty, lower employment, and lower educational levels. To address this cancer health disparity, our health disparities research team at The Ohio State University (OSU) in partnership with four Appalachia-based community coalitions have used community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods to design and pilot test two interventions intended to increase CRC screening rates in one Appalachian county (Phase 1).  The goal of this application is to test these CRC screening interventions in 12 Ohio Appalachian counties (Phase 2) in preparation for a full-scale dissemination trial (Phase 3) in 6 additional Appalachian states within the Appalachia Community Cancer Network (ACCN).      The specific aims of this Phase 2 proposal are to: 1) utilize CBPR methods to refine specific county-level media campaigns and clinic-based messages about CRC screening (entitled ""Get Behind Your Health!"") or an attention control message (a healthy eating campaign entitled ""PEACHES"") in 12 Ohio Appalachia counties; 2) implement and test, using a group-randomized design, a staggered county-wide intervention program that compares county-specific media campaigns featuring local CRC survivors, clinic-specific charter reminder systems, and a combination of the two strategies in 6 randomly selected intervention counties to the same campaign strategies in 6 randomly selected attention control counties using county specific healthy eating campaigns featuring local farmers and educational material placed in clinics; 3) utilize process (convenience samples of county residents) and outcome evaluation (4 independent cross-sectional surveys of residents of each county) strategies to assess the efficacy of each strategy on improving CRC screening rates; and 4) utilize the results, to plan the dissemination of the intervention into 36 Appalachian counties in 6 additional states of the ACCN in a subsequent Phase 3 study.      All specific aims will be carried out using CBPR principles, in full partnership with these four Ohio Appalachian community-based cancer coalitions, and will be guided by an underlying theoretical framework of the Transtheoretical Model, in conjunction with three behavioral theories relevant to behavior change (Social Cognitive Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action, and Attitude Accessibility Theory).  The results of this study, thus, will have immediate impact in these Appalachian counties, as the community will be able to institutionalize successful strategies into existing county-wide health campaigns.          ",CBPR Strategies to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Ohio Appalachia,8034377,R24MD002785,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Poverty ', ' behavior change ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Ohio ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' County ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Incidence ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' farmer ', ' base ', ' Employment ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Media Campaign ', ' dissemination trial ', ' theories ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' United States ', ' Health ', ' Evaluation ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Survival Rate ', ' design ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Preparation ', ' Attitude ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' cancer type ', ' Clinic ', ' Attention ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' phase 3 study ', ' Phase III study ', ' intervention program ', ' Phase ', ' Modeling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Goals ', ' Woman ', ' designing ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Behavioral ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Universities ', ' Research ', ' improved ', ' Testing ', ' Communities ', ' Modality ', ' Sampling ', ' Outcome ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' ']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2011,578427,0.18648440451113946
"Community Context of Colorectal Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates are far below recommendations by the US Preventive Services Task Force. Among the nearly 100 million adults aged 50 or older in the United States, less than 50% have ever had a screening endoscopy (Shapiro et al., 2008). A further concern is that the screening rate for minority and low socioeconomic groups is even lower (Doubeni et al., 2009; Johnson-Kozlow, et al., 2009). These disparities are not explained away by individual coverage of health insurance. Instead, there is speculation that a complex combination of socioeconomic disadvantage and place of residence may contribute to these persistent disparities in screening (Christie, et al., 2009; Doubeni et al., 2009; Henry, Niu, Boscoe, 2009). An emerging area of interest in public health in general-and cancer screening in particular-is the effect that contextual forces may play in shaping use of health care services (Arcury et al., 2005; Hiscock et al., 2008; Onega et al., 2008). A better understanding of the role of other contextual barriers to screening-such as the supply of medical resources-may not only be important for understanding the barriers to colorectal cancer screening, but may also be more amenable to policy interventions (e.g., these types of barriers fit within current health care reform efforts). The research we are proposing will provide a basis for understanding the contextual factors impacting colorectal cancer screening, as well as new insights on the role of factors that contribute to disparities in CRC screening. Data from this study can be used to develop strategies to increase colorectal cancer screening and reduce disparities. Our first aim will identify community level barriers for colorectal cancer screening including demographic characteristics, medical resource supply, and insurance market. Our second aim will determine which community level barriers contribute to race/ethnic disparities in colorectal cancer screening. To address the specific aims, analysis will be performed on secondary data from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Cancer Control Module linked with the 2007 Area Resource File (ARF). NHIS is a population-based survey of individuals, and ARF is a collection of county level data. NHIS was collected under statutory authority that requires strict protection of respondent confidentiality. To maintain confidentiality, public versions of these data do not contain aggregate level identifiers. To facilitate access to contextually linked files, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) has established research data centers. NCHS will link the NHIS and ARF through the Research Data Center. Access to a contextual-link file for these data sets requires application to NCHS and investigator guarantees to maintain confidentiality.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer screening may be perceived to be unpleasant, embarrassing, frightening, and time- consuming, and this perception is a major barrier relative to other types of preventive screening and likely among the major reasons that colorectal cancer screening is far below recommended levels. Aside from improved technology that would reduce the time and unpleasantness of the procedure, public health officials are left with identifying and removing as many other barriers to screening as possible. Factors related to the structure and organization of the community not only contribute to disparities in colorectal cancer deaths, but an advantage of focusing on community level characteristics is that they might be better able to ameliorate population wide disparities in colorectal cancer compared to individual level interventions for patients and providers.        PROJECT NARRATIVE Public health officials are trying to identify and remove as many barriers to colorectal cancer screening as possible. Availability of medical resources such as facilities and doctors is a proximal barrier to screening that may be more amenable to policy intervention than other types of system wide factors such as poverty or segregation. This study will produce findings that will describe objective characteristics of the environment that can be acted upon by administrators and policy makers to increase the use of colorectal cancer screening.",Community Context of Colorectal Cancer Disparities,8309719,R03CA150486,"['National Health Interview Survey ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' community organizations ', ' Ambulatory Surgical Procedures ', ' Outpatient Surgery ', ' Ambulatory Surgery ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Endoscopy ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Respondent ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Gastroenterologist ', ' Love ', ' medical supply ', ' Public Policy ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' residence ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Insurance ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Hospitals ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Time ', ' Population ', ' improved ', ' Structure ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Play ', ' Individual ', ' Data ', ' Link ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Incidence ', ' authority ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' base ', ' Communities ', ' Research ', ' meetings ', ' Complex ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Area ', ' Reporting ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Address ', ' Recommendation ', ' Procedures ', ' Health care facility ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Characteristics ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Minority ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Provider ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Shapes ', ' interest ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Technology ', ' Policies ', ' Services ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Behavior ', ' insight ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Medical ', ' Administrator ', ' aged ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Environment ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Health ', ' Learning ', ' Preventive ', ' Marketing ', ' Confidentiality ', ' information privacy ', ' population based ', ' Probability ', ' County ', ' Collection ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Poverty ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' public health relevance ', ' Left ', ' United States ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' National Center for Health Statistics (U.S.) ', ' United States National Center for Health Statistics ', ' National Center for Health Statistics ', ' NCHS ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Preventive screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2011,46620,0.20583041102934657
"Cancer Control Dissemination to Asian Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of our proposal is to disseminate an evidence-based intervention designed for one Asian ethnic population to a different Asian ethnic population with overlapping cultural and health beliefs. In collaboration with International Community Health Services (ICHS), a community agency serving many Asian ethnic groups, we have three specific objectives for the proposed research:  Replicate an effective colorectal cancer (CRC) screening intervention for Vietnamese Americans that was originally designed for Chinese Americans.  Evaluate the dissemination of this replicated intervention through a quasi-experimental study.  Collect and examine dissemination process data. Based on principles from Diffusion of Innovation Theory, we proposed to replicate an intervention with a 42% effect size. The replicated intervention will consist of a Vietnamese language video and bilingual pamphlet. We will translate and dub into Vietnamese our award-winning Chinese-language video, ""Being a Winner in Life: How to Prevent Colorectal Cancer."" The Chinese/English pamphlet will also be translated into Vietnamese. To provide feedback on the translated video script and pamphlet, we will convene 4 focus groups with Vietnamese men and women. Subsequently, we will introduce these materials to the intervention clinic staff at in-service training presentations and specifically recommend that intervention clinic medical assistants distribute the intervention materials. To evaluate the dissemination of this replicated intervention, our quantitative analysis will examine the Reach and Effectiveness based on the RE-AIM framework through a quasi-experimental study over an 18-month period. There are 919 and 802 age-eligible Vietnamese patients at the intervention and control clinic respectively. To determine the Effectiveness of the intervention, the primary outcome will be changes in CRC screening adherence rates at the intervention and control clinics. We will randomly select 25% of the patients from each clinic for pre- and post-intervention chart audits and use the Generalized Estimating Equation to model CRC screening adherence at the two clinics at pre- and post-intervention. Process evaluation will examine Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance at the intervention clinic. We will collect qualitative data from 10 key informant interviews with ICHS management personnel and intervention clinic staff. In addition, 3 focus groups with medical assistants, the intervention agents, anof two focus groups with Vietnamese patients at the intervention clinic will also be completed.           ",Cancer Control Dissemination to Asian Americans,8134288,R01CA124397,"['ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Chinese American ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Vietnam ', ' Viet Nam ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' population health ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Methods ', ' Award ', ' post intervention ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Testing ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Translating ', ' primary outcome ', ' Maintenance ', ' Reporting ', ' International ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' migration ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' base ', ' Medical ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Research ', ' Process ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Interview ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Services ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experience ', ' Life ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' interest ', ' Clinic ', ' theories ', ' Patients ', ' Literature ', ' Pattern ', ' Individual ', ' Language ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Communities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Adoption ', ' Feedback ', ' Modeling ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' programs ', ' Population ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' American ', ' Country ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' informant ', ' Immigrant ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' effective intervention ', ' Equation ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' dissemination research ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' patient population ', ' evidence base ', ' Diffusion ', ' computerized data processing ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' Personnel Management ', ' Korea ', ' Training ', ' Age ', ' Funding ', ' Goals ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Woman ', ' Minority ', ' Evaluation ', ' Japan ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Philosophy ', ' Community Health Services ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' implementation research ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2011,71568,0.14292404996716015
"Colon cancer disparity elimination: a faith-based participatory partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elimination of the glaring colorectal cancer-related disparities in African Americans (AA) IS POSSIBLE. In this community based participatory research project (CPBR), we address both the SUPPLY and DEMAND components of the solution. Employing the community consultants and physicians successfully trained in Phase I, we have an adequate provider base to satisfy the increased demand resulting from this faith oriented barrier-free colonoscopy screening initiative. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is predominately preventable through screening for and removal of precancerous polyps. Unfortunately every year over 50,000 Americans of all races die unnecessarily. Multiple barriers result in an unacceptable disparity in both incidence and mortality for the AA, with the result that the death rate for AA males with advanced CRC cancer is double that for white males. The discovery of the evolution of CRC from benign polyps gives physicians ample time to remove the offending tissue prior to the development of cancers. The importance for screening in the AA population is accentuated by the documented shorter interval from the appearance of a polyp until its malignant transformation. We also know that colonoscopy is the ""gold standard."" The current capacity for performing colonoscopy is far below what is needed to screen the at-risk population as recent data reveals that only one-third of the appropriate population is compliant. In addition to capacity issues, many barriers to screening are patient related characteristics such as knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, cultural and ethnic issues, acceptability of screening method(s), ability to pay, and other socioeconomic and environmental issues (i.e. transportation, stigma, social support, etc.). Although over 80% of colonoscopies are provided by gastroenterologists, less than 4% in training are AA, fostering a growing gap in culturally competent colonoscopy providers. Using a triangulated theoretical framework including the Health Belief Model, the Social Cognitive Theory and the RE-AIM Evaluation model, we will further demonstrate a successful solution to addressing both SUPPLY (capacity for colorectal screening) and DEMAND (targeted patient access to and utilization of colorectal screening). The Phase I study confirmed that compliance can be achieved comparable to that for breast cancer screening (75%).

"The Impact of a Targeted CRC Screening Intervention among Latinos in Central PA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely recognized that colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most preventable cancers. If adenomatous polyps detected by screening were removed before they transformed into cancers, a decrease in new CRCs and in related mortality would follow. Unfortunately, cancer screening rates are low throughout Appalachia, including for Latino residents in PA. Further, Latinos are more likely to be diagnosed at later stage than Whites, have a lower survival rate and less access to quality treatment. Our long-term goal is to increase CRC screening uptake among Latinos in urban and rural central Pennsylvania (PA). Our central hypothesis is that a targeted CRC screening intervention can increase uptake over a non-targeted approach for this population. The specific objectives of the current proposal are to develop, implement and evaluate a targeted CRC screening intervention to increase CRC screening uptake. We will measure actual CRC uptake in both the control and intervention arm as a method to determinate completion rates. To prepare for my K01 application during my post-doc training, I led the design, implementation, and analysis of a CRC-related Latino study that provided preliminary data for theK01 work. In 04/09, utilizing the ACCN coalitions in PA, I conducted eight focus groups (FG) to identify barriers to CRC screenings among Latinos. We identified several substantial barriers to CRC screening for this population, including a significant barrier heretofore unmentioned in literature related to CRC screenings. Spanish-speaking patients want to have family members or close friends in the doctor office and health-related education classes. This barrier was reported across all groups and likely links to the desire for a strong social support that influences their CRC screening behavior. Another finding is that urban residents had some prior knowledge of risk factors associated with CRC screening while rural residents reported no prior knowledge and were unable to list any associated CRC risk factor. A high acceptability of the provider-recommended take-home fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for these Latinos was also reported. We exceeded our study recruitment goal. The same partnered Latino leaders are committed to the K01 proposed work. The K01 study design is a randomized, community-based, participatory design to determine completion of a provider-recommended, take-home FIT kit without (control) and with social support (intervention) among a sample of average-risk, urban and rural Appalachian Latino adults age 50 and older not currently adherent to national CRC screening guidelines (N=264).Each consented participant will attend a one-time, community- based CRC screening educational program offered at one of the eight study sites located in Central PA. The proposal is innovative because it combines provider-recommended FIT screening test with an education program and social support for Latinos in a randomized, community-based participatory research design. Further, it will provide preliminary data for evidence-based methods to increase CRC screening rates among Latinos throughout Appalachia, the focus of a future NIH NC1 R-series grant application.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In an effort to reduce this ethnic disparity among Latinos, screening rates among this population must increase. The specific objectives of the current proposal are to develop, implement and evaluate a multi-component targeted colorectal cancer (CRC) screening intervention to increase CRC screening uptake.

"Colorectal cancer risk after colonoscopy in elderly diabetes patient and men    DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. Colonoscopy is widely used to screen for CRC. Current guidelines recommend screening colonoscopy once every 10 years in average risk patients over >50 year who have no polyps identified at colonoscopy (i.e., negative colonoscopy). However, the prevalence of CRC and polyps increase with age. In addition, nearly 1/4 of the U.S. population over 60 years of age have diabetes mellitus (DM). Recent data suggest patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have an increased risk of CRC. Furthermore, population-based cancer incidence data have consistently suggested a higher incidence of CRC among men vs. women, and the disparity is most striking among those >65 years. Hence, the negative predictive value of a negative colonoscopy may be lower in patients >65 years who are male or have DM. As a result, there is uncertainty whether the recommended 10-year interval between screening colonoscopies in whom no polyps were identified should apply to elderly men or elderly DM patients. We hypothesize that among patients over the age of 65, the risk of CRC following a negative colonoscopy is higher in men vs. women, and in DM patients vs. non-DM patients. To test this hypothesis, we have designed a population-based cohort study using the linked SEERMedicare   data. The study will determine among the SEER-Medicare population, 1) whether men who have   undergone a negative colonoscopy have a higher subsequent incidence of CRC than women with a   negative colonoscopy; 2) whether DM patients who have undergone a negative colonoscopy have a higher subsequent incidence of CRC than non-DM patients with a negative colonoscopy; 3) whether men or DM patients who have undergone a negative colonoscopy have a lower incidence of CRC than the general SEER-Medicare population who have not undergone colonoscopy and whether the lower incidence persists for up to 10 years; 4) determine the absolute incidence by time of CRC following a colonoscopy without polyps for men, women, all patients with diabetes, men with diabetes, and women with diabetes. Both relative and absolute risks will be examined during the follow-up period. Subgroup analysis will examine the risk for proximal colon cancer and the combined effect of male sex and DM.      Relevance to Public Health: CRC is a common cause of death among the elderly population. Screening for colorectal cancer can reduce the risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality. Given the increased incidence of CRC in elderly male patients or elderly DM patients, it is important to determine whether the recommended 10-year interval between colonoscopies without polyps offers adequate protection to these high risk groups. Our study will help establish the appropriate time interval for elderly men and elderly DM patients to undergo a second colonoscopy following a negative colonoscopy so that they will not be facing an unacceptably high rate of preventable CRC morbidity and mortality.           Given the increased incidence of CRC in elderly male patients or elderly DM patients, it is important to determine whether the recommended 10-year interval between colonoscopies without polyps offers adequate protection to these high risk groups.

"Understanding Mechanisms of Ethnic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a rich literature documenting racial and ethnic disparities in the trajectory of cancer care and outcomes. Through analyses of tumor registry and Medicare data, the Principal Investigator and co-investigators have begun to uncover explanatory mechanisms or pathways underlying such disparities. We and others have identified disparities in survival after a diagnosis of cancer, much of which can be explained by delays in diagnosis leading to more advanced stage at diagnosis, and also by less than adequate treatment. There has also been considerable research on patient-level, physician level, and system- level factors that contribute to disparities in the trajectory of care. In this application we will conduct explanatory analyses with Medicare claims data to identify the mechanisms underlying racial disparities in stage of diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC), with a focus on the role of CRC screening among older adults. We will also develop methods to measure the performance of individual primary care physicians in providing CRC screening for patients. Of particular interest is how individual physicians' performance contributes to racial disparities in screening use. Aim 1: Determine the rate of screening for colorectal cancer in black and white men and women 65- 75 enrolled in fee for service Medicare in Michigan, New Jersey and Texas from 2001 through 2007. Aim 2: Determine the effect of other subject level (predisposing, enabling, and need) and environment level characteristics of CRC screening and determine the effect of continuity of care with a primary care physician (PCP) on receipt of CRC screening. Aim 3: Describe the variation among PCPs in use of CRC screening and determine how much of the race disparity in CRC screening is explained by PCP as opposed to patient characteristics. Aim 4: Examine the effects of provider characteristics (years in practice, age, volume of cases, primary specialty board certification, affiliation with academic medical centers, etc.) and medical system characteristics (PCPs per capita, gastroenterologists per capita) on the likelihood of CRC screening and also stratified by subjects' race. There are a number of options available to Medicare to promote health and reduce health disparities among its beneficiaries. The results of the mechanistic analyses in this application will allow for the design of interventions targeting the specific points in the trajectory of care that contribute to ethnic disparities in CRC screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the U.S., colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most frequently diagnosed but second leading cause of death among cancers. We will study Medicare data to understand better the reasons for racial disparities in CRC screening rates. With this information, Medicare will be able to design and implement interventions to promote health and reduce health disparities among its beneficiaries.          ",Understanding Mechanisms of Ethnic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Screening,8073119,R01CA134275,"['Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' effective intervention ', ' Michigan ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Provider ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Modality ', ' aged ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Staging ', ' Persons ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Specialty Boards ', ' Policies ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Caring ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Individual ', ' Address ', ' Medical ', ' Health ', ' Performance ', ' New Jersey ', ' Communities ', ' Woman ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Measures ', ' experience ', ' Research ', ' Goals ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Data ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' social ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' interest ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' programs ', ' Physicians ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Procedures ', ' improved ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Characteristics ', ' Methods ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Work ', ' Time ', ' Literature ', ' base ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Outcome ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Patients ', ' Environment ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' ethnic difference ', ' cancer care ', ' Gastroenterologist ', ' beneficiary ', ' tumor registry ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Board Certification ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Poverty ', ' Native Americans ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Texas ', ' Records ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R01,2011,191143,0.27898437644292134
"Genetic Association Studies in African American Colorectal Cancer Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant cause of cancer morbidity and mortality affecting almost 150,000 Americans yearly. African Americans have the highest CRC incidence and mortality of all US populations. These disparities have not been explained, and biological risk factors including genetic susceptibility to CRC are understudied in African Americans. I am a gastroenterologist who seeks to develop a career as an independent translational physician-scientist in CRC genetics. My long-term career goals require me to obtain additional training in: 1) molecular and statistical genetics; and 2) cancer biology. The 5-year career development program described in this application will take place at the University of Chicago which distinguishes itself in the field of human and cancer genetics especially in admixed populations. I am fortunate to have key collaborators at the University of North Carolina and the University of Illinois Chicago, and together we have DNA from over 1000 African American CRC patients and 1000 African American control subjects available for my proposed study. Dr. Nancy Cox, Professor of Medicine and Chief of Human Genetics, is my mentor and will provide expertise in statistical genetics. Dr. Nathan Ellis, Associate Professor of Medicine, is a co-mentor and will provide expertise in CRC molecular genetics. An inter-disciplinary Advisory Committee comprised of Dr. Rick Kittles, an expert in genetics of admixed populations, Dr. Olufunmilayo Olopade, an internationally recognized leader in cancer genetics, and Dr. Eugene Chang, a successful physician-scientist in gastroenterology, will guide and advise me during this development period. The broad objectives of this research proposal are the identification of genetic susceptibility factors that contribute to risk of CRC development in African Americans. I will study single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered using genome-wide association studies in European populations. Regions containing these SNP are likely to harbor functional variants. African Americans are an ideal population in whom to identify functional variants because their genomes exhibit less linkage disequilibrium. To this end, I propose three specific aims: 1) Validate candidate CRC-associated regions in African American cases and controls; 2) Discover novel SNPs in CRC-associated regions by targeted resequencing using next-generation sequencing technologies; and 3) Identify putative functional variants in candidate CRC-associated regions that can be further evaluated in future functional studies. By the end of my career development period, I will be uniquely equipped to undertake further translational research in CRC genetics. My long-term research goals are to understand genetic susceptibility in CRC pathogenesis and to study how genetic susceptibility factors can be used to risk stratify individuals for CRC screening and thereby prevent disease especially in high risk but understudied populations like African Americans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of all US populations, African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer.

"Effectiveness of Screening Colonoscopy in Reducing Deaths from Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers of the colon and rectum (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the US, can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques. Although some expert groups in the US consider colonoscopy to be the standard, there is currently only limited direct evidence to support its increasing use for screening in average risk adults. Colonoscopy has higher risks and costs than other screening tests. Recent studies reported that colonoscopy did not reduce mortality from right-sided colon cancers, the part of the colon that is beyond the reach of sigmoidoscopy. However, those findings were controversial because that study was unable to distinguish screening from diagnostic uses or accurately assess the completeness of colonoscopies. This project's goal is to inform clinical and policy decisions by providing evidence to show whether the purported benefits of colonoscopy are realized in practice. The primary specific aim is to estimate the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy in reducing death from CRC among average-risk adults when compared to no screening, overall and separately for right- and left-sided cancers. Our secondary aims are to: 1) determine the impact of the completeness of colonoscopy examinations on its effectiveness; and 2) compare the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy relative to sigmoidoscopy. We will use a case-control design nested in an historical cohort of persons receiving care at 3 sites participating in a research consortium, Cancer Research Network (CRN). These sites provide the full continuum of cancer care to their members ranging from screening through end of life care, and provide access to information on CRC screening that can be linked to diagnosis and cause-specific mortality data on large numbers of racially and socioeconomically diverse persons. We will identify at least 1,200 cases of CRC deaths between 2007 and 2014 among enrollees who were 52 years or older at the date of the diagnosis, each matched within each health plan to two randomly selected controls based on age, sex and enrollment history. We will identify screening history for a minimum of 10 years prior to cancer diagnosis, differentiating screening from diagnostic procedures, using standardized targeted chart reviews and other sources. The sample size will provide sufficient power for separate evaluations of tumors located in the right colon. This project will be carried out by an experienced interdisciplinary team representing epidemiology, case-control methodology, biostatistics, gastroenterology and primary care. Team members are national leaders in CRC screening research and policy. This project is in synergy with existing NCI and the CRN goals to: 1) develop methods and approaches to provide clinical, policy-relevant information; and 2) inform clinical and public health decisions on CRC screening. This application is also responsive to the NCI's priority to improve understanding of the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of tests used in screening for CRC, a ""health disparity condition"", and addresses Healthy People 2010 goals to reduce cancer death.

"Identification of Significant Race Associated Colon Cancer Drive Gene Mutations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the Program Announcement - Exploratory/Developmental Grants Program for Basic Research in Cancer Health Disparities. PA Number: PAR-09-160. The grant proposal is entitled: 'Identification of Significant Race Associated Colon Cancer Driver Gene Mutations'. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that patterns of driver gene [CAN gene] mutations differ among colon cancers arising in individuals of different race, reflecting at the molecular level differences in disease epidemiology, lifestyle, and environmental exposures among these groups. CRC is one of the common cancers with significant disparities attributed to racial/ethnic etiologic factors. African Americans have a significantly higher incidence of morbidity and mortality caused by CRC than the Caucasian population. Tumor CAN gene mutation profiles are directly related to cancer progression and clinical behavior in virtually all cancer systems. Our recent identification of the 140 CRC CAN genes and our ability to molecularly stratify CRC patients in terms of racial heritage - as well as using patient self-declared status - places us in a unique position to look at the influence of race on this fundamental aspect of cancer biology. Furthermore we have developed the ability to assess the influence of a patient's ancestry on individual tumor CAN gene mutations. The aim of this proposal will be to sequence the 140 CAN genes in a matched set of CRCs from African Americans and Caucasians. These patients will be initially stratified by self-declared race. Furthermore, these patients will be reclassified based on each individual's African and European Ancestry Informative Markers. These studies are enabled by a number of different efforts by our group. We have constructed a large, well-annotated, biorepository containing colon cancer tissue specimens from patients treated at a large medical center over the last 20 years. The majority of these specimens are formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues [FFPE]. Over the last few years we worked to develop sophisticated approaches to enhance the reliability of DNA extraction from FFPE materials. In tandem with these efforts we developed an infrastructure and knowledge base to support high throughput sequencing such as envisioned in this proposal. This includes the acquisition of a 'Next Generation' sequencer and hiring of faculty members to further extend the depth of expertise in this area at our institution. This proposal has the potential to significantly advance the understanding of the effects of racial/ethnic predisposition in cancers overall and in CRC - the second most common human cancer.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans disproportionately suffer excess morbidity and mortality from most forms of cancer compared to the population at large.

"Adding Hispanics to Ongoing GWAS in Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been instrumental in identifying a number of common susceptibility loci in Non Hispanic (NH)-White populations and a NCI priority is to extend GWAS findings to other populations to address racial/ethnic disparities in cancer susceptibility. Currently, GWA studies of CRC in NH-Whites, Japanese and African-Americans are ongoing. We propose a complementary study to address this critical research area in Hispanics. Hispanics represent the fastest growing ethnic population in the U.S. and have been largely understudied in terms of genetic susceptibility to cancer. There are noted differences in incidence, survival and mortality in CRC by ethnic/racial groups. Hispanics often present with CRC at a younger age and have a significantly greater incidence of stage IV tumors or metastatic disease compared to NH-Whites. We propose to conduct a large, cost-efficient, population-based GWAS in Hispanics by building upon existing NIH-funded resources, the Colon Cancer Family Registry (Colon CFR) and the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC). We plan to recruit 2,500 Hispanic men and women diagnosed with CRC between 01/2010 to 10/2013 using cancer registries in California. Risk factor/diet questionnaires, pathology reports, Oragene buccal samples (for genotyping) and tumor blocks (for MSI testing) will be collected using methodologies developed in the Colon CFR/MEC. Cases of CRC in the MEC (currently 473; anticipated 600 at end) will also be included. Population-based Hispanic individuals without a diagnosis of CRC participating in other GWA studies in the MEC (n=3,900, U01HG004726, Haiman) will be used as controls. We will genotype all 3,100 cases using the Illumina 1M array and use available genotype and epidemiologic data collected on 3,900 controls. Our statistical analyses will include: single-SNP and haplotype effects, gene-environment interactions and heterogeneity by MSI, tumor subtype and family history of CRC. We will replicate findings in a second-stage using CRC cases and controls from Mexico (1,000 cases and 1,000 controls, EU FP7 funding, CHIBCHA, Carvajal-Carmona/Tomlinson). We will also examine heterogeneity of the risk estimates by ethnicity/race by leveraging GWA data on NH-Whites (2,142 cases, 1,909 controls, U01 CA122839, Casey), (4,000 cases, 6,000 NH-White controls, UK-CHIBCHA, Tomlinson), Colombians (2,000 cases and 2,000 controls, CHIBCHA), Japanese (1,000 cases and 1,000 controls) and African-Americans (1,500 cases and 1,500 controls, R01CA126895, Le Marchand). We will genotype replicated significant SNPs in our main and combined analysis in several Hispanic populations (note: studies funded by EU or NIH for data collection but not GWAS) including: 800 Puerto Ricans, 2,000 Brazilians, 2,000 Argentineans and 3,000 Spanish/Portuguese to assess generalizability of findings. This study will have a high impact by addressing the key question of racial/ethnic disparities related to genetic susceptibility to CRC, and will enable further growth and investment into research among Hispanics by providing a resource of genetic data and biospecimens, which is lacking.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to conduct a large population-based study to understand the role of the human genome in the etiology of colorectal cancer among Hispanics. The Hispanic population is the fastest growing ethnic population in the U.S. We also propose to investigate differences in genetic effects on risk of colorectal cancer across multiple races/ethnicities including Non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, Japanese and African-Americans. This study will address an important gap in genome-wide association studies of colorectal cancer in Hispanics and be able to evaluate differences in cancer susceptibility in different ethnic/racial groups.            We propose to conduct a large population-based study to understand the role of the human genome in the etiology of colorectal cancer among Hispanics.

"Reducing cancer disparities:  Incident cancer after colonoscopies by primary care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project explores a key knowledge gap regarding the quality and colorectal cancer (CRC) protection effect of primary care physician (PCP)-performed colonoscopies under a innovative program in South Carolina that trains and utilizes primary care physicians (PCP) for colonoscopy screening. The program uses a unique clinical protocol, with inbuilt quality safeguards to compensate for PCPs' lack of formal gastroenterology training. A previous NCI-funded study documented the high quality and patient safety of PCP-performed colonoscopies, providing the evidence base for the clinical effectiveness of PCP-colonoscopies performed in a structured setting. The same study also found significantly higher colonoscopy rates among patients of trained AA PCPs relative to untrained PCPs, an increase that was led by drastic increases among AAs, particularly AA men. Though promising, questions remain to be addressed before this innovative program can be scaled up to expand colonoscopy access for AAs. The questions are: a) Do PCPs' adenoma/cancer yield rates and procedure performance indicators match those of specialists performing colonoscopies in the same clinical setting and screening patients drawn from the same population? This study aim will clarify the performance quality of PCP-colonoscopies accounting for potential confounding due to unobserved population-related variables. b) Do PCPs confer similar CRC protection rates as specialists serving the same population, and do PCP-cohort protection rates compare well with the CRC protection rates found in randomized clinical trials?  This study will investigate these questions using data on 13,688 screening colonoscopies by 54 PCPs and on 5031 colonoscopies by 5 specialists. To detect differences in performance quality and case yield rates we will compare PCP-performed procedures with specialist-performed procedures on the following metrics: a) polyp detection rate and mean polyps detected per patient, b) adenoma detection rate and mean adenomas per patient, c) advanced adenoma detection rate and mean per patient, d) cancer detection rate, e) location of detected adenomas - right-sided, left-sided and cecal adenomas, f) colonoscope insertion and withdrawal times when no polyp was found and when polyp(s) were found, g) cecal intubation rate, h) reasons for incomplete colonoscopies (not achieving cecal intubation), i) repeat colonoscopy due to unsatisfactory procedure, and j) all of the above indicators classified by PCPs' training status and procedure volume. To satisfy study aim 2 we will assess the number and type of incident cancers among PCP- vs. specialist-served cohorts (65,685 person years (PYO) from 13,688 PCP colonoscopies, and 34,255 PYOs from the 5031 specialist-performed colonoscopies). We will source cancer data from the South Carolina Central Cancer Registry (SCCCR) and death data from the SC Vital Statistics registry. We will classify incident cancers by probable cause as per the documented algorithm (Pabby et al) into 4 categories: missed cancer, new cancer, incomplete removal, failed biopsy detection, and incomplete colonoscopy.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project explores a key knowledge gap regarding the performance quality and colorectal cancer (CRC) protection effect of colonoscopies performed by primary care physicians (PCP) under a innovative program (with inbuilt quality assurance mechanisms to compensate for PCPs' lack of formal gastroenterology training) in South Carolina.

"Colorectal Cancer Education and Screening Program (CCESP)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is an essential component to the reduction of cancer health disparities. By using CBPR with community partners, we will increase colorectal cancer screening in underserved areas. In order to increase screening, we plan to provide education and screening for Arkansans in two underserved counties in the Arkansas Delta, specifically Northeast (Mississippi County) and Southeast (St. Francis County). Both education and provision of FOBT kits with reminders are proven means of increasing screening rates. A combination of the two has not been investigated to determine if screening rates can be further improved. Based on this, we hypothesize that a CBPR intervention providing education, awareness and FOBT screening tests in two underserved communities will Increase screening uptake rates above either treatment alone or control. We will test the hypothesis through the following Specific Aims:      Specific Aim 1: Implement standard, culturally tailored, and no treatment control co-developed interventions for colorectal cancer screening in collaboration with community partners to increase uptake of colorectal screening via FOBT screening techniques.   Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy of the standard and culturally tailored screening interventions (treatment arms) on uptake of colorectal cancer screening compared to the no treatment control arm and to each other   Specific Aim 3: Develop a dissemination plan of preliminary findings to distribute to community partners and research community as they become available.      Upon completion of the CBPR intervention, the collaboration of community partners and academicians will result in reduction of CRC disparities through education, increased knowledge, and screening. Our novel approach partners academia with the community in all aspects of a CBPR study evaluating a previously unexplored combination of education and provision of FOBT cards and reminders to increase colorectal cancer screening. Further, this study will allow us to better understand factors influencing cancer screening uptake. Future studies will include the full dissemination of findings of this study and further refinement of tailored screening interventions to address various cancer disparities.          ",Colorectal Cancer Education and Screening Program (CCESP),8065933,R24MD002805,"['Policies ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' uptake ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Awareness ', ' Rural ', ' Preventive ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Communities ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Ensure ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' American ', ' Adoption ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Training ', ' cost ', ' Societies ', ' Patients ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' arm ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' improved ', ' Future ', ' programs ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Participant ', ' Outcome ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Process ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' base ', ' Research ', ' Techniques ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Health ', ' Reporting ', ' Goals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Universities ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Area ', ' Data ', ' community setting ', ' Academia ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Mississippi ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' Progress Review Group ', ' Arkansas ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Community Networks ', ' cancer education ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' County ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Improve Access ', ' minority health ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R24,2011,485691,0.11527707826925021
"Community Context of Colorectal Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates are far below recommendations by the US Preventive Services Task Force. Among the nearly 100 million adults aged 50 or older in the United States, less than 50% have ever had a screening endoscopy (Shapiro et al., 2008). A further concern is that the screening rate for minority and low socioeconomic groups is even lower (Doubeni et al., 2009; Johnson-Kozlow, et al., 2009). These disparities are not explained away by individual coverage of health insurance. Instead, there is speculation that a complex combination of socioeconomic disadvantage and place of residence may contribute to these persistent disparities in screening (Christie, et al., 2009; Doubeni et al., 2009; Henry, Niu, Boscoe, 2009). An emerging area of interest in public health in general-and cancer screening in particular-is the effect that contextual forces may play in shaping use of health care services (Arcury et al., 2005; Hiscock et al., 2008; Onega et al., 2008). A better understanding of the role of other contextual barriers to screening-such as the supply of medical resources-may not only be important for understanding the barriers to colorectal cancer screening, but may also be more amenable to policy interventions (e.g., these types of barriers fit within current health care reform efforts). The research we are proposing will provide a basis for understanding the contextual factors impacting colorectal cancer screening, as well as new insights on the role of factors that contribute to disparities in CRC screening. Data from this study can be used to develop strategies to increase colorectal cancer screening and reduce disparities. Our first aim will identify community level barriers for colorectal cancer screening including demographic characteristics, medical resource supply, and insurance market. Our second aim will determine which community level barriers contribute to race/ethnic disparities in colorectal cancer screening. To address the specific aims, analysis will be performed on secondary data from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Cancer Control Module linked with the 2007 Area Resource File (ARF). NHIS is a population-based survey of individuals, and ARF is a collection of county level data. NHIS was collected under statutory authority that requires strict protection of respondent confidentiality. To maintain confidentiality, public versions of these data do not contain aggregate level identifiers. To facilitate access to contextually linked files, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) has established research data centers. NCHS will link the NHIS and ARF through the Research Data Center. Access to a contextual-link file for these data sets requires application to NCHS and investigator guarantees to maintain confidentiality.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer screening may be perceived to be unpleasant, embarrassing, frightening, and time- consuming, and this perception is a major barrier relative to other types of preventive screening and likely among the major reasons that colorectal cancer screening is far below recommended levels. Aside from improved technology that would reduce the time and unpleasantness of the procedure, public health officials are left with identifying and removing as many other barriers to screening as possible. Factors related to the structure and organization of the community not only contribute to disparities in colorectal cancer deaths, but an advantage of focusing on community level characteristics is that they might be better able to ameliorate population wide disparities in colorectal cancer compared to individual level interventions for patients and providers.        Colorectal cancer screening may be perceived to be unpleasant, embarrassing, frightening, and time- consuming, and this perception is a major barrier relative to other types of preventive screening and likely among the major reasons that colorectal cancer screening is far below recommended levels.

"Race, pathomolecular signature and colorectal cancer survival     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd most common malignancy in the US and the third leading cause of cancer death. Compared to European Americans (EAs), African Americans (AAs) have a substantially higher CRC mortality rate that is a function of both a higher incidence rate and lower survival rate. Racial disparities in survival persist even after controlling for stage at diagnosis. The reasons for this are not known, but possible explanations include racial differences in aggressiveness of the tumors, socioeconomic variables, and or treatment-related factors. The training and research plan proposed in this K07 career development award will enable me to transition to the next phase of my academic career as an independent investigator in molecular and genetic cancer epidemiology. The training plan consists of several complementary activities including: (1) didactic training (formal coursework/workshops), (2) wet-laboratory experience, (3) attendance at national conferences and seminars (4) mentored clinical research and training in the responsible conduct of research. The primary goal of the research plan is to investigate the role of race, pathologic and molecular prognostic indicators and CRC survival. The research plan is carried out in two studies. In Aim one, a clinic-based study, we will perform a cross-sectional analysis to provide a comprehensive and accurate summary of the pathologic, molecular, and pathomolecular features of primary and metastatic tumors in AAs and EAs with CRC. Specifically, we will estimate the proportion of poor pathologic (e.g. histologic type, colonic location, grade) and molecular (e.g. KRAS, BRAF, p53, CIMP, MSI) prognostic indicators in AAs compared to EAs. In Aim 2, building on Aim 1, we will perform a survival analysis in a cohort of CRC patients to examine the joint influence of race and pathologic and molecular prognostic indicators on survival. Specifically, we will test the hypotheses that after adjustment for confounding variables, (a) younger (<50 years old) AAs compared to EAs will have a higher proportion of poor pathomolecular prognostic indicators and worse survival and (b) older (e 50 years old) AAs compared to EAs will have similar proportions of poor pathomolecular prognostic indicators and similar survival. The combination of the candidate's commitment to understanding the etiology of the racial disparity in colorectal neoplasia, the excellence and expertise of her mentoring team and the strong institutional commitment of the Medical University of South Carolina (a designated National Cancer Center) to reduce the racial disparities in cancer will help the applicant become an independent researcher. The research findings from the present proposal will culminate in a submission of an R01 in year 4 of the award. Ultimately, my goal is draw on the techniques in molecular and genetic epidemiology to reduce the disparities in incidence and survival between AAs and EAs in South Carolina and beyond.               Public Health Relevancy Statement Colorectal cancer is the source of significant morbidity and mortality especially among African Americans. Studies, like the one proposed, seek to understand the etiology of the racial disparities in colorectal cancer and hence provide insights into the mechanisms of the disease process. We envision the present proposal as part of the larger question of exploring, understanding, and improving outcomes among AA diagnosed with colorectal cancer.","Race, pathomolecular signature and colorectal cancer survival",8242520,K07CA151864,"['Stage at Diagnosis ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' South Carolina ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' sex ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' career ', ' KRAS2 gene ', ' v-Ki-RAS2 Kirsten Rat Sarcoma 2 Viral Oncogene Homolog ', ' RASK2 ', ' Oncogene K-Ras ', ' Ki-RAS ', ' KRAS2 ', ' KRAS ', ' K-Ras-2 Oncogene ', ' K-Ras 2A ', ' K-RAS2B ', ' K-RAS2A ', ' C-K-RAS ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Research Training ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Source ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' tumor ', ' Cancer Center ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Characteristics ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Incidence ', ' Techniques ', ' cancer prevention ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mentors ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Clinic ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' large bowel neoplasm ', ' colorectal neoplasia ', ' Large Intestine Tumor ', ' Large Intestine Neoplasm ', ' Large Bowel Tumor ', ' Colorectal Tumors ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' BRAF gene ', ' v-raf Murine Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog B1 ', ' RAFB1 ', ' BRAF ', ' B-raf-1 ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' European ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Registries ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' neoplasia ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' treatment response ', ' Pathologic ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Testing ', ' Goals ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Population ', ' Age ', ' Reporting ', ' Data ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' response ', ' Staging ', ' Process ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Award ', ' improved ', ' cohort ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Training ', ' Patients ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' insight ', ' Molecular ', ' Address ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Universities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Phenotype ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Research ', ' Laboratories ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' base ', ' Outcome ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Age Factors ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' CpG Island Methylator Phenotype ', ' CIMP ', ' medically underserved ', ' ']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K07,2011,130415,0.08594020016947371
"Neighborhood Effects on Colorectal Cancer Incidence and Stage of Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary The proposed project is a longitudinal, observational study incorporating both area and individual level variables to assess contextual effects of the neighborhood on colorectal cancer incidence and stage of diagnosis. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second highest cause of cancer related deaths in the US. Minority populations are disproportionately affected and are known to have adverse outcomes. Although screening guidelines exist, a large proportion of cases are still being diagnosed at late stages. Since CRC has a long latency period, exposure to a deleterious social environment along with other risk factors portend poor prognosis. For this study, a conceptual model depicting the varying levels of exposure to risk factors, in multiple domains, with differing pathways in access to resources, resulting in a certain level of community health was adapted for use. In addition, secondary analysis of Cancer Registry and Census data circumvents the prohibitive costs of primary data collection, particularly for small research projects. The specific aims of this multilevel and ecological study are to examine relationships between contextual variables and the cases of CRC at block group and census tract level, early/late stage diagnosis at multiple levels simultaneously and also to examine the geographic variation in spatial and temporal trends in CRC incidence and late stage diagnosis for the years 1998-2003 in Houston, using Poisson models in SaTScan. Census derived readily available social environment variables such as occupational class, education level, poverty, overcrowding, linguistic isolation etc. will be the independent variables. CRC cases and early/late stage diagnosis will be analyzed as the dependent variables.  Addressing disparities in cancer etiology is a high priority area for National Institute of Health and National Cancer Institute and secondary analysis of existing datasets is an important requirement of the R03 mechanism and the program announcement. As the local health department in the fourth largest city in the country, we are responsible for identifying geographic areas of need and lack of access to resources and developing appropriate intervention strategies to address them. We anticipate that our results will be easily translatable to other large cities, similar to ours, with diverse populations. This study will help us better understand cancer disparities and tease out the socio-environmental factors that play a role in adverse outcomes using ecological, multilevel and geospatial analytic techniques.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative  Public Health Relevance: Our study will result in greater understanding of the distribution, etiology, spatio-temporal patterns of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Houston, the fourth largest city in the country. It will also identify areas of the city with greater than expected rates. This will help ascertain important social, environmental and behavioral risk factors that play a role in late stage diagnosis of this disease. This study will not only help inform science, but also community health professionals in designing programs to address some of the modifiable factors, in settings similar to ours. In addition, the policy implications at various levels of the government such as the City and State level and translation of research into practice by enhancing health promotion, health literacy and CRC screening in high risk areas are some of the potential benefits that will be achieved.           Project Narrative  Public Health Relevance: Our study will result in greater understanding of the distribution, etiology, spatio-temporal patterns of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Houston, the fourth largest city in the country.

"Doctor-Patient Communication about Colorectal Cancer Screening and Health Dispari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this career development application is to launch an independent research program in cancer prevention and control with specific expertise in improving clinician-patient communication in underserved populations. Recent attention has been paid to the vital role of communication in clinical encounters and its effect on patient outcomes. In general, this research has not taken place with underserved populations, although patients in underserved populations have higher levels of mistrust of their clinicians, report lower levels of satisfaction with the encounter, and have poorer adherence. Given the import of clinician-patient communication and the emerging evidence about the effectiveness of interventions to improve clinician-patient communication, a more sophisticated understanding of communication between doctors and underserved patients and its impact on patient outcomes is required. Learning objectives for this career award include: 1) gain an increased understanding of the factors influencing health disparities in order to better plan studies and interpret results; 2) obtain a working knowledge of cancer epidemiology to inform my selection of outcome measures; 3) learn core principles for developing community interventions to change health behavior; 4) develop working relationships with researchers in health disparities through conference attendance and networking; 5) explore the communication between providers and low-income, minority patients with a focus on adherence to CRC screening; and 6) use a community-based participatory approach to obtain stakeholders' opinions about feasibility and acceptability of doctor-focused communication training interventions. Colorectal cancer screening will provide the paradigm for study in this application because of the disparities in both screening and cancer incidence by race, income, and education. The in-depth study of the effect of doctor-patient discussions about cancer screening will provide the opportunity to explore unique challenges faced in clinician-patient communication in underserved populations. Ultimately, this work will lead to the development of interventions to improve communication in these settings. Through intensive interaction with mentors and multi- disciplinary colleagues within a well-resourced institutional environment, formal coursework and educational activities, and the proposed research, this award will prepare me for a career as an independent researcher in doctor-patient communication and health disparities.           Project Narrative Doctor-patient communication plays a key role in improving adherence to colorectal cancer screening.

"Effectiveness of Screening Colonoscopy in Reducing Deaths from Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers of the colon and rectum (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the US, can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques. Although some expert groups in the US consider colonoscopy to be the standard, there is currently only limited direct evidence to support its increasing use for screening in average risk adults. Colonoscopy has higher risks and costs than other screening tests. Recent studies reported that colonoscopy did not reduce mortality from right-sided colon cancers, the part of the colon that is beyond the reach of sigmoidoscopy. However, those findings were controversial because that study was unable to distinguish screening from diagnostic uses or accurately assess the completeness of colonoscopies. This project's goal is to inform clinical and policy decisions by providing evidence to show whether the purported benefits of colonoscopy are realized in practice. The primary specific aim is to estimate the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy in reducing death from CRC among average-risk adults when compared to no screening, overall and separately for right- and left-sided cancers. Our secondary aims are to: 1) determine the impact of the completeness of colonoscopy examinations on its effectiveness; and 2) compare the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy relative to sigmoidoscopy. We will use a case-control design nested in an historical cohort of persons receiving care at 3 sites participating in a research consortium, Cancer Research Network (CRN). These sites provide the full continuum of cancer care to their members ranging from screening through end of life care, and provide access to information on CRC screening that can be linked to diagnosis and cause-specific mortality data on large numbers of racially and socioeconomically diverse persons. We will identify at least 1,200 cases of CRC deaths between 2007 and 2014 among enrollees who were 52 years or older at the date of the diagnosis, each matched within each health plan to two randomly selected controls based on age, sex and enrollment history. We will identify screening history for a minimum of 10 years prior to cancer diagnosis, differentiating screening from diagnostic procedures, using standardized targeted chart reviews and other sources. The sample size will provide sufficient power for separate evaluations of tumors located in the right colon. This project will be carried out by an experienced interdisciplinary team representing epidemiology, case-control methodology, biostatistics, gastroenterology and primary care. Team members are national leaders in CRC screening research and policy. This project is in synergy with existing NCI and the CRN goals to: 1) develop methods and approaches to provide clinical, policy-relevant information; and 2) inform clinical and public health decisions on CRC screening. This application is also responsive to the NCI's priority to improve understanding of the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of tests used in screening for CRC, a ""health disparity condition"", and addresses Healthy People 2010 goals to reduce cancer death.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, but many of these cancers can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques.

"Optimizing Survivorship and Surveillance after Treatment for Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in the U.S. and is a leading cause of cancer death. African Americans (AAs) have significantly higher CRC mortality rates than European Americans (EAs). Post-treatment (defined as post-surgical) surveillance is critical to screen for cancer recurrence and promote lifestyle changes to reduce risk of recurrence. However, most survivors do not receive guideline-recommended surveillance. Little is known about factors associated with adherence to clinical surveillance guidelines (i.e., office visits, carcionoembryonic antigen (CEA) tests, colonoscopy) or adherence to lifestyle-related surveillance guidelines for weight, exercise, alcohol and tobacco use.  The purpose of this R21 study is to systematically investigate the role of multi-level factors on participation of CRC survivors in guideline-based post-treatment surveillance care. We will investigate the role of personal factors (e.g., health status, knowledge, attitudes and demographics), provider (e.g. physician-patient and specialist-primary care communication), and practice level factors (e.g., health care use, insurance) on survivor care experiences and outcomes. In Phase 1, we will conduct and analyze focus groups (FGs) of AA (n=20) and EA survivors (n=20) 1.5 years post-treatment to assess their surveillance care experiences. Two additional FGs (1 with AAs and 1 with EAs, each n=10) will be conducted with survivors who are 2-3 months post- treatment to explore their expectations about, and experiences with, follow-up care. We will also conduct and analyze data from interviews with primary care and specialist MDs (n=20) to assess practices related to surveillance and to pretest modifications to a national physician survey. We will develop a survivor survey and an MD survey to systematically examine barriers and facilitators of surveillance care. In Phase 2, we will use cognitive interviewing techniques with CRC survivors (n=16) to pretest the surveys. We will then evaluate the psychometric properties of the survivor survey (n=150 statewide survivors) and gain estimates of outcome measures to guide a subsequent R01. We will triangulate and synthesize findings to develop multi-level interventions to improve the transition from cancer treatment to follow-up by delineating specific strategies most likely to influence patient, provider and practice level enablers. We will use intervention mapping methods to develop theory-driven objectives and intervention strategies and messages.  The proposed work is of vital importance and is timely with scientific and clinical relevance. Additionally, the study will be conducted at two National Cancer Institute-funded health care sites in SC, which have diverse geographic areas, a large proportion of AA adults and relevant health disparities. The study results will lead to a future R01 trial in which the theoretically guided recommendations for targeted intervention strategies and messages developed in this study will be tested to improve adherence.        CRC survivors face high rates of recurrence, so adherence to post-treatment surveillance care is critical to reducing their morbidity and mortality. This study will investigate multi-level factors (personal, provider, organization/practice level) which are related to guideline recommended surveillance care. Findings will be used to design culturally appropriate interventions to improve adherence.

"Identification of Significant Race Associated Colon Cancer Drive Gene Mutations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the Program Announcement - Exploratory/Developmental Grants Program for Basic Research in Cancer Health Disparities. PA Number: PAR-09-160. The grant proposal is entitled: 'Identification of Significant Race Associated Colon Cancer Driver Gene Mutations'. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that patterns of driver gene [CAN gene] mutations differ among colon cancers arising in individuals of different race, reflecting at the molecular level differences in disease epidemiology, lifestyle, and environmental exposures among these groups. CRC is one of the common cancers with significant disparities attributed to racial/ethnic etiologic factors. African Americans have a significantly higher incidence of morbidity and mortality caused by CRC than the Caucasian population. Tumor CAN gene mutation profiles are directly related to cancer progression and clinical behavior in virtually all cancer systems. Our recent identification of the 140 CRC CAN genes and our ability to molecularly stratify CRC patients in terms of racial heritage - as well as using patient self-declared status - places us in a unique position to look at the influence of race on this fundamental aspect of cancer biology. Furthermore we have developed the ability to assess the influence of a patient's ancestry on individual tumor CAN gene mutations. The aim of this proposal will be to sequence the 140 CAN genes in a matched set of CRCs from African Americans and Caucasians. These patients will be initially stratified by self-declared race. Furthermore, these patients will be reclassified based on each individual's African and European Ancestry Informative Markers. These studies are enabled by a number of different efforts by our group. We have constructed a large, well-annotated, biorepository containing colon cancer tissue specimens from patients treated at a large medical center over the last 20 years. The majority of these specimens are formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues [FFPE]. Over the last few years we worked to develop sophisticated approaches to enhance the reliability of DNA extraction from FFPE materials. In tandem with these efforts we developed an infrastructure and knowledge base to support high throughput sequencing such as envisioned in this proposal. This includes the acquisition of a 'Next Generation' sequencer and hiring of faculty members to further extend the depth of expertise in this area at our institution. This proposal has the potential to significantly advance the understanding of the effects of racial/ethnic predisposition in cancers overall and in CRC - the second most common human cancer.        African Americans disproportionately suffer excess morbidity and mortality from most forms of cancer compared to the population at large. The largest differences occur in colon cancer. The results from the research proposed in this application may have broad implications for developing more individualized approaches to managing colon cancer in the African American community as well as the population as a whole.

"Strategies and Opportunities to Stop Colon Cancer in Priority Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The federal government has set a Healthy People 2020 goal of a 70.5% screening rate for colorectal cancer (CRC), but almost half of eligible U.S. adults are not up to date on their screenings. Among minority and low-income populations, the CRC screening rate is extremely low. To address this disparity, we will develop and test a culturally tailored, health care system-based program to improve CRC screening rates in OCHIN, a community-based collaborative network of more than 200 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). Racial and ethnic minorities, along with low-income and medically underserved populations, increasingly receive their primary care at FQHCs, which serve nearly 19 million patients annually throughout the United States. OCHIN is the largest national FQHC network. Its integrated electronic health record system combining medical, laboratory, and claims data will serve as a novel and robust data source for our study. In Phase I (Year 01), we will pilot-test an evidence-based approach to improving participation in CRC screening in two OCHIN FQHCs. This phase will include an assessment of the intervention's feasibility, effectiveness, and cost. In Phase II (Years 02-05), we will conduct a comparative effectiveness pragmatic clinical trial, using a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of our CRC screening program designed explicitly for FQHC clinics. Throughout the project, we will work with a diverse planning advisory group of OCHIN clinicians and patients, community representatives, state policy makers, and researchers, using principles of Community-Based Participatory Research.  Because OCHIN is the largest single FQHC network and serves patients who are diverse in race, ethnicity, and insurance status, our results will play a transformative role in accelerating CRC screening research in underserved populations. Our program will expand meaningful use of electronic health information; synergistically meet national goals to improve cancer screening rates, address health disparities, and reduce health care costs; and act as a catalyst for future systems-based approaches to improve care delivery in FQHCs and other health systems.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States.

"Reducing disparities in colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Vietnamese Americans are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites. Consistent with our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer, we propose to disseminate an evidence-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention supported by a media campaign (Media) to increase CRC screening in this poor and medically underserved population. We will use the Pathways Framework, Community-Based Participatory Research process, and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to guide our approach to the intervention, community participation, and dissemination. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a CRC LHW + Media intervention in increasing CRC screening among Vietnamese Americans aged 50 to 74 who have never had a CRC screening test, 2) identify predictors of CRC screening, and 3) evaluate the process of community participation. Following formative research using a cognitive testing approach to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials and survey instruments, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial among Vietnamese Americans aged 50-74 in Santa Clara County California, who have never had a CRC screening test prior to recruitment. We will follow two longitudinal cohorts among whom we will conduct a pre-intervention survey of participants' knowledge, intention, and behavior as regards CRC screening; implement CRC screening educational sessions in an experimental group and nutrition educational sessions in a comparison group; and conduct a post-intervention survey. Each of the two cohorts will include 150 men and 150 women to have a total sample size of 600. The media intervention component will distribute Vietnamese-language health education materials through print and electronic media. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the frequency of screening using pre- and post-intervention surveys. To test our primary hypothesis regarding the effects of the intervention on screening activity, we will use Z-tests. We will also employ logistic regression models to test the effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for CRC screening. In addition, we will conduct process evaluation of the intervention and community participation. If this intervention is found to be effective, this LHW model could be applied in health promotion programs to further reduce disparities in CRC screening in Vietnamese Americans and evaluated in other behavioral objectives and settings to reduce health disparities in other poor and underserved populations.

"Colon cancer disparity elimination: a faith-based participatory partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elimination of the glaring colorectal cancer-related disparities in African Americans (AA) IS POSSIBLE. In this community based participatory research project (CPBR), we address both the SUPPLY and DEMAND components of the solution. Employing the community consultants and physicians successfully trained in Phase I, we have an adequate provider base to satisfy the increased demand resulting from this faith oriented barrier-free colonoscopy screening initiative. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is predominately preventable through screening for and removal of precancerous polyps. Unfortunately every year over 50,000 Americans of all races die unnecessarily. Multiple barriers result in an unacceptable disparity in both incidence and mortality for the AA, with the result that the death rate for AA males with advanced CRC cancer is double that for white males. The discovery of the evolution of CRC from benign polyps gives physicians ample time to remove the offending tissue prior to the development of cancers. The importance for screening in the AA population is accentuated by the documented shorter interval from the appearance of a polyp until its malignant transformation. We also know that colonoscopy is the ""gold standard."" The current capacity for performing colonoscopy is far below what is needed to screen the at-risk population as recent data reveals that only one-third of the appropriate population is compliant. In addition to capacity issues, many barriers to screening are patient related characteristics such as knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, cultural and ethnic issues, acceptability of screening method(s), ability to pay, and other socioeconomic and environmental issues (i.e. transportation, stigma, social support, etc.). Although over 80% of colonoscopies are provided by gastroenterologists, less than 4% in training are AA, fostering a growing gap in culturally competent colonoscopy providers. Using a triangulated theoretical framework including the Health Belief Model, the Social Cognitive Theory and the RE-AIM Evaluation model, we will further demonstrate a successful solution to addressing both SUPPLY (capacity for colorectal screening) and DEMAND (targeted patient access to and utilization of colorectal screening). The Phase I study confirmed that compliance can be achieved comparable to that for breast cancer screening (75%). The astounding high-rate of neoplasia (4%) emphasizes the critical importance of this endeavor.

"Community Context of Colorectal Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates are far below recommendations by the US Preventive Services Task Force. Among the nearly 100 million adults aged 50 or older in the United States, less than 50% have ever had a screening endoscopy (Shapiro et al., 2008). A further concern is that the screening rate for minority and low socioeconomic groups is even lower (Doubeni et al., 2009; Johnson-Kozlow, et al., 2009). These disparities are not explained away by individual coverage of health insurance. Instead, there is speculation that a complex combination of socioeconomic disadvantage and place of residence may contribute to these persistent disparities in screening (Christie, et al., 2009; Doubeni et al., 2009; Henry, Niu, Boscoe, 2009). An emerging area of interest in public health in general-and cancer screening in particular-is the effect that contextual forces may play in shaping use of health care services (Arcury et al., 2005; Hiscock et al., 2008; Onega et al., 2008). A better understanding of the role of other contextual barriers to screening-such as the supply of medical resources-may not only be important for understanding the barriers to colorectal cancer screening, but may also be more amenable to policy interventions (e.g., these types of barriers fit within current health care reform efforts). The research we are proposing will provide a basis for understanding the contextual factors impacting colorectal cancer screening, as well as new insights on the role of factors that contribute to disparities in CRC screening. Data from this study can be used to develop strategies to increase colorectal cancer screening and reduce disparities. Our first aim will identify community level barriers for colorectal cancer screening including demographic characteristics, medical resource supply, and insurance market. Our second aim will determine which community level barriers contribute to race/ethnic disparities in colorectal cancer screening. To address the specific aims, analysis will be performed on secondary data from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Cancer Control Module linked with the 2007 Area Resource File (ARF). NHIS is a population-based survey of individuals, and ARF is a collection of county level data. NHIS was collected under statutory authority that requires strict protection of respondent confidentiality. To maintain confidentiality, public versions of these data do not contain aggregate level identifiers. To facilitate access to contextually linked files, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) has established research data centers. NCHS will link the NHIS and ARF through the Research Data Center. Access to a contextual-link file for these data sets requires application to NCHS and investigator guarantees to maintain confidentiality.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer screening may be perceived to be unpleasant, embarrassing, frightening, and time- consuming, and this perception is a major barrier relative to other types of preventive screening and likely among the major reasons that colorectal cancer screening is far below recommended levels. Aside from improved technology that would reduce the time and unpleasantness of the procedure, public health officials are left with identifying and removing as many other barriers to screening as possible. Factors related to the structure and organization of the community not only contribute to disparities in colorectal cancer deaths, but an advantage of focusing on community level characteristics is that they might be better able to ameliorate population wide disparities in colorectal cancer compared to individual level interventions for patients and providers.

"CBPR Strategies to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Ohio Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): a disproportionate burden of CRC incidence and mortality, mainly due to lower utilization of recommended CRC screening tests. The Appalachian region of Ohio suffers from this burden of disease in addition to higher poverty, lower employment, and lower educational levels. To address this cancer health disparity, our health disparities research team at The Ohio State University (OSU) in partnership with four Appalachia-based community coalitions have used community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods to design and pilot test two interventions intended to increase CRC screening rates in one Appalachian county (Phase 1).  The goal of this application is to test these CRC screening interventions in 12 Ohio Appalachian counties (Phase 2) in preparation for a full-scale dissemination trial (Phase 3) in 6 additional Appalachian states within the Appalachia Community Cancer Network (ACCN).      The specific aims of this Phase 2 proposal are to: 1) utilize CBPR methods to refine specific county-level media campaigns and clinic-based messages about CRC screening (entitled ""Get Behind Your Health!"") or an attention control message (a healthy eating campaign entitled ""PEACHES"") in 12 Ohio Appalachia counties; 2) implement and test, using a group-randomized design, a staggered county-wide intervention program that compares county-specific media campaigns featuring local CRC survivors, clinic-specific charter reminder systems, and a combination of the two strategies in 6 randomly selected intervention counties to the same campaign strategies in 6 randomly selected attention control counties using county specific healthy eating campaigns featuring local farmers and educational material placed in clinics; 3) utilize process (convenience samples of county residents) and outcome evaluation (4 independent cross-sectional surveys of residents of each county) strategies to assess the efficacy of each strategy on improving CRC screening rates; and 4) utilize the results, to plan the dissemination of the intervention into 36 Appalachian counties in 6 additional states of the ACCN in a subsequent Phase 3 study.      All specific aims will be carried out using CBPR principles, in full partnership with these four Ohio Appalachian community-based cancer coalitions, and will be guided by an underlying theoretical framework of the Transtheoretical Model, in conjunction with three behavioral theories relevant to behavior change (Social Cognitive Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action, and Attitude Accessibility Theory).  The results of this study, thus, will have immediate impact in these Appalachian counties, as the community will be able to institutionalize successful strategies into existing county-wide health campaigns.

African Americans have the highest CRC incidence and mortality of all US populations. These disparities have not been explained, and biological risk factors including genetic susceptibility to CRC are understudied in African Americans. I am a gastroenterologist who seeks to develop a career as an independent translational physician-scientist in CRC genetics. My long-term career goals require me to obtain additional training in: 1) molecular and statistical genetics; and 2) cancer biology. The 5-year career development program described in this application will take place at the University of Chicago which distinguishes itself in the field of human and cancer genetics especially in admixed populations. I am fortunate to have key collaborators at the University of North Carolina and the University of Illinois Chicago, and together we have DNA from over 1000 African American CRC patients and 1000 African American control subjects available for my proposed study. Dr. Nancy Cox, Professor of Medicine and Chief of Human Genetics, is my mentor and will provide expertise in statistical genetics. Dr. Nathan Ellis, Associate Professor of Medicine, is a co-mentor and will provide expertise in CRC molecular genetics. An inter-disciplinary Advisory Committee comprised of Dr. Rick Kittles, an expert in genetics of admixed populations, Dr. Olufunmilayo Olopade, an internationally recognized leader in cancer genetics, and Dr. Eugene Chang, a successful physician-scientist in gastroenterology, will guide and advise me during this development period. The broad objectives of this research proposal are the identification of genetic susceptibility factors that contribute to risk of CRC development in African Americans. I will study single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered using genome-wide association studies in European populations. Regions containing these SNP are likely to harbor functional variants. African Americans are an ideal population in whom to identify functional variants because their genomes exhibit less linkage disequilibrium. To this end, I propose three specific aims: 1) Validate candidate CRC-associated regions in African American cases and controls; 2) Discover novel SNPs in CRC-associated regions by targeted resequencing using next-generation sequencing technologies; and 3) Identify putative functional variants in candidate CRC-associated regions that can be further evaluated in future functional studies. By the end of my career development period, I will be uniquely equipped to undertake further translational research in CRC genetics. My long-term research goals are to understand genetic susceptibility in CRC pathogenesis and to study how genetic susceptibility factors can be used to risk stratify individuals for CRC screening and thereby prevent disease especially in high risk but understudied populations like African Americans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of all US populations, African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer. Reasons for these differences are not explained, and hereditary factors have not been extensively studied in this high risk population. The goal of our study is to better understand hereditary factors that increase risk of colorectal cancer especially in African-Americans.

"Effectiveness of Screening Colonoscopy in Reducing Deaths from Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers of the colon and rectum (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the US, can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques. Although some expert groups in the US consider colonoscopy to be the standard, there is currently only limited direct evidence to support its increasing use for screening in average risk adults. Colonoscopy has higher risks and costs than other screening tests. Recent studies reported that colonoscopy did not reduce mortality from right-sided colon cancers, the part of the colon that is beyond the reach of sigmoidoscopy. However, those findings were controversial because that study was unable to distinguish screening from diagnostic uses or accurately assess the completeness of colonoscopies. This project's goal is to inform clinical and policy decisions by providing evidence to show whether the purported benefits of colonoscopy are realized in practice. The primary specific aim is to estimate the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy in reducing death from CRC among average-risk adults when compared to no screening, overall and separately for right- and left-sided cancers. Our secondary aims are to: 1) determine the impact of the completeness of colonoscopy examinations on its effectiveness; and 2) compare the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy relative to sigmoidoscopy. We will use a case-control design nested in an historical cohort of persons receiving care at 3 sites participating in a research consortium, Cancer Research Network (CRN). These sites provide the full continuum of cancer care to their members ranging from screening through end of life care, and provide access to information on CRC screening that can be linked to diagnosis and cause-specific mortality data on large numbers of racially and socioeconomically diverse persons. We will identify at least 1,200 cases of CRC deaths between 2007 and 2014 among enrollees who were 52 years or older at the date of the diagnosis, each matched within each health plan to two randomly selected controls based on age, sex and enrollment history. We will identify screening history for a minimum of 10 years prior to cancer diagnosis, differentiating screening from diagnostic procedures, using standardized targeted chart reviews and other sources. The sample size will provide sufficient power for separate evaluations of tumors located in the right colon. This project will be carried out by an experienced interdisciplinary team representing epidemiology, case-control methodology, biostatistics, gastroenterology and primary care. Team members are national leaders in CRC screening research and policy. This project is in synergy with existing NCI and the CRN goals to: 1) develop methods and approaches to provide clinical, policy-relevant information; and 2) inform clinical and public health decisions on CRC screening. This application is also responsive to the NCI's priority to improve understanding of the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of tests used in screening for CRC, a ""health disparity condition"", and addresses Healthy People 2010 goals to reduce cancer death.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, but many of these cancers can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques. Although many people believe that colonoscopy is the best screening test, there is currently no scientific evidence to support that claim. The goal of our proposed study is to provide scientific evidence on whether current beliefs about the benefits of colonoscopy screening are realized in actual clinical practice in order to help patients, doctors, and policy makers make decisions about colon cancer screening.

"USING PHOTOVOICE TO ENGAGE COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN PROMOTING COLORECTAL CANCER AWARE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, but it can be prevented or detected early through screening. Many racial/ethnic minority groups and those who are low income or uninsured have lower rates of screening, later stage of diagnosis, and poorer survival. Given the low public awareness about CRC and screening, one way to begin addressing CRC disparities is through community engagement. We have established a colorectal cancer partnership to begin addressing the disparities in our community. This Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) project emerged out of discussions with the Partnership. Community members were involved in the conceptualization of the ideas and are involved in several phases of the research implementation, analysis, and dissemination. In this study, we propose to implement a Photovoice project to help understand community needs and awareness of CRC and use those findings to develop CRC awareness intervention messages. Participants in the Photovoice project will be trained to use cameras to photograph their depictions of the meaning of CRC or CRC screening in their lives. Participants develop an individual narrative describing their selected photographs and group discussions will ensue where participants can discuss the meaning and context of the images. We will separate Photovoice groups into persons who have been screened and persons who have been diagnosed with CRC so that we can gather messages about prevention as well as early detection. Screener and survivor Photovoice groups will be held in two different medically underserved neighborhoods (north city and south city) in Saint Louis. Using this rubric, a total of four Photovoice groups will be held with 12 participants each. After the Photovoice project and at the discretion of the Photovoice participants, we will use a participatory process to select some of the Photovoice products for use as potential intervention messages. Such messages will then undergo formative testing using focus groups with people who have and have not been screened. Focus groups will be held in the same neighborhood locations as were the Photovoice sessions. The Specific Aims of this study are: (1) Engage community members in participatory research to identify relevant messages and images about colorectal cancer prevention and early detection using a Photovoice approach; and (2) Use the images and narratives from the Photovoice project as the basis for intervention messages that will be pre- tested using focus groups. Our expected long-term outcomes will be a stronger community partnership, community members empowered to advocate for their health, and a set of community-driven scientifically- evaluated CRC-intervention messages. In addressing colorectal cancer disparities, this study involves a significant public health issue and will lay the foundation for future CBPR work in the Saint Louis community.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Participants will be provided with cameras and asked to take photographs that reflect the meaning or impact of the health issue (colorectal cancer, screening) in their lives and then will meet with others to discuss the meaning and messages that they feel the photographs portray. Photographs with accompanying narrative messages will be evaluated for likability, interpretation, credibility, and salience of messages by focus groups to prepare messages for use in future intervention trials.

"Training African American Peers as Patient Navigators for Colon Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer health disparities related to race and ethnicity are among the most serious problems facing the US health care system. A recent Institute of Medicine report stated that such disparities are seen at every level of health care, from prevention to treatment and follow-up. This problem is acutely evident in the figures for colorectal cancer (CRC) among African Americans (AAs). According to the American Cancer Society, AAs have the highest CRC incidence and mortality of any ethnic/racial group. Indeed, CRC incidence and mortality are 15% and 43% higher among AAs than Whites, respectively. These disparities could be effectively reduced through greater AA participation in CRC screening and early detection. More importantly, due to the preponderance of CRC in AAs beyond the reach of the flexible sigmoidoscopy, increased adherence to colonoscopy among AAs will save lives. Although there is clear evidence that providing patients with someone to help them manage/navigate the health care system (i.e., patient navigation (PN)) is effective in helping them to complete cancer screening, very few hospitals provide PN for colonoscopy. The vast majority of hospitals in NYC are unable to provide PN for patients for whom colonoscopy is recommended, in large part because of the costs associated with professional-led PN. The proposed R-25E seeks to address this serious public health problem by investigating the success of training AAs who have undergone colonoscopy to serve as peer patient navigators to help others from their community complete CRC screening via colonoscopy.       The proposed training plan is supported by seven distinct lines of evidence: 1) research indicating a 76-90% reduction in CRC mortality through colonoscopy, 2) the success of PN in increasing participation in health promotion, 3) data from the NYC Department of Health showing underuse of PN for colonoscopy, 4) research demonstrating increased credibility of peers in providing health information, 5) research on volunteer-led health education interventions, 6) the cost savings we found in our preliminary research on peer led PN (PPN) for colonoscopy, and 7) our success in promoting cancer screening and preventative health care practices in AA communities of New York City through our collaboration with community leaders and church groups.       The overall goal of the proposed R-25E is to reduce CRC morbidity and mortality by increasing AA participation in colonoscopy in a cost effective way. This will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) The development and implementation of a training program for Peer Patient Navigation (PPN) to increase participation of AAs in colonoscopy; 2) The examination of the cost effectiveness of the PPN training program in completion of colonoscopy from the perspective of AAs for whom colonoscopy is recommended; and 3) The investigation of the relative cost effectiveness of the PPN training program from the perspective of hospitals.

"Modeling Effective Health Policies for Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is still the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States, despite the availability of a range of interventions to reduce the burden of CRC. Microsimulation modeling can inform policy makers in prioritizing among these cancer-control interventions. The CISNET-CRC team includes three collaborative modeling groups, each with a state-of-the-art, population-based microsimulation model for CRC: MISCAN, SimCRC, and CRC-SPIN. These three modeling groups have collaborated for eight years and have delivered a substantial body of policy-oriented work. We propose to continue this collaboration, further developing our models and using them to identify optimal cancer-control policies and practices to reduce the burden of CRC.      Our proposed work centers around three specific aims. In Aim 1 we extend our models to reflect the evolving understanding of the CRC disease processes and to incorporate new and updated screening modalities, allowing us to address new policy questions. Here we focus on new data on genomics, biomarkers, pathways, and the upcoming data from randomized controlled trials of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening. In Aim 2 we apply our updated models to inform health policy, including evaluation of interventions across the cancer-control spectrum. New technologies and more individually tailored screening and treatment strategies will be evaluated with a special focus on health disparities. In Aim 3 we disseminate results from our models to inform health policy, via methods that engage policy makers and encourage appropriate use of modeling in policy making and decision support. Here we envision innovation using open-access web-based model applications. We will begin with model extensions required for specific applications, with the balance of the work shifting heavily toward applications over the course of the funding period. Dissemination of our findings will occur throughout the funding period.

"Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening Rates in Community Health Centers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community health centers (CHCs) do not have the office systems in place to ensure that every eligible patient is offered colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. CHCs need evidence-based approaches to implementing office- system changes that take into account the substantial resource, staffing, and time constraints they face. Until this need is met, screening rates will likely remain low, putting thousands of minority, low-income, and uninsured patients at unnecessary risk. The long-term goal is to improve CRC screening rates in CHCs and in doing so, reduce cancer health disparities. The objective of this R21 application is to test the feasibility of an evidence-informed implementation strategy that combines an office-systems toolkit and outreach education. The rationale for the project, supported by preliminary data, is that CHCs want to increase CRC screening rates, but need evidence-based tools that-with training and technical assistance-they can implement and maintain more efficiently and effectively. Although the proposed implementation strategy is evidence-informed and promising, it is novel in the CHC setting and needs to be feasibility-tested in this challenging organizational context prior to larger-scale evaluation. This research study will pursue three specific aims: (1) assess the extent of implementation of office-system changes that promote CRC screening, using the CRC toolkit and outreach specialist; (2) estimate the costs of implementing and maintaining office-system changes, using the CRC toolkit and outreach specialist; (3) conduct a limited test of the office-system changes implemented, using the CRC toolkit and outreach specialist. For the first aim, interviews and surveys informed by a conceptual model of innovation implementation will be used to examine the number and type of office-system tools that CHCs implement, the amount and type of outreach support provided, and organizational factors predictive of implementation effectiveness. For the second aim, process maps, activity logs, and unit prices will be used to estimate the cost of implementing changes to the CRC screening process and calculate net benefit by comparing the costs and revenues of CRC screening processes pre- and post-implementation. For the third aim, changes in documented physician recommendation for screening and completed screenings will be assessed through chart audits pre- and post-implementation. This project is innovative in that it attempts to shift the current paradigm for making systems-based changes in CHCs from the quality improvement collaborative approach to one that promises greater feasibility given CHCs' resource constraints. The proposed research is significant because of its potential to improve public health by increasing CRC screening rates in minority, low income and insured populations and its contribution to scientific knowledge about how the office- systems approach works.        The proposed project is relevant to public health because an effective strategy for implementing office-system changes that uses fewer resources and achieves higher screening rates than current systems-based approaches could lead to the prevention or early detection of thousands of colorectal cancer cases annually among minority, low-income, and uninsured patients. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NCI's mission to conduct and fund research that improves early detection and diagnosis and reduces cancer disparities.

"Tailored Interactive Multimedia to Reduce Colorectal CA Screening Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interactive multimedia computer programs (IMCPs) show promise as a way of delivering personally tailored (PT) information to enhance cognitive mediators of health behavior and improve patient outcomes. However, it is unclear whether PT IMCPs can be deployed in primary care offices to increase cancer screening uptake and eliminate ethnic disparities in uptake by providing PT information in each user's preferred language. Aims/Hypotheses: We will compare changes in CRC screening cognitive mediators (self- efficacy, perceived barriers, and readiness) and uptake resulting from an IMCP  PT to enhance the key cognitive mediators and targeted to patients' self-identified ethnicity - with changes resulting from a non- tailored ""electronic leaflet"" control IMCP. The experimental and control IMCPs will each be offered in English and Spanish versions. We hypothesize that, compared with the appropriate control condition (English, Spanish, or both combined): (1) the English version of the PT IMCP will enhance the cognitive mediators of CRC screening behavior for English-speaking Hispanics and non-Hispanics; (2) there will be similarly favorable changes in these mediators for Hispanics using the Spanish version of the PT IMCP; (3) deployment of the PT IMCP will provide evidence of elimination of disparities in CRC screening between Hispanic and non-Hispanic subjects via its relative impact on the cognitive mediators in these groups; and (4) the PT IMCP (English and Spanish combined) will increase CRC screening uptake in Hispanics and non-Hispanics (considered separately) via changes in the cognitive mediators. Methods: Randomized controlled trial of 2 groups, comparing a PT (to the cognitive mediators) CRC screening IMCP offered in both English and Spanish versions and deployed before a primary care office visit with a non-tailored ""electronic leaflet"" CRC screening IMCP (control) also offered in both English and Spanish. Screening methods targeted will be fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. Primary outcomes will be CRC screening uptake, self- efficacy, perceived barriers, and readiness. Implications: Our findings will determine whether an IMCP that is PT to cognitive mediators of screening behavior and deployed in primary care offices prior to previously scheduled visits can activate patients of various ethnicities to undergo CRC screening. They may also suggest a promising, portable method of reducing disparities in CRC (and other) screening uptake between Hispanic and non-Hispanic individuals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our findings will determine whether an interactive multimedia computer program that is personally-tailored to cognitive mediators of screening behavior and deployed in primary care offices prior to previously scheduled visits can activate patients of various ethnicities to undergo colorectal cancer screening.

"Efficacy-to-Effectiveness Transition of an Educational Program to Increase Colore     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality and are less likely than whites to have screening for colorectal cancer (CRC). We recently completed a five-year randomized controlled community intervention trial that demonstrated the efficacy of a small group education intervention (now named EPICS or Educational Program to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening) that doubled the CRC screening rate compared to the control group rate. EPICS was then put into practice in partnership with the local health department and was equally effective. We are now disseminating the intervention across the state of Georgia. In this application we propose a national dissemination and implementation study. We propose using Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation Theory and Glasgow's RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) evaluation framework to pursue the following specific aims: 1) test passive and active approaches to disseminating EPICS to increase screening rates for colorectal cancer among African Americans; 2) measure the extent to which EPICS is accepted by community coalitions and the fidelity of implementation in various settings and 3) estimate the potential translatability and public health impact of EPICS. Diffusion of Innovations Theory will guide the process of EPICS dissemination and RE-AIM will be used to assess this dissemination and its impact. For this study we propose a cluster randomized controlled trial of 20 community coalitions from across the United States, assigned to one of four conditions: (1, passive) web-based access to facilitator training materials and toolkits without technical assistance (TA); (2, passive) the sam as 1, but with TA; (3, active) in-person access (IP) to facilitator training materials and toolkits without TA and (4, active) IP access to facilitator training materials and toolkits with TA. Each community coalition will partner with three settings for implementation: a church, clinic and community site. African Americans, 50-74 years of age, who are not current on CRC screening are eligible for study participation (n=7,200 or n=360 eligible individuals per community coalition). This assumes a sample size of 1800 per study arm, a significance level of 5% (i.e. alpha = 0.05), and a two-sided two-group chi-square test of proportions. Assuming that we observe in our study an increase in screening rates of colorectal cancer among participants in active arms compared to screening rates among participants in the passive arms, we will have greater than 99% power to detect statistically significant differences in the proportions. All statistical tests proposed for this study will be two-sided and will be performed using a significance level of 5% (i.e., alpha=0.05).        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the most important causes of cancer deaths (second to lung cancer), with persistent disparities documented by race/ethnicity. This project seeks to demonstrate the effectiveness of an intervention proven efficacious among African Americans, and to document its utility by describing its transition from research to real world settings. Successfully implementing the core elements of the intervention will increase CRC screening among African Americans and will help reduce CRC incidence and mortality.               Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the most important causes of cancer deaths (second to lung cancer), with persistent disparities documented by race/ethnicity.

"Colorectal Cancer Education and Screening Program (CCESP)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is an essential component to the reduction of cancer health disparities. By using CBPR with community partners, we will increase colorectal cancer screening in underserved areas. In order to increase screening, we plan to provide education and screening for Arkansans in two underserved counties in the Arkansas Delta, specifically Northeast (Mississippi County) and Southeast (St. Francis County). Both education and provision of FOBT kits with reminders are proven means of increasing screening rates. A combination of the two has not been investigated to determine if screening rates can be further improved. Based on this, we hypothesize that a CBPR intervention providing education, awareness and FOBT screening tests in two underserved communities will Increase screening uptake rates above either treatment alone or control. We will test the hypothesis through the following Specific Aims:      Specific Aim 1: Implement standard, culturally tailored, and no treatment control co-developed interventions for colorectal cancer screening in collaboration with community partners to increase uptake of colorectal screening via FOBT screening techniques.   Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy of the standard and culturally tailored screening interventions (treatment arms) on uptake of colorectal cancer screening compared to the no treatment control arm and to each other   Specific Aim 3: Develop a dissemination plan of preliminary findings to distribute to community partners and research community as they become available.      Upon completion of the CBPR intervention, the collaboration of community partners and academicians will result in reduction of CRC disparities through education, increased knowledge, and screening. Our novel approach partners academia with the community in all aspects of a CBPR study evaluating a previously unexplored combination of education and provision of FOBT cards and reminders to increase colorectal cancer screening. Further, this study will allow us to better understand factors influencing cancer screening uptake. Future studies will include the full dissemination of findings of this study and further refinement of tailored screening interventions to address various cancer disparities.

"Effectiveness of Screening Colonoscopy in Reducing Deaths from Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers of the colon and rectum (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the US, can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques. Although some expert groups in the US consider colonoscopy to be the standard, there is currently only limited direct evidence to support its increasing use for screening in average risk adults. Colonoscopy has higher risks and costs than other screening tests. Recent studies reported that colonoscopy did not reduce mortality from right-sided colon cancers, the part of the colon that is beyond the reach of sigmoidoscopy. However, those findings were controversial because that study was unable to distinguish screening from diagnostic uses or accurately assess the completeness of colonoscopies. This project's goal is to inform clinical and policy decisions by providing evidence to show whether the purported benefits of colonoscopy are realized in practice. The primary specific aim is to estimate the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy in reducing death from CRC among average-risk adults when compared to no screening, overall and separately for right- and left-sided cancers. Our secondary aims are to: 1) determine the impact of the completeness of colonoscopy examinations on its effectiveness; and 2) compare the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy relative to sigmoidoscopy. We will use a case-control design nested in an historical cohort of persons receiving care at 3 sites participating in a research consortium, Cancer Research Network (CRN). These sites provide the full continuum of cancer care to their members ranging from screening through end of life care, and provide access to information on CRC screening that can be linked to diagnosis and cause-specific mortality data on large numbers of racially and socioeconomically diverse persons. We will identify at least 1,200 cases of CRC deaths between 2007 and 2014 among enrollees who were 52 years or older at the date of the diagnosis, each matched within each health plan to two randomly selected controls based on age, sex and enrollment history. We will identify screening history for a minimum of 10 years prior to cancer diagnosis, differentiating screening from diagnostic procedures, using standardized targeted chart reviews and other sources. The sample size will provide sufficient power for separate evaluations of tumors located in the right colon. This project will be carried out by an experienced interdisciplinary team representing epidemiology, case-control methodology, biostatistics, gastroenterology and primary care. Team members are national leaders in CRC screening research and policy. This project is in synergy with existing NCI and the CRN goals to: 1) develop methods and approaches to provide clinical, policy-relevant information; and 2) inform clinical and public health decisions on CRC screening. This application is also responsive to the NCI's priority to improve understanding of the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of tests used in screening for CRC, a ""health disparity condition"", and addresses Healthy People 2010 goals to reduce cancer death.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, but many of these cancers can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques.

"Modeling Effective Health Policies for Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is still the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States, despite the availability of a range of interventions to reduce the burden of CRC. Microsimulation modeling can inform policy makers in prioritizing among these cancer-control interventions. The CISNET-CRC team includes three collaborative modeling groups, each with a state-of-the-art, population-based microsimulation model for CRC: MISCAN, SimCRC, and CRC-SPIN. These three modeling groups have collaborated for eight years and have delivered a substantial body of policy-oriented work. We propose to continue this collaboration, further developing our models and using them to identify optimal cancer-control policies and practices to reduce the burden of CRC.      Our proposed work centers around three specific aims. In Aim 1 we extend our models to reflect the evolving understanding of the CRC disease processes and to incorporate new and updated screening modalities, allowing us to address new policy questions. Here we focus on new data on genomics, biomarkers, pathways, and the upcoming data from randomized controlled trials of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening. In Aim 2 we apply our updated models to inform health policy, including evaluation of interventions across the cancer-control spectrum. New technologies and more individually tailored screening and treatment strategies will be evaluated with a special focus on health disparities. In Aim 3 we disseminate results from our models to inform health policy, via methods that engage policy makers and encourage appropriate use of modeling in policy making and decision support. Here we envision innovation using open-access web-based model applications. We will begin with model extensions required for specific applications, with the balance of the work shifting heavily toward applications over the course of the funding period.

"Race, prognostic markers and survival in early and late-onset colorectal cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd most common malignancy in the US and the third leading cause of cancer death. Compared to European Americans (EA), African Americans (AA) have a substantially higher CRC mortality rate that is a function of both a higher incidence rate and lower survival rate. At least some of the excess mortality in African Americans is caused by the reduced survival associated with a higher prevalence of late stage disease and more metastatic disease at diagnosis compared to EA. However, racial disparities in survival persist even after controlling for stage at diagnosis. The reasons for this are not known, but possible explanations include racial differences in biologic factors, such as the aggressiveness of the primary and/or metastatic tumors, and non-biologic factors such as socioeconomic variables, and or treatment related factors. The primary goal of the research plan is to investigate the combination of age and pathologic and pathomorphologic markers as contributing factors to the racial disparity in CRC survival. Our central hypothesis is that the racial disparity is at least partially driven by younger AA having a greater predispositio to develop more aggressive CRC, which in turn result in poorer response to treatment and hence lower overall survival. We will perform a cross sectional study to collect tumor specimens to provide a comprehensive and accurate summary of the pathologic, pathomorphologic features of primary tumors in AA and EA with CRC. Next, we will perform an analysis to examine the joint influence of race and pathologic and pathomorphologic markers on survival in early and late onset CRC in AA and EA. This study will generate needed evidence to begin to address several important questions regarding the role of pathologic indicators in influencing the differences in survival between AA and EA. The results from the present proposal will serve as preliminary data for a larger-scale study that will enroll patients throughout South Carolina. The larger study to follow will address a suite of questions that will include how biologic and non-biologic indicators impact racial differences in treatment adherence, response to therapy, and overall survival.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer is the source of significant morbidity and mortality especially among African Americans. Studies, like the one proposed, seek to understand the reasons for racial disparities in colorectal cancer and hence provide insights into the mechanisms of the disease process.

"Understanding Mechanisms of Ethnic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a rich literature documenting racial and ethnic disparities in the trajectory of cancer care and outcomes. Through analyses of tumor registry and Medicare data, the Principal Investigator and co-investigators have begun to uncover explanatory mechanisms or pathways underlying such disparities. We and others have identified disparities in survival after a diagnosis of cancer, much of which can be explained by delays in diagnosis leading to more advanced stage at diagnosis, and also by less than adequate treatment. There has also been considerable research on patient-level, physician level, and system- level factors that contribute to disparities in the trajectory of care. In this application we will conduct explanatory analyses with Medicare claims data to identify the mechanisms underlying racial disparities in stage of diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC), with a focus on the role of CRC screening among older adults. We will also develop methods to measure the performance of individual primary care physicians in providing CRC screening for patients. Of particular interest is how individual physicians' performance contributes to racial disparities in screening use. Aim 1: Determine the rate of screening for colorectal cancer in black and white men and women 65- 75 enrolled in fee for service Medicare in Michigan, New Jersey and Texas from 2001 through 2007. Aim 2: Determine the effect of other subject level (predisposing, enabling, and need) and environment level characteristics of CRC screening and determine the effect of continuity of care with a primary care physician (PCP) on receipt of CRC screening. Aim 3: Describe the variation among PCPs in use of CRC screening and determine how much of the race disparity in CRC screening is explained by PCP as opposed to patient characteristics. Aim 4: Examine the effects of provider characteristics (years in practice, age, volume of cases, primary specialty board certification, affiliation with academic medical centers, etc.) and medical system characteristics (PCPs per capita, gastroenterologists per capita) on the likelihood of CRC screening and also stratified by subjects' race. There are a number of options available to Medicare to promote health and reduce health disparities among its beneficiaries. The results of the mechanistic analyses in this application will allow for the design of interventions targeting the specific points in the trajectory of care that contribute to ethnic disparities in CRC screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the U.S., colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most frequently diagnosed but second leading cause of death among cancers. We will study Medicare data to understand better the reasons for racial disparities in CRC screening rates. With this information, Medicare will be able to design and implement interventions to promote health and reduce health disparities among its beneficiaries.

"Tailored Touchscreen Colorectal Cancer Prevention in American Indian Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality disproportionately impacts minorities.  Few studies have addressed screening among specific minority populations such as American Indians (AI).  This study will assess the efficacy of a novel tailored touch screen computer intervention based on an innovative integration of the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) and the concept of ""implementation intentions,"" a recent elaboration of the Theory of Planned Behavior.  The majority of the intervention will be delivered in tribal clinics and primary care settings on low-cost touch screen computers through multimedia audio-narrative and video messages.  Studies have not tested the effectiveness of culturally tailored communications specified to stated ""implementation intentions"" for improving CRC screening in this group.  A randomized design will test a comparison condition of generic information versus a  multimedia tailored intervention that specifically addresses each participant's screening test modality  preference, current CRC screening decisional stage (PAPM), and CRC screening ""implementation  intentions"" (the ""when"", ""where"" and ""how"" details of screening).  Behavioral intervention materials will be developed with the help of cultural experts, a pilot test, and from data gathered in a prior focus group study we used to assess key influences on CRC screening for AIs.  The study will be conducted with 460 AI patients eligible for CRC screening and recruited while presenting for care in tribal or regional safety-net clinics.  All participants will receive a baseline touch screen administered assessment and, depending on stated preference, be offered either an immunochemical fecal occult blood test (iFOBT-InSure TM) or colonoscopy.  Participants will be randomized to either C (comparison group-computer  delivered generic CRC information) or AI2 (active intervention-computer delivered culturally tailored  messaging based on individual PAPM stage, behavior constructs, and ""Implementation Intentions"").  A brief office exit survey will assess patient-provider discussions of CRC screening and satisfaction with computerized message materials.           Colorectal Cancer is a major cause of cancer mortality and late stage presentation is common among minorities. American Indians, receive colorectal cancer screening at very low rates and face important cultural barriers to care in the health care system. This study is relevant to overarching approaches to reduce AI cancer health disparities because it tests a novel behavioral intervention and culturally tailored materials to improve rates of colorectal cancer screening in this underserved population group.

"Development of Tailored Intervention to Promote CRC Screening Among Latino Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to the Program Announcement ""Health Promotion among Racial and Ethnic Minority Males"" (PA-07-421).  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality among Latinos despite effective screening methods. While rates of screening overall have increased, the disparities in CRC screening between non-Latino Whites and Latinos have also increased. Even after accounting for socioeconomic factors, screening rates are lower for Latinos than for non-Latino Whites suggesting that there are other factors and barriers to CRC screening that are specific to Latinos.  A conceptual framework known as ""positive deviance"" is a particularly promising approach for addressing barriers to CRC screening among Latinos. The central premise behind positive deviance is that solutions to common problems found in a community often already exist in that community but they go unrecognized and so are underutilized. A positive deviance approach identifies behaviors associated with success and disseminates strategies for adopting these behaviors to others. When applied to CRC screening, this approach can identify specific barriers to screening as well as strategies to overcome these barriers. Video is an ideal medium for disseminating the strategies that ""positive deviants"" or ""successful peers"" use to overcome barriers to CRC screening. A positive deviance approach combined with video can thus capitalize on the screening behaviors of ""successful peers"" in a community and make behavioral interventions particularly relevant and culturally appropriate to others in that community.  The purpose of this proposal is to explore barriers to CRC screening encountered by Spanish-speaking Latino men, identify successful strategies used by successful peers to overcome barriers and in so doing, use a positive deviance approach to develop a culturally and linguistically appropriate tailored video-based intervention to increase CRC screening among Spanish-speaking Latino men.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer screening rates are low, especially among Latinos with limited English proficiency. ""Positive deviants"" or ""successful peers"" are those individuals in a community who practice a healthy behavior (e.g. colorectal cancer screening) when the majority do not. This project will use a ""positive deviance"" approach to create a culturally and linguistically appropriate innovative personalized video intervention to promote colorectal cancer screening among Spanish-speaking Latino men.

"The Impact of a Targeted CRC Screening Intervention among Latinos in Central PA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely recognized that colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most preventable cancers. If adenomatous polyps detected by screening were removed before they transformed into cancers, a decrease in new CRCs and in related mortality would follow. Unfortunately, cancer screening rates are low throughout Appalachia, including for Latino residents in PA. Further, Latinos are more likely to be diagnosed at later stage than Whites, have a lower survival rate and less access to quality treatment. Our long-term goal is to increase CRC screening uptake among Latinos in urban and rural central Pennsylvania (PA). Our central hypothesis is that a targeted CRC screening intervention can increase uptake over a non-targeted approach for this population. The specific objectives of the current proposal are to develop, implement and evaluate a targeted CRC screening intervention to increase CRC screening uptake. We will measure actual CRC uptake in both the control and intervention arm as a method to determinate completion rates. To prepare for my K01 application during my post-doc training, I led the design, implementation, and analysis of a CRC-related Latino study that provided preliminary data for theK01 work. In 04/09, utilizing the ACCN coalitions in PA, I conducted eight focus groups (FG) to identify barriers to CRC screenings among Latinos. We identified several substantial barriers to CRC screening for this population, including a significant barrier heretofore unmentioned in literature related to CRC screenings. Spanish-speaking patients want to have family members or close friends in the doctor office and health-related education classes. This barrier was reported across all groups and likely links to the desire for a strong social support that influences their CRC screening behavior. Another finding is that urban residents had some prior knowledge of risk factors associated with CRC screening while rural residents reported no prior knowledge and were unable to list any associated CRC risk factor. A high acceptability of the provider-recommended take-home fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for these Latinos was also reported. We exceeded our study recruitment goal. The same partnered Latino leaders are committed to the K01 proposed work. The K01 study design is a randomized, community-based, participatory design to determine completion of a provider-recommended, take-home FIT kit without (control) and with social support (intervention) among a sample of average-risk, urban and rural Appalachian Latino adults age 50 and older not currently adherent to national CRC screening guidelines (N=264).Each consented participant will attend a one-time, community- based CRC screening educational program offered at one of the eight study sites located in Central PA. The proposal is innovative because it combines provider-recommended FIT screening test with an education program and social support for Latinos in a randomized, community-based participatory research design. Further, it will provide preliminary data for evidence-based methods to increase CRC screening rates among Latinos throughout Appalachia, the focus of a future NIH NC1 R-series grant application.        In an effort to reduce this ethnic disparity among Latinos, screening rates among this population must increase. The specific objectives of the current proposal are to develop, implement and evaluate a multi-component targeted colorectal cancer (CRC) screening intervention to increase CRC screening uptake. The research will provide preliminary data for evidence-based methods to increase CRC screening rates among Latinos; and a future NIH NC1 R-series grant application.

"Geographic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Survival   ABSTRACT  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. Despite declines in CRC incidence rates, survival following diagnosis has improved only modestly over the past few decades. Even though environmental contexts play an important role in health, disease, and behavior, most studies about CRC survival have largely ignored the geographic variation and importance of area-level socioeconomic conditions that have been associated with CRC screening, CRC stage at diagnosis, and with the survival of many other cancers. CRC patients who live in areas with worse socioeconomic conditions have decreased survival than those who live under more affluent conditions; however, the mechanisms by which these area-level factors exert their influence on CRC survival remain unclear.  This amended application of the proposed population-based, prospective study has three specific aims. Aim 1) Determine the extent of the geographic variation of CRC survival across the United States based on small geographic areas at the sub-county (census-tract) level using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data for over 100,000 men and women aged 66 or older diagnosed with CRC. Aim 2) Determine the extent to which lower CRC survival can be explained by higher area socioeconomic deprivation among persons age 66 and older. Aim 3) Identify potential mediating pathways by which higher area socioeconomic deprivation is associated with lower CRC survival among persons age 66 and older, namely a) patient characteristics, b) physician and hospital characteristics, c) tumor characteristics, d) type of treatment received, and e) surveillance for CRC after diagnosis to detect recurrence and metastases.  A multilevel spatial model will be developed to address the specific aims of the proposed study. We will use the following existing data sources: 1) 1992-2005 data from NCI's SEER program (survival, patient characteristics, type of treatment, tumor characteristics); 2) 1991-2005 Medicare data (patient characteristics, type of treatment, surveillance after diagnosis) which is linked to the SEER data; 3) 1991-2005 data from the Provider of Services File (hospital and physician characteristics), 4) 1990-2005 census data (area deprivation measures), and 5) Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data. Advanced Bayesian spatial analyses of CRC survival will be performed and a geographic information system will be used to display the results. Our study will increase understanding of and identify important mechanisms of the role of area-level socioeconomic deprivation on CRC survival. In addition, this study will help provide opportunities for targeting specific geographic areas to allocate resources and interventions locally to improve CRC survival using evidence- based approaches, thereby reducing health disparities associated with living in socioeconomically deprived areas.  Narrative Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths. To reduce geographic disparities in survival following colorectal cancer and to develop and implement interventions that can be targeted locally, it is imperative to identify reasons for lower-than-expected survival.",Geographic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Survival,8303112,R01CA137750,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Behavior ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sound ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program ', ' SEER-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ', ' SEER Program (National Cancer Institute (U.S.)) ', ' SEER Program ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' stressor ', ' social ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' deprivation ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Age-Years ', ' NCCN ', ' National Comprehensive Cancer Network ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Study Section ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Older Population ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' beneficiary ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' aged ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' tumor ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,399775,0.2390023016330764
"African Americans and Colorectal Cancer: A Multilevel Model to Assess Factors for    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite evidence that early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) effectively prevents premature deaths, racial disparities in CRC persist and the gap is widening, especially among African Americans. Underutilization of cancer screening services often results in late stage diagnosis and higher mortality rates. Behavioral interventions to increase CRC screening have produced mixed results; therefore, a better understanding of factors that contribute to cancer health disparities is warranted. A review of the literature reveals four promising psychosocial/cultural factors: trust, social support, risk perception, and religiousness that have high potential to inform intervention research design. Additionally, as shown by empirical evidence, the behaviors of individuals and their social and physical environments are mutually influential. Since the study population resides in urban neighborhoods, characterized by poverty and racial residential segregation, a better understanding of neighborhood level factors contributing to cancer health disparities also is necessary. The literature shows interventions that take into account the environment of the individual are more likely to be successful. The proposed research will use a socio-ecologic framework to examine and understand both individual- and neighborhood-level factors associated with CRC screening. The proposed research has three specific aims:1) Investigate the associations among individual-level factors (e.g., psychosocial/cultural constructs, sociodemographics) and their relationship with CRC screening; 2) Characterize the associations among neighborhood-level factors (e.g., socioeconomic index, residential poverty, education, income) and their relationship with CRC screening; and 3) Explore the associations of individual-level factors, including perceptions of neighborhoods, and neighborhood-level factors with CRC screening using multi-level modeling. My ultimate aim is to build a research career focused on understanding the combined effects of individual and neighborhood level factors that may contribute to the development of scientifically sound and culturally relevant community-based interventions to increase CRC screening among African Americans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NIH encourages research that promotes an understanding of the factors contributing to cancer health disparities.

"Doctor-Patient Communication about Colorectal Cancer Screening and Health Dispari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this career development application is to launch an independent research program in cancer prevention and control with specific expertise in improving clinician-patient communication in underserved populations. Recent attention has been paid to the vital role of communication in clinical encounters and its effect on patient outcomes. In general, this research has not taken place with underserved populations, although patients in underserved populations have higher levels of mistrust of their clinicians, report lower levels of satisfaction with the encounter, and have poorer adherence. Given the import of clinician-patient communication and the emerging evidence about the effectiveness of interventions to improve clinician-patient communication, a more sophisticated understanding of communication between doctors and underserved patients and its impact on patient outcomes is required. Learning objectives for this career award include: 1) gain an increased understanding of the factors influencing health disparities in order to better plan studies and interpret results; 2) obtain a working knowledge of cancer epidemiology to inform my selection of outcome measures; 3) learn core principles for developing community interventions to change health behavior; 4) develop working relationships with researchers in health disparities through conference attendance and networking; 5) explore the communication between providers and low-income, minority patients with a focus on adherence to CRC screening; and 6) use a community-based participatory approach to obtain stakeholders' opinions about feasibility and acceptability of doctor-focused communication training interventions. Colorectal cancer screening will provide the paradigm for study in this application because of the disparities in both screening and cancer incidence by race, income, and education. The in-depth study of the effect of doctor-patient discussions about cancer screening will provide the opportunity to explore unique challenges faced in clinician-patient communication in underserved populations. Ultimately, this work will lead to the development of interventions to improve communication in these settings. Through intensive interaction with mentors and multi- disciplinary colleagues within a well-resourced institutional environment, formal coursework and educational activities, and the proposed research, this award will prepare me for a career as an independent researcher in doctor-patient communication and health disparities.

"Communicating Colorectal Cancer Prevention thru Urban African American Churches  Project Summary/Abstract African Americans, one of the largest minorities in the country fare worse in colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality when compared to several other races and often have negative perceptions to screening (Greiner, et al. 2005). Research indicates religion and spirituality as components that should be considered when appealing to individuals about health and making health decisions (Egbert, Mickley, Coeling, 2004). African Americans in particular are highly religious and also regularly attend church services more than any group in the country (Pew, 2007). The goals then of the proposed 5-year study are to obtain crucial preliminary data beyond the Minority Supplement that show the African American church as an important vehicle of cancer communication among African Americans. The central hypothesis of this overall research plan is that church-sponsored messages will have greater impact on cancer screening behavior outcome and will be more appealing to African Americans than traditional cancer- sponsored screening messages. The proposed research is innovative because it capitalizes on the church and prevalent social and cultural norms to socially market the product of CRC screening to promote healthy behavior among African Americans. The trust and social cohesion within the church will promote health messages to motivate or persuade individuals to perform cancer screening. The outcomes of this research will be novel information about how religion and church-sponsored materials relate to perceptions and attitudes; and how religion and the church in CRC cancer screening messages impact screening behavior among African Americans. The findings and results of the proposed interdisciplinary research will benefit African Americans' health because the outcomes will lead to improve health campaigns and communications to targeted populations at risk for cancer disparities. First, a series of qualitative studies among church pastors and congregants will be necessary to formulate a survey instrument to measure perceptions and attitudes about church-sponsored messages in CRC cancer communication materials disseminated via church networks and traditional media networks. Second, the newly developed instrument will be administered to a sample of church- going and church-affiliated individuals to further assess and quantify attitudes and perceptions. Third, a pilot intervention will be conducted to test the impact of church-sponsored messages on perceptions and CRC cancer preventive behaviors. This study is strategically designed to build new understanding of the impact of the church and religiosity on perceptions and behavior that will help the optimization of CRC cancer screening among this population.   Project Narrative African Americans die or suffer from colorectal cancer disproportionately when compared to other races in the U.S. Because African Americans are one of the largest groups that report high religious attendance, this study examines the influence of the African American church in increasing colorectal cancer screening among this population. The church is examined as a sponsor of cancer screening promotion compared to traditional cancer organizations (e.g. American Cancer Society) that promote prevention and screening.   __SpecificAimsTextDelimiter__  The Specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1. To elicit information on the social marketing concept and feasibility of a culturally and religiously-targeted CRC intervention on CRC screening promotion with pastor/church/community members via focus groups/interviews. Specific Aim 2. To conduct a pilot study in 8 churches to determine the feasibility of implementing a culturally and religiously-targeted CRC screening intervention in African American church-based settings and affiliated communities. Hypothesis 1: A targeted CRC screening (promotion) intervention will be feasible to implement in church settings. Hypothesis 1.1 A targeted CRC screening (promotion) intervention will be feasible to implement with groups affiliated with church communities. Specific Aim 3. To determine the effect of a culturally and religiously targeted CRC screening promotion intervention versus a standard information intervention in African American churches on CRC screening at 12 months among church and church-affiliated community members. Hypothesis 2: A culturally and religiously targeted CRC screening promotion intervention will result in an increase in behavior outcome for CRC screening versus a standard information intervention in African American church and church-affiliated populations.",Communicating Colorectal Cancer Prevention thru Urban African American Churches,8705626,K01CA164009,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2012,112169,0.21144442278388265
"Race, pathomolecular signature and colorectal cancer survival  ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd most common malignancy in the US and the third leading cause of cancer death. Compared to European Americans (EAs), African Americans (AAs) have a substantially higher CRC mortality rate that is a function of both a higher incidence rate and lower survival rate. Racial disparities in survival persist even after controlling for stage at diagnosis. The reasons for this are not known, but possible explanations include racial differences in aggressiveness of the tumors, socioeconomic variables, and or treatment-related factors. The training and research plan proposed in this K07 career development award will enable me to transition to the next phase of my academic career as an independent investigator in molecular and genetic cancer epidemiology. The training plan consists of several complementary activities including: (1) didactic training (formal coursework/workshops), (2) wet-laboratory experience, (3) attendance at national conferences and seminars (4) mentored clinical research and training in the responsible conduct of research. The primary goal of the research plan is to investigate the role of race, pathologic and molecular prognostic indicators and CRC survival. The research plan is carried out in two studies. In Aim one, a clinic-based study, we will perform a cross-sectional analysis to provide a comprehensive and accurate summary of the pathologic, molecular, and pathomolecular features of primary and metastatic tumors in AAs and EAs with CRC. Specifically, we will estimate the proportion of poor pathologic (e.g. histologic type, colonic location, grade) and molecular (e.g. KRAS, BRAF, p53, CIMP, MSI) prognostic indicators in AAs compared to EAs. In Aim 2, building on Aim 1, we will perform a survival analysis in a cohort of CRC patients to examine the joint influence of race and pathologic and molecular prognostic indicators on survival. Specifically, we will test the hypotheses that after adjustment for confounding variables, (a) younger (<50 years old) AAs compared to EAs will have a higher proportion of poor pathomolecular prognostic indicators and worse survival and (b) older (e 50 years old) AAs compared to EAs will have similar proportions of poor pathomolecular prognostic indicators and similar survival. The combination of the candidate's commitment to understanding the etiology of the racial disparity in colorectal neoplasia, the excellence and expertise of her mentoring team and the strong institutional commitment of the Medical University of South Carolina (a designated National Cancer Center) to reduce the racial disparities in cancer will help the applicant become an independent researcher. The research findings from the present proposal will culminate in a submission of an R01 in year 4 of the award. Ultimately, my goal is draw on the techniques in molecular and genetic epidemiology to reduce the disparities in incidence and survival between AAs and EAs in South Carolina and beyond.  Public Health Relevancy Statement Colorectal cancer is the source of significant morbidity and mortality especially among African Americans. Studies, like the one proposed, seek to understand the etiology of the racial disparities in colorectal cancer and hence provide insights into the mechanisms of the disease process. We envision the present proposal as part of the larger question of exploring, understanding, and improving outcomes among AA diagnosed with colorectal cancer.","Race, pathomolecular signature and colorectal cancer survival",8336843,K07CA151864,"['Age ', ' Age Factors ', ' Award ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' large bowel neoplasm ', ' colorectal neoplasia ', ' Large Intestine Tumor ', ' Large Intestine Neoplasm ', ' Large Bowel Tumor ', ' Colorectal Tumors ', ' Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' neoplasia ', ' Neoplasms ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Medical ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Staging ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Reporting ', ' v-raf Murine Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog B1 ', ' RAFB1 ', ' BRAF ', ' B-raf-1 ', ' BRAF gene ', ' response ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' v-Ki-RAS2 Kirsten Rat Sarcoma 2 Viral Oncogene Homolog ', ' RASK2 ', ' Oncogene K-Ras ', ' Ki-RAS ', ' KRAS2 ', ' KRAS ', ' K-Ras-2 Oncogene ', ' K-Ras 2A ', ' K-RAS2B ', ' K-RAS2A ', ' C-K-RAS ', ' KRAS2 gene ', ' Address ', ' CIMP ', ' CpG Island Methylator Phenotype ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' medically underserved ', ' tumor ', ' treatment response ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' ']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K07,2012,130083,0.08603826631732904
"Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening among African American    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Career Development Award will facilitate Dr. Richard C. Palmer's growth as an independent cancer prevention and control research scientist. The long-term career goal of the candidate is to translate research findings into effective health policy aimed at reducing health disparities. The candidate's immediate career goal is to establish himself as an interdisciplinary research scientist able to lead observational and intervention studies aimed at understanding and addressing cancer health disparities. To achieve this goal, the candidate proposes a career development plan that includes professional development, manuscript and grant preparation, and a research plan to collect pilot data. The proposed research plan extends the candidate's prior research work in colorectal cancer (CRC) and builds on work that the candidate has already conducted in addressing CRC disparities seen for African Americans. African Americans experience higher incidence and greater mortality from CRC in comparison to non-Hispanic whites and have low participation in CRC screening. Regular screening can reduce both morbidity and mortality from CRC and offers the possibility of early detection and prevention. Interventions to increase screening rates for African Americans are needed if parity is to be achieved. The primary goal of the proposed research will be to develop and test an interactive multimedia program that is aimed at increasing awareness about CRC, knowledge of testing options, decision-making, and increasing participation in CRC among African American primary care patients. To develop the interactive program, appropriate health messages promoting CRC screening will be developed and tested to examine their effect on attitudes toward CRC screening and behavioral intention. Once developed, a randomized trial will be conducted to assess the impact of the interactive multimedia program. This interactive multimedia application represents a novel approach to improving CRC screening behavior among African Americans in primary health care settings. If the interactive multimedia program is effective, it could be an inexpensive way to increase knowledge and compliance with CRC screening guidelines and other screening tests for this population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans have lower rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening participation and are more likely to die from the disease as compared to non-Hispanic whites and other racial/ethnic minorities. Consequently, interventions are needed to help address this inequity. This study will develop and test a multimedia intervention strategy aimed at increasing awareness of CRC, knowledge of testing options, and CRC screening participation among African American patients of a primary care clinic. If the multimedia education tool is effective, it could be an inexpensive way to increase compliance with CRC screening guidelines and possibly other cancer screening tests for this population.               7.

"Adding Hispanics to Ongoing GWAS in Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been instrumental in identifying a number of common susceptibility loci in Non Hispanic (NH)-White populations and a NCI priority is to extend GWAS findings to other populations to address racial/ethnic disparities in cancer susceptibility. Currently, GWA studies of CRC in NH-Whites, Japanese and African-Americans are ongoing. We propose a complementary study to address this critical research area in Hispanics. Hispanics represent the fastest growing ethnic population in the U.S. and have been largely understudied in terms of genetic susceptibility to cancer. There are noted differences in incidence, survival and mortality in CRC by ethnic/racial groups. Hispanics often present with CRC at a younger age and have a significantly greater incidence of stage IV tumors or metastatic disease compared to NH-Whites. We propose to conduct a large, cost-efficient, population-based GWAS in Hispanics by building upon existing NIH-funded resources, the Colon Cancer Family Registry (Colon CFR) and the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC). We plan to recruit 2,500 Hispanic men and women diagnosed with CRC between 01/2010 to 10/2013 using cancer registries in California. Risk factor/diet questionnaires, pathology reports, Oragene buccal samples (for genotyping) and tumor blocks (for MSI testing) will be collected using methodologies developed in the Colon CFR/MEC. Cases of CRC in the MEC (currently 473; anticipated 600 at end) will also be included. Population-based Hispanic individuals without a diagnosis of CRC participating in other GWA studies in the MEC (n=3,900, U01HG004726, Haiman) will be used as controls. We will genotype all 3,100 cases using the Illumina 1M array and use available genotype and epidemiologic data collected on 3,900 controls. Our statistical analyses will include: single-SNP and haplotype effects, gene-environment interactions and heterogeneity by MSI, tumor subtype and family history of CRC. We will replicate findings in a second-stage using CRC cases and controls from Mexico (1,000 cases and 1,000 controls, EU FP7 funding, CHIBCHA, Carvajal-Carmona/Tomlinson). We will also examine heterogeneity of the risk estimates by ethnicity/race by leveraging GWA data on NH-Whites (2,142 cases, 1,909 controls, U01 CA122839, Casey), (4,000 cases, 6,000 NH-White controls, UK-CHIBCHA, Tomlinson), Colombians (2,000 cases and 2,000 controls, CHIBCHA), Japanese (1,000 cases and 1,000 controls) and African-Americans (1,500 cases and 1,500 controls, R01CA126895, Le Marchand). We will genotype replicated significant SNPs in our main and combined analysis in several Hispanic populations (note: studies funded by EU or NIH for data collection but not GWAS) including: 800 Puerto Ricans, 2,000 Brazilians, 2,000 Argentineans and 3,000 Spanish/Portuguese to assess generalizability of findings. This study will have a high impact by addressing the key question of racial/ethnic disparities related to genetic susceptibility to CRC, and will enable further growth and investment into research among Hispanics by providing a resource of genetic data and biospecimens, which is lacking.        We propose to conduct a large population-based study to understand the role of the human genome in the etiology of colorectal cancer among Hispanics. The Hispanic population is the fastest growing ethnic population in the U.S. We also propose to investigate differences in genetic effects on risk of colorectal cancer across multiple races/ethnicities including Non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, Japanese and African-Americans. This study will address an important gap in genome-wide association studies of colorectal cancer in Hispanics and be able to evaluate differences in cancer susceptibility in different ethnic/racial groups.

"The Impact of a Targeted CRC Screening Intervention among Latinos in Central PA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely recognized that colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most preventable cancers. If adenomatous polyps detected by screening were removed before they transformed into cancers, a decrease in new CRCs and in related mortality would follow. Unfortunately, cancer screening rates are low throughout Appalachia, including for Latino residents in PA. Further, Latinos are more likely to be diagnosed at later stage than Whites, have a lower survival rate and less access to quality treatment. Our long-term goal is to increase CRC screening uptake among Latinos in urban and rural central Pennsylvania (PA). Our central hypothesis is that a targeted CRC screening intervention can increase uptake over a non-targeted approach for this population. The specific objectives of the current proposal are to develop, implement and evaluate a targeted CRC screening intervention to increase CRC screening uptake. We will measure actual CRC uptake in both the control and intervention arm as a method to determinate completion rates. To prepare for my K01 application during my post-doc training, I led the design, implementation, and analysis of a CRC-related Latino study that provided preliminary data for theK01 work. In 04/09, utilizing the ACCN coalitions in PA, I conducted eight focus groups (FG) to identify barriers to CRC screenings among Latinos. We identified several substantial barriers to CRC screening for this population, including a significant barrier heretofore unmentioned in literature related to CRC screenings. Spanish-speaking patients want to have family members or close friends in the doctor office and health-related education classes. This barrier was reported across all groups and likely links to the desire for a strong social support that influences their CRC screening behavior. Another finding is that urban residents had some prior knowledge of risk factors associated with CRC screening while rural residents reported no prior knowledge and were unable to list any associated CRC risk factor. A high acceptability of the provider-recommended take-home fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for these Latinos was also reported. We exceeded our study recruitment goal. The same partnered Latino leaders are committed to the K01 proposed work. The K01 study design is a randomized, community-based, participatory design to determine completion of a provider-recommended, take-home FIT kit without (control) and with social support (intervention) among a sample of average-risk, urban and rural Appalachian Latino adults age 50 and older not currently adherent to national CRC screening guidelines (N=264).Each consented participant will attend a one-time, community- based CRC screening educational program offered at one of the eight study sites located in Central PA. The proposal is innovative because it combines provider-recommended FIT screening test with an education program and social support for Latinos in a randomized, community-based participatory research design. Further, it will provide preliminary data for evidence-based methods to increase CRC screening rates among Latinos throughout Appalachia, the focus of a future NIH NC1 R-series grant application.        In an effort to reduce this ethnic disparity among Latinos, screening rates among this population must increase. The specific objectives of the current proposal are to develop, implement and evaluate a multi-component targeted colorectal cancer (CRC) screening intervention to increase CRC screening uptake. The research will provide preliminary data for evidence-based methods to increase CRC screening rates among Latinos; and a future NIH NC1 R-series grant application.

"Conjoint analysis to measure physician discrimination toward African Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Research Council defines discrimination as ""differential treatment on the basis of race that disadvantages a racial group."" Decades of research have found that well-intentioned physicians discriminate by providing unequal healthcare recommendations to minorities versus whites. Physicians' discrimination, though often unintentional, can play a significant role in creating and perpetuating disparities. The National Institute of Health (NIH) (PA-11-164) recognizes the critical need to empirically measure racial discrimination in healthcare in order to reduce health disparities. Despite the serious public health repercussions of physicians' discrimination, no gold standard assessment method has yet been developed to measure such discrimination. To date, the assessment methods that have been used to measure physicians' discrimination (e.g., self-report) have serious limitations (e.g., tainted by social desirability effects). Given the limitations in the previously studied assessment methods, PA-11-164 calls for research to ""improve the measurement of racial/ethnic discrimination in healthcare delivery"" in order to move toward eliminating the unequal treatment of minorities in our healthcare system. In direct response to this call for research, the proposed R03 aims to test an innovative assessment method, conjoint analysis, to examine the role of patients' race on physicians' treatment recommendations. Conjoint analysis is an assessment method that asks participants to respond to a series of computer-generated vignettes that vary on multiple factors (e.g., hypothetical patients' race, income, and health status). Conjoint analysis has the unique ability to overcome the limitations in the previously used assessment methods because: 1) it can detect socially undesirability effects (e.g., discrimination); and, 2) it has been found to be an excellent predictor of real worl behavior. For the proposed project, conjoint analysis will be used to detect physicians' discrimination against African Americans in the delivery of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations (i.e., colonoscopy, FOBT, FIT). Physicians' differing CRC screening recommendations can have direct consequences on CRC disparities. Aim 1 is to examine whether conjoint analysis can detect the role of patients' race on physicians' recommendations for CRC screenings. Aim 2 is to explore whether physicians' beliefs about patients' health behaviors (as determined by conjoint analysis) will mediate the relationship between patients' race and physicians' recommendations. Aim 3 is to explore whether physician characteristics (e.g., gender, race) moderate the relationship between patients' race and physicians' CRC screening recommendations. To achieve these aims, we will enroll 732 primary care physicians to participate in the conjoint study. The results of the R03 will contribute to the growing literatre on physicians' discrimination toward African Americans in recommending colorectal cancer screenings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If conjoint analysis proves to be a sound assessment method to detect physicians' discrimination in recommending CRC screenings, there is a strong argument for the widespread use of conjoint analysis to detect physicians' discrimination toward other racial/ethnic minority groups (e.g., Hispanics) and in other healthcare settings. The accurate measurement of physicians' discrimination can serve as an important step toward reducing the unequal treatment of minorities in our healthcare system, by providing the data necessary to develop targeted interventions.                ",Conjoint analysis to measure physician discrimination toward African Americans,8430262,R03CA173421,"['Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Laboratories ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Research Council ', ' National Research Council (U.S.) ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' Social Desirability ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' interest ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' ethnic discrimination ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Minority ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' computer generated ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R03,2013,84750,0.11849143082491372
"Effectiveness of Screening Colonoscopy in Reducing Deaths from Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers of the colon and rectum (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the US, can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques. Although some expert groups in the US consider colonoscopy to be the standard, there is currently only limited direct evidence to support its increasing use for screening in average risk adults. Colonoscopy has higher risks and costs than other screening tests. Recent studies reported that colonoscopy did not reduce mortality from right-sided colon cancers, the part of the colon that is beyond the reach of sigmoidoscopy. However, those findings were controversial because that study was unable to distinguish screening from diagnostic uses or accurately assess the completeness of colonoscopies. This project's goal is to inform clinical and policy decisions by providing evidence to show whether the purported benefits of colonoscopy are realized in practice. The primary specific aim is to estimate the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy in reducing death from CRC among average-risk adults when compared to no screening, overall and separately for right- and left-sided cancers. Our secondary aims are to: 1) determine the impact of the completeness of colonoscopy examinations on its effectiveness; and 2) compare the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy relative to sigmoidoscopy. We will use a case-control design nested in an historical cohort of persons receiving care at 3 sites participating in a research consortium, Cancer Research Network (CRN). These sites provide the full continuum of cancer care to their members ranging from screening through end of life care, and provide access to information on CRC screening that can be linked to diagnosis and cause-specific mortality data on large numbers of racially and socioeconomically diverse persons. We will identify at least 1,200 cases of CRC deaths between 2007 and 2014 among enrollees who were 52 years or older at the date of the diagnosis, each matched within each health plan to two randomly selected controls based on age, sex and enrollment history. We will identify screening history for a minimum of 10 years prior to cancer diagnosis, differentiating screening from diagnostic procedures, using standardized targeted chart reviews and other sources. The sample size will provide sufficient power for separate evaluations of tumors located in the right colon. This project will be carried out by an experienced interdisciplinary team representing epidemiology, case-control methodology, biostatistics, gastroenterology and primary care. Team members are national leaders in CRC screening research and policy. This project is in synergy with existing NCI and the CRN goals to: 1) develop methods and approaches to provide clinical, policy-relevant information; and 2) inform clinical and public health decisions on CRC screening. This application is also responsive to the NCI's priority to improve understanding of the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of tests used in screening for CRC, a ""health disparity condition"", and addresses Healthy People 2010 goals to reduce cancer death.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, but many of these cancers can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques. Although many people believe that colonoscopy is the best screening test, there is currently no scientific evidence to support that claim. The goal of our proposed study is to provide scientific evidence on whether current beliefs about the benefits of colonoscopy screening are realized in actual clinical practice in order to help patients, doctors, and policy makers make decisions about colon cancer screening.

"Adding Hispanics to Ongoing GWAS in Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been instrumental in identifying a number of common susceptibility loci in Non Hispanic (NH)-White populations and a NCI priority is to extend GWAS findings to other populations to address racial/ethnic disparities in cancer susceptibility. Currently, GWA studies of CRC in NH-Whites, Japanese and African-Americans are ongoing. We propose a complementary study to address this critical research area in Hispanics. Hispanics represent the fastest growing ethnic population in the U.S. and have been largely understudied in terms of genetic susceptibility to cancer. There are noted differences in incidence, survival and mortality in CRC by ethnic/racial groups. Hispanics often present with CRC at a younger age and have a significantly greater incidence of stage IV tumors or metastatic disease compared to NH-Whites. We propose to conduct a large, cost-efficient, population-based GWAS in Hispanics by building upon existing NIH-funded resources, the Colon Cancer Family Registry (Colon CFR) and the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC). We plan to recruit 2,500 Hispanic men and women diagnosed with CRC between 01/2010 to 10/2013 using cancer registries in California. Risk factor/diet questionnaires, pathology reports, Oragene buccal samples (for genotyping) and tumor blocks (for MSI testing) will be collected using methodologies developed in the Colon CFR/MEC. Cases of CRC in the MEC (currently 473; anticipated 600 at end) will also be included. Population-based Hispanic individuals without a diagnosis of CRC participating in other GWA studies in the MEC (n=3,900, U01HG004726, Haiman) will be used as controls. We will genotype all 3,100 cases using the Illumina 1M array and use available genotype and epidemiologic data collected on 3,900 controls. Our statistical analyses will include: single-SNP and haplotype effects, gene-environment interactions and heterogeneity by MSI, tumor subtype and family history of CRC. We will replicate findings in a second-stage using CRC cases and controls from Mexico (1,000 cases and 1,000 controls, EU FP7 funding, CHIBCHA, Carvajal-Carmona/Tomlinson). We will also examine heterogeneity of the risk estimates by ethnicity/race by leveraging GWA data on NH-Whites (2,142 cases, 1,909 controls, U01 CA122839, Casey), (4,000 cases, 6,000 NH-White controls, UK-CHIBCHA, Tomlinson), Colombians (2,000 cases and 2,000 controls, CHIBCHA), Japanese (1,000 cases and 1,000 controls) and African-Americans (1,500 cases and 1,500 controls, R01CA126895, Le Marchand). We will genotype replicated significant SNPs in our main and combined analysis in several Hispanic populations (note: studies funded by EU or NIH for data collection but not GWAS) including: 800 Puerto Ricans, 2,000 Brazilians, 2,000 Argentineans and 3,000 Spanish/Portuguese to assess generalizability of findings. This study will have a high impact by addressing the key question of racial/ethnic disparities related to genetic susceptibility to CRC, and will enable further growth and investment into research among Hispanics by providing a resource of genetic data and biospecimens, which is lacking.        We propose to conduct a large population-based study to understand the role of the human genome in the etiology of colorectal cancer among Hispanics. The Hispanic population is the fastest growing ethnic population in the U.S. We also propose to investigate differences in genetic effects on risk of colorectal cancer across multiple races/ethnicities including Non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, Japanese and African-Americans. This study will address an important gap in genome-wide association studies of colorectal cancer in Hispanics and be able to evaluate differences in cancer susceptibility in different ethnic/racial groups.

"Tailored Interactive Multimedia to Reduce Colorectal CA Screening Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interactive multimedia computer programs (IMCPs) show promise as a way of delivering personally tailored (PT) information to enhance cognitive mediators of health behavior and improve patient outcomes. However, it is unclear whether PT IMCPs can be deployed in primary care offices to increase cancer screening uptake and eliminate ethnic disparities in uptake by providing PT information in each user's preferred language. Aims/Hypotheses: We will compare changes in CRC screening cognitive mediators (self- efficacy, perceived barriers, and readiness) and uptake resulting from an IMCP  PT to enhance the key cognitive mediators and targeted to patients' self-identified ethnicity - with changes resulting from a non- tailored ""electronic leaflet"" control IMCP. The experimental and control IMCPs will each be offered in English and Spanish versions. We hypothesize that, compared with the appropriate control condition (English, Spanish, or both combined): (1) the English version of the PT IMCP will enhance the cognitive mediators of CRC screening behavior for English-speaking Hispanics and non-Hispanics; (2) there will be similarly favorable changes in these mediators for Hispanics using the Spanish version of the PT IMCP; (3) deployment of the PT IMCP will provide evidence of elimination of disparities in CRC screening between Hispanic and non-Hispanic subjects via its relative impact on the cognitive mediators in these groups; and (4) the PT IMCP (English and Spanish combined) will increase CRC screening uptake in Hispanics and non-Hispanics (considered separately) via changes in the cognitive mediators. Methods: Randomized controlled trial of 2 groups, comparing a PT (to the cognitive mediators) CRC screening IMCP offered in both English and Spanish versions and deployed before a primary care office visit with a non-tailored ""electronic leaflet"" CRC screening IMCP (control) also offered in both English and Spanish. Screening methods targeted will be fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. Primary outcomes will be CRC screening uptake, self- efficacy, perceived barriers, and readiness. Implications: Our findings will determine whether an IMCP that is PT to cognitive mediators of screening behavior and deployed in primary care offices prior to previously scheduled visits can activate patients of various ethnicities to undergo CRC screening. They may also suggest a promising, portable method of reducing disparities in CRC (and other) screening uptake between Hispanic and non-Hispanic individuals.

"CRC Screening Thoughts and Feelings: Increasing Engagement of African Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality of any ethnic/racial group. While screening, and particularly colonoscopy, is effective in reducing the incidence of CRC, adherence is low. In fact, a newly released modeling study suggests that disparities in screening accounts for over 40 percent of incidence disparities and almost 20 percent of mortality disparities. This is particularly true for African Americans; further, they are less likely to receive influential physician referrals for screening. There is a critical need to improve our understanding of adherence and the factors which influence African Americans' decisions about engaging in CRC screening, as well as efficacious intervention strategies. Behavioral research has shown links to cognitive decision-making factors (perceived benefits and barriers) and affective decision-making factors (fear and worry) in predicting CRC screening and intentions to screen. However, little or no work has systematically examined these factors in African Americans; this creates significant gaps in knowledge about the role of these factors in predicting (and potentially increasing) CRC screening for minorities. The goal of the proposed application is to understand factors influencing the decisions of African Americans to engage in (or not engage in) screening for CRC and the ability to positively impact these factors through intervention strategies at a community level. The central hypotheses are: a) that decisions to engage in CRC screening will be a function of both cognitive and affective factors; and b) that educational interventions can effectively alter both affective and cognitive factors and therefore increase CRC screening rates for African Americans. The Specific Aims proposed to test our hypotheses are: Aim 1: Examine the impact of two randomized community interventions on cognitive and affective factors and their resulting influence on health care seeking and CRC screening behaviors for African Americans. Aim 2: Examine and explore contextual factors that may influence the process of behavior change to better understand CRC screening and health care seeking behaviors at the community level. This study will significantly increase our understanding of factors which influence African Americans' decisions about health care seeking and CRC screening behavior and whether a community-based intervention can positively impact these factors and behaviors to reduce disparities. Expected outcomes: the work proposed in these aims will provide crucial information about behavioral change specific to health care seeking and CRC screening by African Americans.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is relevant to public health because it studies the factors which influence African Americans' decisions about engaging in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and the potential effectiveness of community-based outreach interventions to impact these decisions for African Americans who have an excess incidence and mortality rate from this disease.

"Modeling Effective Health Policies for Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is still the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States, despite the availability of a range of interventions to reduce the burden of CRC. Microsimulation modeling can inform policy makers in prioritizing among these cancer-control interventions. The CISNET-CRC team includes three collaborative modeling groups, each with a state-of-the-art, population-based microsimulation model for CRC: MISCAN, SimCRC, and CRC-SPIN. These three modeling groups have collaborated for eight years and have delivered a substantial body of policy-oriented work. We propose to continue this collaboration, further developing our models and using them to identify optimal cancer-control policies and practices to reduce the burden of CRC.      Our proposed work centers around three specific aims. In Aim 1 we extend our models to reflect the evolving understanding of the CRC disease processes and to incorporate new and updated screening modalities, allowing us to address new policy questions. Here we focus on new data on genomics, biomarkers, pathways, and the upcoming data from randomized controlled trials of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening. In Aim 2 we apply our updated models to inform health policy, including evaluation of interventions across the cancer-control spectrum. New technologies and more individually tailored screening and treatment strategies will be evaluated with a special focus on health disparities. In Aim 3 we disseminate results from our models to inform health policy, via methods that engage policy makers and encourage appropriate use of modeling in policy making and decision support. Here we envision innovation using open-access web-based model applications. We will begin with model extensions required for specific applications, with the balance of the work shifting heavily toward applications over the course of the funding period. Dissemination of our findings will occur throughout the funding period.

"Geographic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Survival   ABSTRACT  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. Despite declines in CRC incidence rates, survival following diagnosis has improved only modestly over the past few decades. Even though environmental contexts play an important role in health, disease, and behavior, most studies about CRC survival have largely ignored the geographic variation and importance of area-level socioeconomic conditions that have been associated with CRC screening, CRC stage at diagnosis, and with the survival of many other cancers. CRC patients who live in areas with worse socioeconomic conditions have decreased survival than those who live under more affluent conditions; however, the mechanisms by which these area-level factors exert their influence on CRC survival remain unclear.  This amended application of the proposed population-based, prospective study has three specific aims. Aim 1) Determine the extent of the geographic variation of CRC survival across the United States based on small geographic areas at the sub-county (census-tract) level using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data for over 100,000 men and women aged 66 or older diagnosed with CRC. Aim 2) Determine the extent to which lower CRC survival can be explained by higher area socioeconomic deprivation among persons age 66 and older. Aim 3) Identify potential mediating pathways by which higher area socioeconomic deprivation is associated with lower CRC survival among persons age 66 and older, namely a) patient characteristics, b) physician and hospital characteristics, c) tumor characteristics, d) type of treatment received, and e) surveillance for CRC after diagnosis to detect recurrence and metastases.  A multilevel spatial model will be developed to address the specific aims of the proposed study. We will use the following existing data sources: 1) 1992-2005 data from NCI's SEER program (survival, patient characteristics, type of treatment, tumor characteristics); 2) 1991-2005 Medicare data (patient characteristics, type of treatment, surveillance after diagnosis) which is linked to the SEER data; 3) 1991-2005 data from the Provider of Services File (hospital and physician characteristics), 4) 1990-2005 census data (area deprivation measures), and 5) Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data. Advanced Bayesian spatial analyses of CRC survival will be performed and a geographic information system will be used to display the results. Our study will increase understanding of and identify important mechanisms of the role of area-level socioeconomic deprivation on CRC survival. In addition, this study will help provide opportunities for targeting specific geographic areas to allocate resources and interventions locally to improve CRC survival using evidence- based approaches, thereby reducing health disparities associated with living in socioeconomically deprived areas.  Narrative Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths. To reduce geographic disparities in survival following colorectal cancer and to develop and implement interventions that can be targeted locally, it is imperative to identify reasons for lower-than-expected survival.",Geographic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Survival,8444701,R01CA137750,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Behavior ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sound ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program ', ' SEER-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ', ' SEER Program (National Cancer Institute (U.S.)) ', ' SEER Program ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' stressor ', ' social ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' deprivation ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Age-Years ', ' NCCN ', ' National Comprehensive Cancer Network ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Study Section ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Older Population ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' beneficiary ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' aged ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' tumor ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,145911,0.2390023016330764
"Effectiveness of Screening Colonoscopy in Reducing Deaths from Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers of the colon and rectum (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the US, can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques. Although some expert groups in the US consider colonoscopy to be the standard, there is currently only limited direct evidence to support its increasing use for screening in average risk adults. Colonoscopy has higher risks and costs than other screening tests. Recent studies reported that colonoscopy did not reduce mortality from right-sided colon cancers, the part of the colon that is beyond the reach of sigmoidoscopy. However, those findings were controversial because that study was unable to distinguish screening from diagnostic uses or accurately assess the completeness of colonoscopies. This project's goal is to inform clinical and policy decisions by providing evidence to show whether the purported benefits of colonoscopy are realized in practice. The primary specific aim is to estimate the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy in reducing death from CRC among average-risk adults when compared to no screening, overall and separately for right- and left-sided cancers. Our secondary aims are to: 1) determine the impact of the completeness of colonoscopy examinations on its effectiveness; and 2) compare the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy relative to sigmoidoscopy. We will use a case-control design nested in an historical cohort of persons receiving care at 3 sites participating in a research consortium, Cancer Research Network (CRN). These sites provide the full continuum of cancer care to their members ranging from screening through end of life care, and provide access to information on CRC screening that can be linked to diagnosis and cause-specific mortality data on large numbers of racially and socioeconomically diverse persons. We will identify at least 1,200 cases of CRC deaths between 2007 and 2014 among enrollees who were 52 years or older at the date of the diagnosis, each matched within each health plan to two randomly selected controls based on age, sex and enrollment history. We will identify screening history for a minimum of 10 years prior to cancer diagnosis, differentiating screening from diagnostic procedures, using standardized targeted chart reviews and other sources. The sample size will provide sufficient power for separate evaluations of tumors located in the right colon. This project will be carried out by an experienced interdisciplinary team representing epidemiology, case-control methodology, biostatistics, gastroenterology and primary care. Team members are national leaders in CRC screening research and policy. This project is in synergy with existing NCI and the CRN goals to: 1) develop methods and approaches to provide clinical, policy-relevant information; and 2) inform clinical and public health decisions on CRC screening. This application is also responsive to the NCI's priority to improve understanding of the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of tests used in screening for CRC, a ""health disparity condition"", and addresses Healthy People 2010 goals to reduce cancer death.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, but many of these cancers can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques. Although many people believe that colonoscopy is the best screening test, there is currently no scientific evidence to support that claim. The goal of our proposed study is to provide scientific evidence on whether current beliefs about the benefits of colonoscopy screening are realized in actual clinical practice in order to help patients, doctors, and policy makers make decisions about colon cancer screening.

"Racial Disparity in Colorectal Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now well recognized that African Americans (AAs) exhibit disproportionately higher incidence and mortality rates for colorectal cancer (CRC) than European Americans/Caucasians (CAs). Also, black women are more likely to die from CRC than women in any other racial group and black men are even more likely to die from CRC than black women (Ginsburg CH, Clin Gastroentrol Hepatol 9: 859-61, 2011). Despite this grim outlook, little is known about the molecular and biochemical mechanisms for the racial disparity in CRC. Our ongoing mutation analysis of Apc and b-catenin genes revealed higher incidence of mutation of both Apc and b-catenin in colonic biopsies from AAs than CAs. Since cancer stem/stem-like cells (CSCs/CSLCs) are thought to be critically involved in the development and progression of many malignancies, including CRC, we also investigated whether the difference in CRC between AAs and CAs could partly be attributed to changes in CSCs/CSLCs. We observed that colon CSCs/CSLCs, specifically the proportion of CD44+CD166- phenotype, was markedly higher in colonic effluent, collected during colonoscopy, of AAs with adenomas than their CA counterparts. This increase was accompanied by a concomitant rise colonic mucosal microRNA-21 (miR-21), which has been shown to regulate CSCs/CSLCs. We hypothesize that the high incidence of CRC in AAs could be due to an increase in CSCs/CSLCs in the colon, in particular those with CD44+CD166- phenotype that exhibit increased mutation of tumor suppressor and/or proto-oncogenes, specifically Apc, k-ras and/or b- catenin. We will test this hypothesis by examining the mutational status of Apc, K-ras and/or b-catenin in CD44+CD166- CSCs/CSLCs, isolated from colonic biopsies and colonic effluent of AAs and CAs subjects with and without adenomas (Specific Aim 1). We also hypothesize that microRNA-21 (miR-21) plays a critical role in regulating colon CSCs/CSLCs. We will test this hypothesis (a) by examining the levels of miR-21 in CSCs/CSLCs, specifically in CD44+CD166- phenotype isolated from the normal appearing mucosa and colonic effluent of AAs and CAs with and without adenomas and also (b) by carrying out in vitro studies to examine the extent of changes in the proportion of CD44+CD166- phenotype following downregulation of miR- 21 (Specific Aim 2). Lastly, we will examine whether overall CSCs/CSLCs as well as CD44+CD166- phenotype isolated from normal appearing mucosa and colonic effluent of AAs with adenomatous polyps will possess greater tumorigenic properties in vitro and in vivo in SCID mice, compared to those from CAs (Specific Aim 3). The proposed study would not only give us a better understanding of the biological basis for the higher prevalence of CRC among AAs but would also lead to a new stratification strategy that would allow a better targeting of limited resources into screening of patients at the highest risk more intensely than those at lower risk.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although African Americans (AAs) have higher incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) and greater mortality from this disease than Caucasian Americans (CAs), little is known about the molecular mechanisms for the racial disparity in CRC. The proposed investigation is aimed at testing the hypothesis that the high incidence of CRC in AAs is due to an increase in self- renewing cancer stem or stem-like cells in the colon that exhibit increased mutations of genes, responsible for the development and progression of CRC and an increase in microRNA-21 that regulates cancer stem/stem-like cells. The proposed study would not only give us a better understanding of the biological basis for the higher prevalence of CRC among AAs, but could allow a better targeting of limited resources into screening of patients at the highest risk more intensely than those at lower risk.            ",Racial Disparity in Colorectal Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms,8492513,R21CA175916,"['adenoma ', ' Age ', ' Biopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Cells ', ' Colon ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genes ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mucosal Tissue ', ' Mucosa ', ' Mucous Membrane ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' protooncogene ', ' c-ONC ', ' Cellular Oncogene ', ' Proto-Oncogenes ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' regenerate ', ' Regeneration ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' severe combined immune deficiency ', ' Severe Combined Immunodeficient Mice ', ' SCID Mice ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' polypoid adenoma ', ' Adenomatous Polyps ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' European ', ' Gastroenterologist ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Pathologist ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' tumor suppressor ', ' Tumor Suppressor Proteins ', ' cohort ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Reporting ', ' Mutation Analysis ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' MEMD ', ' CD166 ', ' ALCAM ', ' ALCAM gene ', ' Pgp1 ', ' MDU3 ', ' CD44 ', ' CD44 gene ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Stratification ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' tumorigenic ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' self-renew ', ' self-renewal ', ' stemness ', ' stem ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,164430,0.11100351538235427
"Doctor-Patient Communication about Colorectal Cancer Screening and Health Dispari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this career development application is to launch an independent research program in cancer prevention and control with specific expertise in improving clinician-patient communication in underserved populations. Recent attention has been paid to the vital role of communication in clinical encounters and its effect on patient outcomes. In general, this research has not taken place with underserved populations, although patients in underserved populations have higher levels of mistrust of their clinicians, report lower levels of satisfaction with the encounter, and have poorer adherence. Given the import of clinician-patient communication and the emerging evidence about the effectiveness of interventions to improve clinician-patient communication, a more sophisticated understanding of communication between doctors and underserved patients and its impact on patient outcomes is required. Learning objectives for this career award include: 1) gain an increased understanding of the factors influencing health disparities in order to better plan studies and interpret results; 2) obtain a working knowledge of cancer epidemiology to inform my selection of outcome measures; 3) learn core principles for developing community interventions to change health behavior; 4) develop working relationships with researchers in health disparities through conference attendance and networking; 5) explore the communication between providers and low-income, minority patients with a focus on adherence to CRC screening; and 6) use a community-based participatory approach to obtain stakeholders' opinions about feasibility and acceptability of doctor-focused communication training interventions. Colorectal cancer screening will provide the paradigm for study in this application because of the disparities in both screening and cancer incidence by race, income, and education. The in-depth study of the effect of doctor-patient discussions about cancer screening will provide the opportunity to explore unique challenges faced in clinician-patient communication in underserved populations. Ultimately, this work will lead to the development of interventions to improve communication in these settings. Through intensive interaction with mentors and multi- disciplinary colleagues within a well-resourced institutional environment, formal coursework and educational activities, and the proposed research, this award will prepare me for a career as an independent researcher in doctor-patient communication and health disparities.

"Race, pathomolecular signature and colorectal cancer survival  ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd most common malignancy in the US and the third leading cause of cancer death. Compared to European Americans (EAs), African Americans (AAs) have a substantially higher CRC mortality rate that is a function of both a higher incidence rate and lower survival rate. Racial disparities in survival persist even after controlling for stage at diagnosis. The reasons for this are not known, but possible explanations include racial differences in aggressiveness of the tumors, socioeconomic variables, and or treatment-related factors. The training and research plan proposed in this K07 career development award will enable me to transition to the next phase of my academic career as an independent investigator in molecular and genetic cancer epidemiology. The training plan consists of several complementary activities including: (1) didactic training (formal coursework/workshops), (2) wet-laboratory experience, (3) attendance at national conferences and seminars (4) mentored clinical research and training in the responsible conduct of research. The primary goal of the research plan is to investigate the role of race, pathologic and molecular prognostic indicators and CRC survival. The research plan is carried out in two studies. In Aim one, a clinic-based study, we will perform a cross-sectional analysis to provide a comprehensive and accurate summary of the pathologic, molecular, and pathomolecular features of primary and metastatic tumors in AAs and EAs with CRC. Specifically, we will estimate the proportion of poor pathologic (e.g. histologic type, colonic location, grade) and molecular (e.g. KRAS, BRAF, p53, CIMP, MSI) prognostic indicators in AAs compared to EAs. In Aim 2, building on Aim 1, we will perform a survival analysis in a cohort of CRC patients to examine the joint influence of race and pathologic and molecular prognostic indicators on survival. Specifically, we will test the hypotheses that after adjustment for confounding variables, (a) younger (<50 years old) AAs compared to EAs will have a higher proportion of poor pathomolecular prognostic indicators and worse survival and (b) older (e 50 years old) AAs compared to EAs will have similar proportions of poor pathomolecular prognostic indicators and similar survival. The combination of the candidate's commitment to understanding the etiology of the racial disparity in colorectal neoplasia, the excellence and expertise of her mentoring team and the strong institutional commitment of the Medical University of South Carolina (a designated National Cancer Center) to reduce the racial disparities in cancer will help the applicant become an independent researcher. The research findings from the present proposal will culminate in a submission of an R01 in year 4 of the award. Ultimately, my goal is draw on the techniques in molecular and genetic epidemiology to reduce the disparities in incidence and survival between AAs and EAs in South Carolina and beyond.  Public Health Relevancy Statement Colorectal cancer is the source of significant morbidity and mortality especially among African Americans. Studies, like the one proposed, seek to understand the etiology of the racial disparities in colorectal cancer and hence provide insights into the mechanisms of the disease process. We envision the present proposal as part of the larger question of exploring, understanding, and improving outcomes among AA diagnosed with colorectal cancer.","Race, pathomolecular signature and colorectal cancer survival",8538888,K07CA151864,"['Age ', ' Age Factors ', ' Award ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' large bowel neoplasm ', ' colorectal neoplasia ', ' Large Intestine Tumor ', ' Large Intestine Neoplasm ', ' Large Bowel Tumor ', ' Colorectal Tumors ', ' Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' neoplasia ', ' Neoplasms ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Medical ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Staging ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Reporting ', ' v-raf Murine Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog B1 ', ' RAFB1 ', ' BRAF ', ' B-raf-1 ', ' BRAF gene ', ' response ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' v-Ki-RAS2 Kirsten Rat Sarcoma 2 Viral Oncogene Homolog ', ' RASK2 ', ' Oncogene K-Ras ', ' Ki-RAS ', ' KRAS2 ', ' KRAS ', ' K-Ras-2 Oncogene ', ' K-Ras 2A ', ' K-RAS2B ', ' K-RAS2A ', ' C-K-RAS ', ' KRAS2 gene ', ' Address ', ' CIMP ', ' CpG Island Methylator Phenotype ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' medically underserved ', ' tumor ', ' treatment response ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' ']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K07,2013,129249,0.08603826631732904
"Genetic Association Studies in African American Colorectal Cancer Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant cause of cancer morbidity and mortality affecting almost 150,000 Americans yearly. African Americans have the highest CRC incidence and mortality of all US populations. These disparities have not been explained, and biological risk factors including genetic susceptibility to CRC are understudied in African Americans. I am a gastroenterologist who seeks to develop a career as an independent translational physician-scientist in CRC genetics. My long-term career goals require me to obtain additional training in: 1) molecular and statistical genetics; and 2) cancer biology. The 5-year career development program described in this application will take place at the University of Chicago which distinguishes itself in the field of human and cancer genetics especially in admixed populations. I am fortunate to have key collaborators at the University of North Carolina and the University of Illinois Chicago, and together we have DNA from over 1000 African American CRC patients and 1000 African American control subjects available for my proposed study. Dr. Nancy Cox, Professor of Medicine and Chief of Human Genetics, is my mentor and will provide expertise in statistical genetics. Dr. Nathan Ellis, Associate Professor of Medicine, is a co-mentor and will provide expertise in CRC molecular genetics. An inter-disciplinary Advisory Committee comprised of Dr. Rick Kittles, an expert in genetics of admixed populations, Dr. Olufunmilayo Olopade, an internationally recognized leader in cancer genetics, and Dr. Eugene Chang, a successful physician-scientist in gastroenterology, will guide and advise me during this development period. The broad objectives of this research proposal are the identification of genetic susceptibility factors that contribute to risk of CRC development in African Americans. I will study single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered using genome-wide association studies in European populations. Regions containing these SNP are likely to harbor functional variants. African Americans are an ideal population in whom to identify functional variants because their genomes exhibit less linkage disequilibrium. To this end, I propose three specific aims: 1) Validate candidate CRC-associated regions in African American cases and controls; 2) Discover novel SNPs in CRC-associated regions by targeted resequencing using next-generation sequencing technologies; and 3) Identify putative functional variants in candidate CRC-associated regions that can be further evaluated in future functional studies. By the end of my career development period, I will be uniquely equipped to undertake further translational research in CRC genetics. My long-term research goals are to understand genetic susceptibility in CRC pathogenesis and to study how genetic susceptibility factors can be used to risk stratify individuals for CRC screening and thereby prevent disease especially in high risk but understudied populations like African Americans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of all US populations, African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer. Reasons for these differences are not explained, and hereditary factors have not been extensively studied in this high risk population. The goal of our study is to better understand hereditary factors that increase risk of colorectal cancer especially in African-Americans.           Project Narrative Of all US populations, African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer.

"Strategies and Opportunities to Stop Colon Cancer in Priority Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The federal government has set a Healthy People 2020 goal of a 70.5% screening rate for colorectal cancer (CRC), but almost half of eligible U.S. adults are not up to date on their screenings. Among minority and low-income populations, the CRC screening rate is extremely low. To address this disparity, we will develop and test a culturally tailored, health care system-based program to improve CRC screening rates in OCHIN, a community-based collaborative network of more than 200 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). Racial and ethnic minorities, along with low-income and medically underserved populations, increasingly receive their primary care at FQHCs, which serve nearly 19 million patients annually throughout the United States. OCHIN is the largest national FQHC network. Its integrated electronic health record system combining medical, laboratory, and claims data will serve as a novel and robust data source for our study. In Phase I (Year 01), we will pilot-test an evidence-based approach to improving participation in CRC screening in two OCHIN FQHCs. This phase will include an assessment of the intervention's feasibility, effectiveness, and cost. In Phase II (Years 02-05), we will conduct a comparative effectiveness pragmatic clinical trial, using a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of our CRC screening program designed explicitly for FQHC clinics. Throughout the project, we will work with a diverse planning advisory group of OCHIN clinicians and patients, community representatives, state policy makers, and researchers, using principles of Community-Based Participatory Research.  Because OCHIN is the largest single FQHC network and serves patients who are diverse in race, ethnicity, and insurance status, our results will play a transformative role in accelerating CRC screening research in underserved populations. Our program will expand meaningful use of electronic health information; synergistically meet national goals to improve cancer screening rates, address health disparities, and reduce health care costs; and act as a catalyst for future systems-based approaches to improve care delivery in FQHCs and other health systems.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Rates of CRC screening are extremely low in patients at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which serve nearly 19 million patients annually. We will test an intervention to improve rates of CRC screening in a group of FQHCs.

"Tailored Touchscreen Colorectal Cancer Prevention in American Indian Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality disproportionately impacts minorities.  Few studies have addressed screening among specific minority populations such as American Indians (AI).  This study will assess the efficacy of a novel tailored touch screen computer intervention based on an innovative integration of the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) and the concept of ""implementation intentions,"" a recent elaboration of the Theory of Planned Behavior.  The majority of the intervention will be delivered in tribal clinics and primary care settings on low-cost touch screen computers through multimedia audio-narrative and video messages.  Studies have not tested the effectiveness of culturally tailored communications specified to stated ""implementation intentions"" for improving CRC screening in this group.  A randomized design will test a comparison condition of generic information versus a  multimedia tailored intervention that specifically addresses each participant's screening test modality  preference, current CRC screening decisional stage (PAPM), and CRC screening ""implementation  intentions"" (the ""when"", ""where"" and ""how"" details of screening).  Behavioral intervention materials will be developed with the help of cultural experts, a pilot test, and from data gathered in a prior focus group study we used to assess key influences on CRC screening for AIs.  The study will be conducted with 460 AI patients eligible for CRC screening and recruited while presenting for care in tribal or regional safety-net clinics.  All participants will receive a baseline touch screen administered assessment and, depending on stated preference, be offered either an immunochemical fecal occult blood test (iFOBT-InSure TM) or colonoscopy.  Participants will be randomized to either C (comparison group-computer  delivered generic CRC information) or AI2 (active intervention-computer delivered culturally tailored  messaging based on individual PAPM stage, behavior constructs, and ""Implementation Intentions"").  A brief office exit survey will assess patient-provider discussions of CRC screening and satisfaction with computerized message materials.           Colorectal Cancer is a major cause of cancer mortality and late stage presentation is common among minorities. American Indians, receive colorectal cancer screening at very low rates and face important cultural barriers to care in the health care system. This study is relevant to overarching approaches to reduce AI cancer health disparities because it tests a novel behavioral intervention and culturally tailored materials to improve rates of colorectal cancer screening in this underserved population group.

"MODELING SPATIAL ACCESSIBILITY TO LOWER ENDOSCOPY SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Lower endoscopic examinations including flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy have been demonstrated to reduce the risks of incident CRC and CRC-specific mortality through detection and removal of precancerous lesions and early detection of CRC. However, lower endoscopy utilization is still less than 60% among persons aged 50 years or older.  Previous research identified significant geographic variations in CRC screening, incidence, and survival. Small-area socioeconomic deprivation has been associated with CRC-related outcomes, but was unable to explain the observed geographic disparity in CRC-related outcomes, suggesting that other community-level characteristics contribute to geographic disparities in CRC-related outcomes. Access to healthcare is an important prerequisite to obtaining quality care and thus a determinant of health outcomes. Low spatial accessibility to mammography service has been associated with an increased risk of late-stage breast cancer. Little is known whether spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services contributes to the geographic variation in CRC-related outcomes. Therefore, we will explore the hypothesis that geographic disparities in CRC screening, incidence and survival are attributable to spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services. Two specific aims will be addressed: (1) Compute and map small-area spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services across the United States including 50 states and Washington DC, using a GIS, Medicare data, and spatial statistical modeling, and (2) Examine the effects of small-area spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services on CRC-related outcomes, including the risks of incident CRC, advanced stage at diagnosis, and CRC-specific mortality.  We will use three different spatial approaches to quantify and map small-area spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services based on the locations of physicians who performed a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy using Medicare data. Then, we will link the small-area spatial accessibility measures with data from the high- quality NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study including 566,407 persons to prospectively assess the effects of spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services on CRC incidence, advanced stage at diagnosis and CRC- specific mortality. This is the first study to examine the geographic disparity in spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services and prospectively evaluate its effect on CRC outcomes. The results of the proposed study will provide evidence for the development and implementation of evidence-based multilevel interventions to increase lower endoscopy use and thus improve CRC-related outcomes. In addition, the proposed study will develop a spatial accessibility map which will help local and state policy makers improve the allocation of lower endoscopy services.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths while lower endoscopy examinations are effective approaches for CRC prevention and control. To improve the accessibility equity in lower endoscopy services, it is essential to accurately measure the spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services and to determine the extent to which it impacts on CRC incidence and mortality.                ",MODELING SPATIAL ACCESSIBILITY TO LOWER ENDOSCOPY SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES,8504297,R21CA169807,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Belief ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Promoting Colorectal Cancer Screening in Rural Emergency Departments     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural Appalachian Kentuckians suffer a disproportionate incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer death. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that as many as 60 percent of CRC related deaths could be prevented if everyone age 50 and older were screened regularly. Rural Appalachian residents are currently being screened at suboptimal rates. The proposed intervention builds on our successful cancer prevention projects: Faith Moves Mountains: A CBPR Appalachian Wellness and Cancer Prevention Program and Promoting Mammography among African American Women Visiting the Emergency Departments. Both projects involve lay health advisor (LHA) delivered motivational interviewing interventions that have been culturally tailored. We propose to pilot test a culturally tailored intervention using brief motivational interviewing by LHAs to promote CRC screenings in an emergency department (ED) serving rural Appalachian Kentucky in order to (1) evaluate the feasibility of the intervention in this rurl Appalachian setting; and (2) assess the effects of the intervention on perceived barriers to CRC screening and subsequent cancer screening engagement.  Consistent with our current Faith Moves Mountains and Promoting Mammography projects, we will train carefully selected community members (LHAs) to deliver a brief motivational interview while participants wait for non-urgent care in the ED or wait with a family member who is receiving care. Each participant, in conjunction with the LHA, will develop a written plan of action that addresses their identified barriers to screening. The brief intervention will take about 15 minutes and will be delivered in a private area of the ED.

"CRC Screening Thoughts and Feelings: Increasing Engagement of African Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality of any ethnic/racial group. While screening, and particularly colonoscopy, is effective in reducing the incidence of CRC, adherence is low. In fact, a newly released modeling study suggests that disparities in screening accounts for over 40 percent of incidence disparities and almost 20 percent of mortality disparities. This is particularly true for African Americans; further, they are less likely to receive influential physician referrals for screening. There is a critical need to improve our understanding of adherence and the factors which influence African Americans' decisions about engaging in CRC screening, as well as efficacious intervention strategies. Behavioral research has shown links to cognitive decision-making factors (perceived benefits and barriers) and affective decision-making factors (fear and worry) in predicting CRC screening and intentions to screen. However, little or no work has systematically examined these factors in African Americans; this creates significant gaps in knowledge about the role of these factors in predicting (and potentially increasing) CRC screening for minorities. The goal of the proposed application is to understand factors influencing the decisions of African Americans to engage in (or not engage in) screening for CRC and the ability to positively impact these factors through intervention strategies at a community level. The central hypotheses are: a) that decisions to engage in CRC screening will be a function of both cognitive and affective factors; and b) that educational interventions can effectively alter both affective and cognitive factors and therefore increase CRC screening rates for African Americans. The Specific Aims proposed to test our hypotheses are: Aim 1: Examine the impact of two randomized community interventions on cognitive and affective factors and their resulting influence on health care seeking and CRC screening behaviors for African Americans. Aim 2: Examine and explore contextual factors that may influence the process of behavior change to better understand CRC screening and health care seeking behaviors at the community level. This study will significantly increase our understanding of factors which influence African Americans' decisions about health care seeking and CRC screening behavior and whether a community-based intervention can positively impact these factors and behaviors to reduce disparities. Expected outcomes: the work proposed in these aims will provide crucial information about behavioral change specific to health care seeking and CRC screening by African Americans.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is relevant to public health because it studies the factors which influence African Americans' decisions about engaging in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and the potential effectiveness of community-based outreach interventions to impact these decisions for African Americans who have an excess incidence and mortality rate from this disease.

"Communicating Colorectal Cancer Prevention thru Urban African American Churches  Project Summary/Abstract African Americans, one of the largest minorities in the country fare worse in colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality when compared to several other races and often have negative perceptions to screening (Greiner, et al. 2005). Research indicates religion and spirituality as components that should be considered when appealing to individuals about health and making health decisions (Egbert, Mickley, Coeling, 2004). African Americans in particular are highly religious and also regularly attend church services more than any group in the country (Pew, 2007). The goals then of the proposed 5-year study are to obtain crucial preliminary data beyond the Minority Supplement that show the African American church as an important vehicle of cancer communication among African Americans. The central hypothesis of this overall research plan is that church-sponsored messages will have greater impact on cancer screening behavior outcome and will be more appealing to African Americans than traditional cancer- sponsored screening messages. The proposed research is innovative because it capitalizes on the church and prevalent social and cultural norms to socially market the product of CRC screening to promote healthy behavior among African Americans. The trust and social cohesion within the church will promote health messages to motivate or persuade individuals to perform cancer screening. The outcomes of this research will be novel information about how religion and church-sponsored materials relate to perceptions and attitudes; and how religion and the church in CRC cancer screening messages impact screening behavior among African Americans. The findings and results of the proposed interdisciplinary research will benefit African Americans' health because the outcomes will lead to improve health campaigns and communications to targeted populations at risk for cancer disparities. First, a series of qualitative studies among church pastors and congregants will be necessary to formulate a survey instrument to measure perceptions and attitudes about church-sponsored messages in CRC cancer communication materials disseminated via church networks and traditional media networks. Second, the newly developed instrument will be administered to a sample of church- going and church-affiliated individuals to further assess and quantify attitudes and perceptions. Third, a pilot intervention will be conducted to test the impact of church-sponsored messages on perceptions and CRC cancer preventive behaviors. This study is strategically designed to build new understanding of the impact of the church and religiosity on perceptions and behavior that will help the optimization of CRC cancer screening among this population.    Project Narrative African Americans die or suffer from colorectal cancer disproportionately when compared to other races in the U.S. Because African Americans are one of the largest groups that report high religious attendance, this study examines the influence of the African American church in increasing colorectal cancer screening among this population. The church is examined as a sponsor of cancer screening promotion compared to traditional cancer organizations (e.g. American Cancer Society) that promote prevention and screening.

"The Impact of a Targeted CRC Screening Intervention among Latinos in Central PA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely recognized that colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most preventable cancers. If adenomatous polyps detected by screening were removed before they transformed into cancers, a decrease in new CRCs and in related mortality would follow. Unfortunately, cancer screening rates are low throughout Appalachia, including for Latino residents in PA. Further, Latinos are more likely to be diagnosed at later stage than Whites, have a lower survival rate and less access to quality treatment. Our long-term goal is to increase CRC screening uptake among Latinos in urban and rural central Pennsylvania (PA). Our central hypothesis is that a targeted CRC screening intervention can increase uptake over a non-targeted approach for this population. The specific objectives of the current proposal are to develop, implement and evaluate a targeted CRC screening intervention to increase CRC screening uptake. We will measure actual CRC uptake in both the control and intervention arm as a method to determinate completion rates. To prepare for my K01 application during my post-doc training, I led the design, implementation, and analysis of a CRC-related Latino study that provided preliminary data for theK01 work. In 04/09, utilizing the ACCN coalitions in PA, I conducted eight focus groups (FG) to identify barriers to CRC screenings among Latinos. We identified several substantial barriers to CRC screening for this population, including a significant barrier heretofore unmentioned in literature related to CRC screenings. Spanish-speaking patients want to have family members or close friends in the doctor office and health-related education classes. This barrier was reported across all groups and likely links to the desire for a strong social support that influences their CRC screening behavior. Another finding is that urban residents had some prior knowledge of risk factors associated with CRC screening while rural residents reported no prior knowledge and were unable to list any associated CRC risk factor. A high acceptability of the provider-recommended take-home fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for these Latinos was also reported. We exceeded our study recruitment goal. The same partnered Latino leaders are committed to the K01 proposed work. The K01 study design is a randomized, community-based, participatory design to determine completion of a provider-recommended, take-home FIT kit without (control) and with social support (intervention) among a sample of average-risk, urban and rural Appalachian Latino adults age 50 and older not currently adherent to national CRC screening guidelines (N=264).Each consented participant will attend a one-time, community- based CRC screening educational program offered at one of the eight study sites located in Central PA. The proposal is innovative because it combines provider-recommended FIT screening test with an education program and social support for Latinos in a randomized, community-based participatory research design. Further, it will provide preliminary data for evidence-based methods to increase CRC screening rates among Latinos throughout Appalachia, the focus of a future NIH NC1 R-series grant application.        In an effort to reduce this ethnic disparity among Latinos, screening rates among this population must increase. The specific objectives of the current proposal are to develop, implement and evaluate a multi-component targeted colorectal cancer (CRC) screening intervention to increase CRC screening uptake. The research will provide preliminary data for evidence-based methods to increase CRC screening rates among Latinos; and a future NIH NC1 R-series grant application.

"Geographic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Survival   ABSTRACT  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. Despite declines in CRC incidence rates, survival following diagnosis has improved only modestly over the past few decades. Even though environmental contexts play an important role in health, disease, and behavior, most studies about CRC survival have largely ignored the geographic variation and importance of area-level socioeconomic conditions that have been associated with CRC screening, CRC stage at diagnosis, and with the survival of many other cancers. CRC patients who live in areas with worse socioeconomic conditions have decreased survival than those who live under more affluent conditions; however, the mechanisms by which these area-level factors exert their influence on CRC survival remain unclear.  This amended application of the proposed population-based, prospective study has three specific aims. Aim 1) Determine the extent of the geographic variation of CRC survival across the United States based on small geographic areas at the sub-county (census-tract) level using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data for over 100,000 men and women aged 66 or older diagnosed with CRC. Aim 2) Determine the extent to which lower CRC survival can be explained by higher area socioeconomic deprivation among persons age 66 and older. Aim 3) Identify potential mediating pathways by which higher area socioeconomic deprivation is associated with lower CRC survival among persons age 66 and older, namely a) patient characteristics, b) physician and hospital characteristics, c) tumor characteristics, d) type of treatment received, and e) surveillance for CRC after diagnosis to detect recurrence and metastases.  A multilevel spatial model will be developed to address the specific aims of the proposed study. We will use the following existing data sources: 1) 1992-2005 data from NCI's SEER program (survival, patient characteristics, type of treatment, tumor characteristics); 2) 1991-2005 Medicare data (patient characteristics, type of treatment, surveillance after diagnosis) which is linked to the SEER data; 3) 1991-2005 data from the Provider of Services File (hospital and physician characteristics), 4) 1990-2005 census data (area deprivation measures), and 5) Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data. Advanced Bayesian spatial analyses of CRC survival will be performed and a geographic information system will be used to display the results. Our study will increase understanding of and identify important mechanisms of the role of area-level socioeconomic deprivation on CRC survival. In addition, this study will help provide opportunities for targeting specific geographic areas to allocate resources and interventions locally to improve CRC survival using evidence- based approaches, thereby reducing health disparities associated with living in socioeconomically deprived areas.  Narrative Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths. To reduce geographic disparities in survival following colorectal cancer and to develop and implement interventions that can be targeted locally, it is imperative to identify reasons for lower-than-expected survival.",Geographic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Survival,8617810,R01CA137750,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Behavior ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sound ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program ', ' SEER-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ', ' SEER Program (National Cancer Institute (U.S.)) ', ' SEER Program ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' stressor ', ' social ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' deprivation ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Age-Years ', ' NCCN ', ' National Comprehensive Cancer Network ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Study Section ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Older Population ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' beneficiary ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' aged ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' tumor ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' ']",NCI,SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,296458,0.2390023016330764
"Tailored Touchscreen Colorectal Cancer Prevention in American Indian Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality disproportionately impacts minorities.  Few studies have addressed screening among specific minority populations such as American Indians (AI).  This study will assess the efficacy of a novel tailored touch screen computer intervention based on an innovative integration of the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) and the concept of ""implementation intentions,"" a recent elaboration of the Theory of Planned Behavior.  The majority of the intervention will be delivered in tribal clinics and primary care settings on low-cost touch screen computers through multimedia audio-narrative and video messages.  Studies have not tested the effectiveness of culturally tailored communications specified to stated ""implementation intentions"" for improving CRC screening in this group.  A randomized design will test a comparison condition of generic information versus a  multimedia tailored intervention that specifically addresses each participant's screening test modality  preference, current CRC screening decisional stage (PAPM), and CRC screening ""implementation  intentions"" (the ""when"", ""where"" and ""how"" details of screening).  Behavioral intervention materials will be developed with the help of cultural experts, a pilot test, and from data gathered in a prior focus group study we used to assess key influences on CRC screening for AIs.  The study will be conducted with 460 AI patients eligible for CRC screening and recruited while presenting for care in tribal or regional safety-net clinics.  All participants will receive a baseline touch screen administered assessment and, depending on stated preference, be offered either an immunochemical fecal occult blood test (iFOBT-InSure TM) or colonoscopy.  Participants will be randomized to either C (comparison group-computer  delivered generic CRC information) or AI2 (active intervention-computer delivered culturally tailored  messaging based on individual PAPM stage, behavior constructs, and ""Implementation Intentions"").  A brief office exit survey will assess patient-provider discussions of CRC screening and satisfaction with computerized message materials.           Colorectal Cancer is a major cause of cancer mortality and late stage presentation is common among minorities.

"Variations in Needs after Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Survivorship after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer, the third most common cancer in men and women, has many challenges. Research has shown that colorectal cancer survivors have unmet needs and worse physical and mental quality of life compared to individuals without cancer. Medically underserved populations are known risk groups for poor survivorship care, poor quality of survival, and poor quality of life after colorecal cancer. Sexual minority populations are medically underserved, according to a recent Institute of Medicine Report, yet at present their survivorship care and their quality of life after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer is unknown. The proposed study will determine whether disparities linked to sexual orientation exist in colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life. We will obtain a population-based sample of colorectal cancer survivors who differ by sexual orientation, applying our previously tested recruitment method, which uses cancer registry data from geographic areas with an above average density of sexual minority individuals. After collecting survey data on health care and quality of life, from heterosexual and sexual minority survivors, we will test three study hypotheses: 1) Sexual minority survivors will have poorer quality health care compared to heterosexual survivors, even after controlling for disease and non-disease factors. 2) Heterosexual survivors' quality of life will be better than sexual minority survivors' quality of life, even after controlling for disease and non-disease factors and quality health care. And 3) Sexual minority survivors who are at ease with their sexual minority identity will have better quality health care and quality of life than sexual minorty survivors who have difficulty with their identity. This study will be the first to comprehensively examine sexual minority colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life, illuminating the mechanisms that influence health care and quality of life. The findings will consist of modifiable and non-modifiable factors associated with sexual minority and heterosexual colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life. Researchers, health care providers, and policy makers can then intervene to address the modifiable factors identified by this study to facilitate improvement in diverse colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life. Thi research is critically needed to realize the Institute of Medicine's goals of improving survivorshi in this special population.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this study will provide information about the quality health care and the quality of life of colorectal cancers survivors of different sexual orientations. From the individual interviews with lesbian, gay, and bisexual survivors of colorectal cancer, we will derive salient factors to be included in our survey questionnaire. Using quantitative survey data obtained from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual survivors of colorectal cancers, who were recruited from three cancer registries, we will determine whether there are disparities by sexual orientation in colorectal cancer survivor's quality health care and quality of life. Ultimately, this population-based approach to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual colorectal cancer survivorship is a necessary step on which we expect to build with follow-up research that will use the findings of this study for the development and testing of interventions to improve the needs of lesbian, gay, and bisexual colorectal cancer survivors.                 ",Variations in Needs after Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis,8756147,R01CA181392,"['Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Buffers ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Elements ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Perception ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' Reporting ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' Sampling ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved population ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' metastatic colorectal ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' medically underserved ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia  ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2014,309536,0.06789680106115636
"MODELING SPATIAL ACCESSIBILITY TO LOWER ENDOSCOPY SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Lower endoscopic examinations including flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy have been demonstrated to reduce the risks of incident CRC and CRC-specific mortality through detection and removal of precancerous lesions and early detection of CRC. However, lower endoscopy utilization is still less than 60% among persons aged 50 years or older.  Previous research identified significant geographic variations in CRC screening, incidence, and survival. Small-area socioeconomic deprivation has been associated with CRC-related outcomes, but was unable to explain the observed geographic disparity in CRC-related outcomes, suggesting that other community-level characteristics contribute to geographic disparities in CRC-related outcomes. Access to healthcare is an important prerequisite to obtaining quality care and thus a determinant of health outcomes. Low spatial accessibility to mammography service has been associated with an increased risk of late-stage breast cancer. Little is known whether spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services contributes to the geographic variation in CRC-related outcomes. Therefore, we will explore the hypothesis that geographic disparities in CRC screening, incidence and survival are attributable to spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services. Two specific aims will be addressed: (1) Compute and map small-area spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services across the United States including 50 states and Washington DC, using a GIS, Medicare data, and spatial statistical modeling, and (2) Examine the effects of small-area spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services on CRC-related outcomes, including the risks of incident CRC, advanced stage at diagnosis, and CRC-specific mortality.  We will use three different spatial approaches to quantify and map small-area spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services based on the locations of physicians who performed a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy using Medicare data. Then, we will link the small-area spatial accessibility measures with data from the high- quality NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study including 566,407 persons to prospectively assess the effects of spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services on CRC incidence, advanced stage at diagnosis and CRC- specific mortality. This is the first study to examine the geographic disparity in spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services and prospectively evaluate its effect on CRC outcomes. The results of the proposed study will provide evidence for the development and implementation of evidence-based multilevel interventions to increase lower endoscopy use and thus improve CRC-related outcomes. In addition, the proposed study will develop a spatial accessibility map which will help local and state policy makers improve the allocation of lower endoscopy services.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths while lower endoscopy examinations are effective approaches for CRC prevention and control. To improve the accessibility equity in lower endoscopy services, it is essential to accurately measure the spatial accessibility to lower endoscopy services and to determine the extent to which it impacts on CRC incidence and mortality.

"Race, pathomolecular signature and colorectal cancer survival  ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd most common malignancy in the US and the third leading cause of cancer death. Compared to European Americans (EAs), African Americans (AAs) have a substantially higher CRC mortality rate that is a function of both a higher incidence rate and lower survival rate. Racial disparities in survival persist even after controlling for stage at diagnosis. The reasons for this are not known, but possible explanations include racial differences in aggressiveness of the tumors, socioeconomic variables, and or treatment-related factors. The training and research plan proposed in this K07 career development award will enable me to transition to the next phase of my academic career as an independent investigator in molecular and genetic cancer epidemiology. The training plan consists of several complementary activities including: (1) didactic training (formal coursework/workshops), (2) wet-laboratory experience, (3) attendance at national conferences and seminars (4) mentored clinical research and training in the responsible conduct of research. The primary goal of the research plan is to investigate the role of race, pathologic and molecular prognostic indicators and CRC survival. The research plan is carried out in two studies. In Aim one, a clinic-based study, we will perform a cross-sectional analysis to provide a comprehensive and accurate summary of the pathologic, molecular, and pathomolecular features of primary and metastatic tumors in AAs and EAs with CRC. Specifically, we will estimate the proportion of poor pathologic (e.g. histologic type, colonic location, grade) and molecular (e.g. KRAS, BRAF, p53, CIMP, MSI) prognostic indicators in AAs compared to EAs. In Aim 2, building on Aim 1, we will perform a survival analysis in a cohort of CRC patients to examine the joint influence of race and pathologic and molecular prognostic indicators on survival. Specifically, we will test the hypotheses that after adjustment for confounding variables, (a) younger (<50 years old) AAs compared to EAs will have a higher proportion of poor pathomolecular prognostic indicators and worse survival and (b) older (e 50 years old) AAs compared to EAs will have similar proportions of poor pathomolecular prognostic indicators and similar survival. The combination of the candidate's commitment to understanding the etiology of the racial disparity in colorectal neoplasia, the excellence and expertise of her mentoring team and the strong institutional commitment of the Medical University of South Carolina (a designated National Cancer Center) to reduce the racial disparities in cancer will help the applicant become an independent researcher. The research findings from the present proposal will culminate in a submission of an R01 in year 4 of the award. Ultimately, my goal is draw on the techniques in molecular and genetic epidemiology to reduce the disparities in incidence and survival between AAs and EAs in South Carolina and beyond.  Public Health Relevancy Statement Colorectal cancer is the source of significant morbidity and mortality especially among African Americans. Studies, like the one proposed, seek to understand the etiology of the racial disparities in colorectal cancer and hence provide insights into the mechanisms of the disease process. We envision the present proposal as part of the larger question of exploring, understanding, and improving outcomes among AA diagnosed with colorectal cancer.","Race, pathomolecular signature and colorectal cancer survival",8707398,K07CA151864,"['Age ', ' Age Factors ', ' Award ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' large bowel neoplasm ', ' colorectal neoplasia ', ' Large Intestine Tumor ', ' Large Intestine Neoplasm ', ' Large Bowel Tumor ', ' Colorectal Tumors ', ' Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' neoplasia ', ' Neoplasms ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Medical ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Staging ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Reporting ', ' v-raf Murine Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog B1 ', ' RAFB1 ', ' BRAF ', ' B-raf-1 ', ' BRAF gene ', ' response ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' v-Ki-RAS2 Kirsten Rat Sarcoma 2 Viral Oncogene Homolog ', ' RASK2 ', ' Oncogene K-Ras ', ' Ki-RAS ', ' KRAS2 ', ' KRAS ', ' K-Ras-2 Oncogene ', ' K-Ras 2A ', ' K-RAS2B ', ' K-RAS2A ', ' C-K-RAS ', ' KRAS2 gene ', ' Address ', ' CIMP ', ' CpG Island Methylator Phenotype ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' medically underserved ', ' tumor ', ' treatment response ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' ']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K07,2014,129249,0.08603826631732904
"Adding Hispanics to Ongoing GWAS in Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been instrumental in identifying a number of common susceptibility loci in Non Hispanic (NH)-White populations and a NCI priority is to extend GWAS findings to other populations to address racial/ethnic disparities in cancer susceptibility. Currently, GWA studies of CRC in NH-Whites, Japanese and African-Americans are ongoing. We propose a complementary study to address this critical research area in Hispanics. Hispanics represent the fastest growing ethnic population in the U.S. and have been largely understudied in terms of genetic susceptibility to cancer. There are noted differences in incidence, survival and mortality in CRC by ethnic/racial groups. Hispanics often present with CRC at a younger age and have a significantly greater incidence of stage IV tumors or metastatic disease compared to NH-Whites. We propose to conduct a large, cost-efficient, population-based GWAS in Hispanics by building upon existing NIH-funded resources, the Colon Cancer Family Registry (Colon CFR) and the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC). We plan to recruit 2,500 Hispanic men and women diagnosed with CRC between 01/2010 to 10/2013 using cancer registries in California. Risk factor/diet questionnaires, pathology reports, Oragene buccal samples (for genotyping) and tumor blocks (for MSI testing) will be collected using methodologies developed in the Colon CFR/MEC. Cases of CRC in the MEC (currently 473; anticipated 600 at end) will also be included. Population-based Hispanic individuals without a diagnosis of CRC participating in other GWA studies in the MEC (n=3,900, U01HG004726, Haiman) will be used as controls. We will genotype all 3,100 cases using the Illumina 1M array and use available genotype and epidemiologic data collected on 3,900 controls. Our statistical analyses will include: single-SNP and haplotype effects, gene-environment interactions and heterogeneity by MSI, tumor subtype and family history of CRC. We will replicate findings in a second-stage using CRC cases and controls from Mexico (1,000 cases and 1,000 controls, EU FP7 funding, CHIBCHA, Carvajal-Carmona/Tomlinson). We will also examine heterogeneity of the risk estimates by ethnicity/race by leveraging GWA data on NH-Whites (2,142 cases, 1,909 controls, U01 CA122839, Casey), (4,000 cases, 6,000 NH-White controls, UK-CHIBCHA, Tomlinson), Colombians (2,000 cases and 2,000 controls, CHIBCHA), Japanese (1,000 cases and 1,000 controls) and African-Americans (1,500 cases and 1,500 controls, R01CA126895, Le Marchand). We will genotype replicated significant SNPs in our main and combined analysis in several Hispanic populations (note: studies funded by EU or NIH for data collection but not GWAS) including: 800 Puerto Ricans, 2,000 Brazilians, 2,000 Argentineans and 3,000 Spanish/Portuguese to assess generalizability of findings. This study will have a high impact by addressing the key question of racial/ethnic disparities related to genetic susceptibility to CRC, and will enable further growth and investment into research among Hispanics by providing a resource of genetic data and biospecimens, which is lacking.        We propose to conduct a large population-based study to understand the role of the human genome in the etiology of colorectal cancer among Hispanics. The Hispanic population is the fastest growing ethnic population in the U.S. We also propose to investigate differences in genetic effects on risk of colorectal cancer across multiple races/ethnicities including Non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, Japanese and African-Americans. This study will address an important gap in genome-wide association studies of colorectal cancer in Hispanics and be able to evaluate differences in cancer susceptibility in different ethnic/racial groups.

"Conjoint analysis to measure physician discrimination toward African Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Research Council defines discrimination as ""differential treatment on the basis of race that disadvantages a racial group."" Decades of research have found that well-intentioned physicians discriminate by providing unequal healthcare recommendations to minorities versus whites. Physicians' discrimination, though often unintentional, can play a significant role in creating and perpetuating disparities. The National Institute of Health (NIH) (PA-11-164) recognizes the critical need to empirically measure racial discrimination in healthcare in order to reduce health disparities. Despite the serious public health repercussions of physicians' discrimination, no gold standard assessment method has yet been developed to measure such discrimination. To date, the assessment methods that have been used to measure physicians' discrimination (e.g., self-report) have serious limitations (e.g., tainted by social desirability effects). Given the limitations in the previously studied assessment methods, PA-11-164 calls for research to ""improve the measurement of racial/ethnic discrimination in healthcare delivery"" in order to move toward eliminating the unequal treatment of minorities in our healthcare system. In direct response to this call for research, the proposed R03 aims to test an innovative assessment method, conjoint analysis, to examine the role of patients' race on physicians' treatment recommendations. Conjoint analysis is an assessment method that asks participants to respond to a series of computer-generated vignettes that vary on multiple factors (e.g., hypothetical patients' race, income, and health status). Conjoint analysis has the unique ability to overcome the limitations in the previously used assessment methods because: 1) it can detect socially undesirability effects (e.g., discrimination); and, 2) it has been found to be an excellent predictor of real worl behavior. For the proposed project, conjoint analysis will be used to detect physicians' discrimination against African Americans in the delivery of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations (i.e., colonoscopy, FOBT, FIT). Physicians' differing CRC screening recommendations can have direct consequences on CRC disparities. Aim 1 is to examine whether conjoint analysis can detect the role of patients' race on physicians' recommendations for CRC screenings. Aim 2 is to explore whether physicians' beliefs about patients' health behaviors (as determined by conjoint analysis) will mediate the relationship between patients' race and physicians' recommendations. Aim 3 is to explore whether physician characteristics (e.g., gender, race) moderate the relationship between patients' race and physicians' CRC screening recommendations. To achieve these aims, we will enroll 732 primary care physicians to participate in the conjoint study. The results of the R03 will contribute to the growing literatre on physicians' discrimination toward African Americans in recommending colorectal cancer screenings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If conjoint analysis proves to be a sound assessment method to detect physicians' discrimination in recommending CRC screenings, there is a strong argument for the widespread use of conjoint analysis to detect physicians' discrimination toward other racial/ethnic minority groups (e.g., Hispanics) and in other healthcare settings. The accurate measurement of physicians' discrimination can serve as an important step toward reducing the unequal treatment of minorities in our healthcare system, by providing the data necessary to develop targeted interventions.                ",Conjoint analysis to measure physician discrimination toward African Americans,8601058,R03CA173421,"['Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Laboratories ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Research Council ', ' National Research Council (U.S.) ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' Social Desirability ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' interest ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' ethnic discrimination ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Minority ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' computer generated ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R03,2014,82208,0.11849143082491372
"Effectiveness of Screening Colonoscopy in Reducing Deaths from Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers of the colon and rectum (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the US, can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques. Although some expert groups in the US consider colonoscopy to be the standard, there is currently only limited direct evidence to support its increasing use for screening in average risk adults. Colonoscopy has higher risks and costs than other screening tests. Recent studies reported that colonoscopy did not reduce mortality from right-sided colon cancers, the part of the colon that is beyond the reach of sigmoidoscopy. However, those findings were controversial because that study was unable to distinguish screening from diagnostic uses or accurately assess the completeness of colonoscopies. This project's goal is to inform clinical and policy decisions by providing evidence to show whether the purported benefits of colonoscopy are realized in practice. The primary specific aim is to estimate the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy in reducing death from CRC among average-risk adults when compared to no screening, overall and separately for right- and left-sided cancers. Our secondary aims are to: 1) determine the impact of the completeness of colonoscopy examinations on its effectiveness; and 2) compare the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy relative to sigmoidoscopy. We will use a case-control design nested in an historical cohort of persons receiving care at 3 sites participating in a research consortium, Cancer Research Network (CRN). These sites provide the full continuum of cancer care to their members ranging from screening through end of life care, and provide access to information on CRC screening that can be linked to diagnosis and cause-specific mortality data on large numbers of racially and socioeconomically diverse persons. We will identify at least 1,200 cases of CRC deaths between 2007 and 2014 among enrollees who were 52 years or older at the date of the diagnosis, each matched within each health plan to two randomly selected controls based on age, sex and enrollment history. We will identify screening history for a minimum of 10 years prior to cancer diagnosis, differentiating screening from diagnostic procedures, using standardized targeted chart reviews and other sources. The sample size will provide sufficient power for separate evaluations of tumors located in the right colon. This project will be carried out by an experienced interdisciplinary team representing epidemiology, case-control methodology, biostatistics, gastroenterology and primary care. Team members are national leaders in CRC screening research and policy. This project is in synergy with existing NCI and the CRN goals to: 1) develop methods and approaches to provide clinical, policy-relevant information; and 2) inform clinical and public health decisions on CRC screening. This application is also responsive to the NCI's priority to improve understanding of the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of tests used in screening for CRC, a ""health disparity condition"", and addresses Healthy People 2010 goals to reduce cancer death.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, but many of these cancers can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques. Although many people believe that colonoscopy is the best screening test, there is currently no scientific evidence to support that claim. The goal of our proposed study is to provide scientific evidence on whether current beliefs about the benefits of colonoscopy screening are realized in actual clinical practice in order to help patients, doctors, and policy makers make decisions about colon cancer screening.

"Culturally Targeted Loss Framed Messaging for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Afri     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary African-Americans are at a substantially increased risk of both developing and dying from colorectal cancer (CRC). This costly disparity can be largely attributed to African-Americans' diminished use of available CRC screenings. Although early detection of CRC via screening is highly beneficial, efforts to encourage their use among African-Americans have not been successful, suggesting a critical need to develop and evaluate effective health messaging strategies. In turn, health communication research has advocated the use of both loss-framed messaging and also personal prevention messaging to encourage illness detection b behaviors. However, the capacity of these messaging strategies to encourage CRC screening among African-Americans is not well understood. This includes limited knowledge about the potential of such messages to interface with perceptions of racism and medical mistrust that can impede screening behavior, and also whether loss-framed and personal prevention messages can be simultaneously employed to better promote CRC screening among African-Americans. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop health communications that reduce significant and costly ethnic health disparities, and to reveal psychological processes that underlie effective health messaging for ethnic minorities. The immediate objective of this application is to identify how gain and loss-framed messaging, as well as personal prevention messaging, may be used to reduce CRC screening disparities among African-Americans. The central hypothesis is that African-Americans will be best compelled to obtain screening for CRC when messages simultaneously emphasize personal prevention and are loss-framed. The specific aims are to 1) identify and compare effects of stand-alone gain versus loss- framed health messaging on African-Americans' CRC screening attitudes, intentions, and behavior; 2) identify and compare effects of gain versus loss-framed health messaging on African-Americans' perceived racism and medical mistrust; 3) determine the effect of coupling gain and loss-framed messages with a culturally-targeted personal prevention message on African-Americans' CRC screening attitudes, intentions, and behavior. The proposed research will develop and administer for unique versions of a CRC informational and screening video communication. These videos will be used to experimentally evaluate the effects of stand-alone and coupled loss-framed and personal prevention health messages on CRC screening attitudes, intentions, and behavior in a local sample of African-Americans. The proposed research will also identify the effects of health messages on perceived racism and medical mistrust. The public health implications of this project are significant. Namely, the proposed research will provide knowledge that is critical for developing and evaluating useful approaches to ethnic minority health messaging, and for better understanding how best to encourage cancer detection behaviors among African-Americans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative The proposed research will evaluate how broad-spectrum and culture-specific health messaging strategies can be combined to better promote colorectal cancer screening among African-Americans.

"Community Based Prevention Marketing for Systems Change: Reducing Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a Prevention Research Center that uses community-based prevention marketing (CBPM) to adapt, implement, evaluate, and disseminate evidence-based approaches to strengthen state and local health departments' and community coalitions' capacity for sustained disease prevention and health promotion. The FPRC's health priority will be the reduction of cancer disparities, and the core research project for the next five years will focus on the promotion of colorectal cancer screening (CRCS). The FPRC's mission and core research are responsive to the Guide to Community Preventive Services' focus on multilevel interventions to increase screening for cancer. The core research project will focus on colorectal cancer (CRC), selected by our State partner - the Florida Department of Health (FDOH), because it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women in the U.S. While scientific cancer advances are occurring, racial ethnic minorities and the medically underserved have consistently experienced the highest CRC mortality rates. The aims of the core research project are to: 1) examine disparities in late stage colorectal cancer incidence and screening rates to identify priority populations; 2) identify appropriate and feasible evidence-based interventions (EBI) for the priority populations; 3) conduct formative research with priority populations and key stakeholders to assess the EBIs' acceptability and to tailor EBIs to better meet priority population(s)' preferences and needs; and 4) implement and evaluate the multilevel intervention and make recommendations for future programs and policies in the state of Florida. This proposal makes three significant contributions to prevention research. First, the FPRC will work with FDOH, a community committee and other stakeholders (e.g., American Cancer Society) to test the CBPM for Systems Change framework's ability to select, tailor, promote, monitor, evaluate, and disseminate EBIs to reduce colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) health disparities. This planning framework has the potential to equip prevention researchers, health department and community partners with an effective planning framework that accelerates the translation of research to practice. Lessons learned from this demonstration project will be used to enhance the FPRC's training website and provide technical assistance to other State health departments and community partners. Second, the FPRC and its partners will create a computer simulation model of the system in which CRCS disparities are embedded and identify evidence-based interventions appropriate for addressing determinants at multiple levels in that system. This model and formative research results will be used to design an integrated, multilevel intervention for reducing CRC disparities. The intervention will be evaluated and the feasibility of scaling it up to other communities assessed. A dissemination plan will be created for effective components. Third, the FPRC will use lessons learned from the new and previous demonstration projects to enhance the CBPM training website and mentor other public health agencies and community partners that adopt it.                  Project Narrative The Florida Prevention Research Center (FPRC) uses community-based prevention marketing (CBPM) for systems change to develop, adapt, implement, evaluate, and disseminate evidence-based approaches to strengthen state and local health departments' and community coalitions' capacity for sustained disease prevention and health promotion.

"Genetic Association Studies in African American Colorectal Cancer Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant cause of cancer morbidity and mortality affecting almost 150,000 Americans yearly. African Americans have the highest CRC incidence and mortality of all US populations. These disparities have not been explained, and biological risk factors including genetic susceptibility to CRC are understudied in African Americans. I am a gastroenterologist who seeks to develop a career as an independent translational physician-scientist in CRC genetics. My long-term career goals require me to obtain additional training in: 1) molecular and statistical genetics; and 2) cancer biology. The 5-year career development program described in this application will take place at the University of Chicago which distinguishes itself in the field of human and cancer genetics especially in admixed populations. I am fortunate to have key collaborators at the University of North Carolina and the University of Illinois Chicago, and together we have DNA from over 1000 African American CRC patients and 1000 African American control subjects available for my proposed study. Dr. Nancy Cox, Professor of Medicine and Chief of Human Genetics, is my mentor and will provide expertise in statistical genetics. Dr. Nathan Ellis, Associate Professor of Medicine, is a co-mentor and will provide expertise in CRC molecular genetics. An inter-disciplinary Advisory Committee comprised of Dr. Rick Kittles, an expert in genetics of admixed populations, Dr. Olufunmilayo Olopade, an internationally recognized leader in cancer genetics, and Dr. Eugene Chang, a successful physician-scientist in gastroenterology, will guide and advise me during this development period. The broad objectives of this research proposal are the identification of genetic susceptibility factors that contribute to risk of CRC development in African Americans. I will study single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered using genome-wide association studies in European populations. Regions containing these SNP are likely to harbor functional variants. African Americans are an ideal population in whom to identify functional variants because their genomes exhibit less linkage disequilibrium. To this end, I propose three specific aims: 1) Validate candidate CRC-associated regions in African American cases and controls; 2) Discover novel SNPs in CRC-associated regions by targeted resequencing using next-generation sequencing technologies; and 3) Identify putative functional variants in candidate CRC-associated regions that can be further evaluated in future functional studies. By the end of my career development period, I will be uniquely equipped to undertake further translational research in CRC genetics. My long-term research goals are to understand genetic susceptibility in CRC pathogenesis and to study how genetic susceptibility factors can be used to risk stratify individuals for CRC screening and thereby prevent disease especially in high risk but understudied populations like African Americans.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of all US populations, African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer. Reasons for these differences are not explained, and hereditary factors have not been extensively studied in this high risk population. The goal of our study is to better understand hereditary factors that increase risk of colorectal cancer especially in African-Americans.

"Racial Disparity in Colorectal Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now well recognized that African Americans (AAs) exhibit disproportionately higher incidence and mortality rates for colorectal cancer (CRC) than European Americans/Caucasians (CAs). Also, black women are more likely to die from CRC than women in any other racial group and black men are even more likely to die from CRC than black women (Ginsburg CH, Clin Gastroentrol Hepatol 9: 859-61, 2011). Despite this grim outlook, little is known about the molecular and biochemical mechanisms for the racial disparity in CRC. Our ongoing mutation analysis of Apc and b-catenin genes revealed higher incidence of mutation of both Apc and b-catenin in colonic biopsies from AAs than CAs. Since cancer stem/stem-like cells (CSCs/CSLCs) are thought to be critically involved in the development and progression of many malignancies, including CRC, we also investigated whether the difference in CRC between AAs and CAs could partly be attributed to changes in CSCs/CSLCs. We observed that colon CSCs/CSLCs, specifically the proportion of CD44+CD166- phenotype, was markedly higher in colonic effluent, collected during colonoscopy, of AAs with adenomas than their CA counterparts. This increase was accompanied by a concomitant rise colonic mucosal microRNA-21 (miR-21), which has been shown to regulate CSCs/CSLCs. We hypothesize that the high incidence of CRC in AAs could be due to an increase in CSCs/CSLCs in the colon, in particular those with CD44+CD166- phenotype that exhibit increased mutation of tumor suppressor and/or proto-oncogenes, specifically Apc, k-ras and/or b- catenin. We will test this hypothesis by examining the mutational status of Apc, K-ras and/or b-catenin in CD44+CD166- CSCs/CSLCs, isolated from colonic biopsies and colonic effluent of AAs and CAs subjects with and without adenomas (Specific Aim 1). We also hypothesize that microRNA-21 (miR-21) plays a critical role in regulating colon CSCs/CSLCs. We will test this hypothesis (a) by examining the levels of miR-21 in CSCs/CSLCs, specifically in CD44+CD166- phenotype isolated from the normal appearing mucosa and colonic effluent of AAs and CAs with and without adenomas and also (b) by carrying out in vitro studies to examine the extent of changes in the proportion of CD44+CD166- phenotype following downregulation of miR- 21 (Specific Aim 2). Lastly, we will examine whether overall CSCs/CSLCs as well as CD44+CD166- phenotype isolated from normal appearing mucosa and colonic effluent of AAs with adenomatous polyps will possess greater tumorigenic properties in vitro and in vivo in SCID mice, compared to those from CAs (Specific Aim 3). The proposed study would not only give us a better understanding of the biological basis for the higher prevalence of CRC among AAs but would also lead to a new stratification strategy that would allow a better targeting of limited resources into screening of patients at the highest risk more intensely than those at lower risk.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although African Americans (AAs) have higher incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) and greater mortality from this disease than Caucasian Americans (CAs), little is known about the molecular mechanisms for the racial disparity in CRC. The proposed investigation is aimed at testing the hypothesis that the high incidence of CRC in AAs is due to an increase in self- renewing cancer stem or stem-like cells in the colon that exhibit increased mutations of genes, responsible for the development and progression of CRC and an increase in microRNA-21 that regulates cancer stem/stem-like cells. The proposed study would not only give us a better understanding of the biological basis for the higher prevalence of CRC among AAs, but could allow a better targeting of limited resources into screening of patients at the highest risk more intensely than those at lower risk.            ",Racial Disparity in Colorectal Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms,8644260,R21CA175916,"['adenoma ', ' Age ', ' Biopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Cells ', ' Colon ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genes ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mucosal Tissue ', ' Mucosa ', ' Mucous Membrane ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' protooncogene ', ' c-ONC ', ' Cellular Oncogene ', ' Proto-Oncogenes ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' regenerate ', ' Regeneration ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' severe combined immune deficiency ', ' Severe Combined Immunodeficient Mice ', ' SCID Mice ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' polypoid adenoma ', ' Adenomatous Polyps ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' European ', ' Gastroenterologist ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Pathologist ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' tumor suppressor ', ' Tumor Suppressor Proteins ', ' cohort ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Reporting ', ' Mutation Analysis ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' MEMD ', ' CD166 ', ' ALCAM ', ' ALCAM gene ', ' Pgp1 ', ' MDU3 ', ' CD44 ', ' CD44 gene ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Stratification ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' tumorigenic ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' self-renew ', ' self-renewal ', ' stemness ', ' stem ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,132915,0.11100351538235427
"Easy, Affordable and Accurate Point of Care Screening to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer death in the US causing more than 50,000 deaths each year. Unfortunately, African Americans (AAs) experience disproportionate incidence and mortality rates of CRC across all races in the US due to a complex interplay of economic, social, and cultural factors. AA's higher incidence, lower rates of screening and later stage of diagnosis make them 1.5 times more likely to die of CRC than their White counterparts. To improve screening participation, enable early detection and reduce the disparities in CRC mortality, Beacon Biomedical aims to provide community physicians with an easy, affordable (<$50) and accurate point-of-care assay as an alternative for their AA patients who routinely avoid colonoscopies or fecal testing. From a single drop of blood, this assay will allow them too rapidly (<10 min) identify which of these screening non-compliant patients have a higher likelihood of having undiagnosed colorectal neoplasia (CRC sensitivity>90%, specificity>90%) while they are still in their offices. With real time discussions of results and the need for follow-up care, positive test results can provide a powerful motivation for patients to see their gastroenterologist despite thei historical reluctance to do so. To accomplish this aim, Beacon Biomedical has entered into a public-private partnership with NCI- Frederick's Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and Howard University to translate CCR's basic research on Cripto-1 (CR-1) into a point of care CRC screening device. In this SBIR, work begins by verifying the technical, clinical and cultural feasibility of achieving this critical goal. Technically, the work centers on replicating a publishd study (Bianco, 2006) that demonstrated CR-1's significant upregulation in white colorectal cancer patients (mean 4.68 ng/ml) versus controls (mean 0.32 ng/ml) using a first of its kind competitive ELISA assay that quantifies total Cr-1 (bound and free) and later using a dot blot assay that severs as a POC prototype. Clinically, work includes expanding upon the 2006 results in a study of 100 plasma samples.

"CRC Screening Thoughts and Feelings: Increasing Engagement of African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality of any ethnic/racial group. While screening, and particularly colonoscopy, is effective in reducing the incidence of CRC, adherence is low. In fact, a newly released modeling study suggests that disparities in screening accounts for over 40 percent of incidence disparities and almost 20 percent of mortality disparities. This is particularly true for African Americans; further, they are less likely to receive influential physician referrals for screening. There is a critical need to improve our understanding of adherence and the factors which influence African Americans' decisions about engaging in CRC screening, as well as efficacious intervention strategies. Behavioral research has shown links to cognitive decision-making factors (perceived benefits and barriers) and affective decision-making factors (fear and worry) in predicting CRC screening and intentions to screen. However, little or no work has systematically examined these factors in African Americans; this creates significant gaps in knowledge about the role of these factors in predicting (and potentially increasing) CRC screening for minorities. The goal of the proposed application is to understand factors influencing the decisions of African Americans to engage in (or not engage in) screening for CRC and the ability to positively impact these factors through intervention strategies at a community level. The central hypotheses are: a) that decisions to engage in CRC screening will be a function of both cognitive and affective factors; and b) that educational interventions can effectively alter both affective and cognitive factors and therefore increase CRC screening rates for African Americans. The Specific Aims proposed to test our hypotheses are: Aim 1: Examine the impact of two randomized community interventions on cognitive and affective factors and their resulting influence on health care seeking and CRC screening behaviors for African Americans. Aim 2: Examine and explore contextual factors that may influence the process of behavior change to better understand CRC screening and health care seeking behaviors at the community level. This study will significantly increase our understanding of factors which influence African Americans' decisions about health care seeking and CRC screening behavior and whether a community-based intervention can positively impact these factors and behaviors to reduce disparities. Expected outcomes: the work proposed in these aims will provide crucial information about behavioral change specific to health care seeking and CRC screening by African Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is relevant to public health because it studies the factors which influence African Americans' decisions about engaging in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and the potential effectiveness of community-based outreach interventions to impact these decisions for African Americans who have an excess incidence and mortality rate from this disease. The proposed study is relevant to the NIH mission pertaining to support of knowledge and research that will help reduce colorectal cancer health disparities.",CRC Screening Thoughts and Feelings: Increasing Engagement of African Americans,9040390,R01CA171935,"['Accounting ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' Health Care Seeking Behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Influentials ', ' Mission ', ' Study models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' behavior change ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Church ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' care seeking ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Age-Years ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Behavioral ', ' community intervention ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Affective ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' effective intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' public health priorities ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R01,2015,172890,0.30223501520001494
"Easy, Affordable and Accurate Point of Care Screening to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer death in the US causing more than 50,000 deaths each year. Unfortunately, African Americans (AAs) experience disproportionate incidence and mortality rates of CRC across all races in the US due to a complex interplay of economic, social, and cultural factors. AA's higher incidence, lower rates of screening and later stage of diagnosis make them 1.5 times more likely to die of CRC than their White counterparts. To improve screening participation, enable early detection and reduce the disparities in CRC mortality, Beacon Biomedical aims to provide community physicians with an easy, affordable (<$50) and accurate point-of-care assay as an alternative for their AA patients who routinely avoid colonoscopies or fecal testing. From a single drop of blood, this assay will allow them too rapidly (<10 min) identify which of these screening non-compliant patients have a higher likelihood of having undiagnosed colorectal neoplasia (CRC sensitivity>90%, specificity>90%) while they are still in their offices. With real time discussions of results and the need for follow-up care, positive test results can provide a powerful motivation for patients to see their gastroenterologist despite thei historical reluctance to do so. To accomplish this aim, Beacon Biomedical has entered into a public-private partnership with NCI- Frederick's Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and Howard University to translate CCR's basic research on Cripto-1 (CR-1) into a point of care CRC screening device. In this SBIR, work begins by verifying the technical, clinical and cultural feasibility of achieving this critical goal. Technically, the work centers on replicating a publishd study (Bianco, 2006) that demonstrated CR-1's significant upregulation in white colorectal cancer patients (mean 4.68 ng/ml) versus controls (mean 0.32 ng/ml) using a first of its kind competitive ELISA assay that quantifies total Cr-1 (bound and free) and later using a dot blot assay that severs as a POC prototype. Clinically, work includes expanding upon the 2006 results in a study of 100 plasma samples. To ensure the assay works on the intended use population, samples will be split evenly between cases and controls; male and female; AA and White, in the first study to ever examine CR-1 levels in an African American cohort or in subjects with advanced adenomas. Culturally, patient preference survey will be conducted to ensure that there is a high ""intent to comply"" if a simple POC assay were available to AA's who avoid colonoscopies or fecal testing.

"Adding Hispanics to Ongoing GWAS in Colorectal Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been instrumental in identifying a number of common susceptibility loci in Non Hispanic (NH)-White populations and a NCI priority is to extend GWAS findings to other populations to address racial/ethnic disparities in cancer susceptibility. Currently, GWA studies of CRC in NH-Whites, Japanese and African-Americans are ongoing. We propose a complementary study to address this critical research area in Hispanics. Hispanics represent the fastest growing ethnic population in the U.S. and have been largely understudied in terms of genetic susceptibility to cancer. There are noted differences in incidence, survival and mortality in CRC by ethnic/racial groups. Hispanics often present with CRC at a younger age and have a significantly greater incidence of stage IV tumors or metastatic disease compared to NH-Whites. We propose to conduct a large, cost-efficient, population-based GWAS in Hispanics by building upon existing NIH-funded resources, the Colon Cancer Family Registry (Colon CFR) and the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC). We plan to recruit 2,500 Hispanic men and women diagnosed with CRC between 01/2010 to 10/2013 using cancer registries in California. Risk factor/diet questionnaires, pathology reports, Oragene buccal samples (for genotyping) and tumor blocks (for MSI testing) will be collected using methodologies developed in the Colon CFR/MEC. Cases of CRC in the MEC (currently 473; anticipated 600 at end) will also be included. Population-based Hispanic individuals without a diagnosis of CRC participating in other GWA studies in the MEC (n=3,900, U01HG004726, Haiman) will be used as controls. We will genotype all 3,100 cases using the Illumina 1M array and use available genotype and epidemiologic data collected on 3,900 controls. Our statistical analyses will include: single-SNP and haplotype effects, gene-environment interactions and heterogeneity by MSI, tumor subtype and family history of CRC. We will replicate findings in a second-stage using CRC cases and controls from Mexico (1,000 cases and 1,000 controls, EU FP7 funding, CHIBCHA, Carvajal-Carmona/Tomlinson). We will also examine heterogeneity of the risk estimates by ethnicity/race by leveraging GWA data on NH-Whites (2,142 cases, 1,909 controls, U01 CA122839, Casey), (4,000 cases, 6,000 NH-White controls, UK-CHIBCHA, Tomlinson), Colombians (2,000 cases and 2,000 controls, CHIBCHA), Japanese (1,000 cases and 1,000 controls) and African-Americans (1,500 cases and 1,500 controls, R01CA126895, Le Marchand). We will genotype replicated significant SNPs in our main and combined analysis in several Hispanic populations (note: studies funded by EU or NIH for data collection but not GWAS) including: 800 Puerto Ricans, 2,000 Brazilians, 2,000 Argentineans and 3,000 Spanish/Portuguese to assess generalizability of findings. This study will have a high impact by addressing the key question of racial/ethnic disparities related to genetic susceptibility to CRC, and will enable further growth and investment into research among Hispanics by providing a resource of genetic data and biospecimens, which is lacking. We propose to conduct a large population-based study to understand the role of the human genome in the etiology of colorectal cancer among Hispanics. The Hispanic population is the fastest growing ethnic population in the U.S. We also propose to investigate differences in genetic effects on risk of colorectal cancer across multiple races/ethnicities including Non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, Japanese and African-Americans. This study will address an important gap in genome-wide association studies of colorectal cancer in Hispanics and be able to evaluate differences in cancer susceptibility in different ethnic/racial groups.",Adding Hispanics to Ongoing GWAS in Colorectal Cancer,8856513,R01CA155101,"['Age ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Japanese ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexico ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family history of ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Genetic ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Staging ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Country ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' novel ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' Pathology Report ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Microsatellite Instability ', ' genetic resource ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' attributable fraction ', ' Population Attributable Risks ', ' 8q24 ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Tumor Subtype ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' early onset ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' tumor ', ' population based ', ' colon cancer family registry ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2015,565136,0.22829246923831334
"The Impact of a Targeted CRC Screening Intervention among Latinos in Central PA DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely recognized that colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most preventable cancers. If adenomatous polyps detected by screening were removed before they transformed into cancers, a decrease in new CRCs and in related mortality would follow. Unfortunately, cancer screening rates are low throughout Appalachia, including for Latino residents in PA. Further, Latinos are more likely to be diagnosed at later stage than Whites, have a lower survival rate and less access to quality treatment. Our long-term goal is to increase CRC screening uptake among Latinos in urban and rural central Pennsylvania (PA). Our central hypothesis is that a targeted CRC screening intervention can increase uptake over a non-targeted approach for this population. The specific objectives of the current proposal are to develop, implement and evaluate a targeted CRC screening intervention to increase CRC screening uptake. We will measure actual CRC uptake in both the control and intervention arm as a method to determinate completion rates. To prepare for my K01 application during my post-doc training, I led the design, implementation, and analysis of a CRC-related Latino study that provided preliminary data for theK01 work. In 04/09, utilizing the ACCN coalitions in PA, I conducted eight focus groups (FG) to identify barriers to CRC screenings among Latinos. We identified several substantial barriers to CRC screening for this population, including a significant barrier heretofore unmentioned in literature related to CRC screenings. Spanish-speaking patients want to have family members or close friends in the doctor office and health-related education classes. This barrier was reported across all groups and likely links to the desire for a strong social support that influences their CRC screening behavior. Another finding is that urban residents had some prior knowledge of risk factors associated with CRC screening while rural residents reported no prior knowledge and were unable to list any associated CRC risk factor. A high acceptability of the provider-recommended take-home fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for these Latinos was also reported. We exceeded our study recruitment goal. The same partnered Latino leaders are committed to the K01 proposed work. The K01 study design is a randomized, community-based, participatory design to determine completion of a provider-recommended, take-home FIT kit without (control) and with social support (intervention) among a sample of average-risk, urban and rural Appalachian Latino adults age 50 and older not currently adherent to national CRC screening guidelines (N=264).Each consented participant will attend a one-time, community- based CRC screening educational program offered at one of the eight study sites located in Central PA. The proposal is innovative because it combines provider-recommended FIT screening test with an education program and social support for Latinos in a randomized, community-based participatory research design. Further, it will provide preliminary data for evidence-based methods to increase CRC screening rates among Latinos throughout Appalachia, the focus of a future NIH NC1 R-series grant application. In an effort to reduce this ethnic disparity among Latinos, screening rates among this population must increase. The specific objectives of the current proposal are to develop, implement and evaluate a multi-component targeted colorectal cancer (CRC) screening intervention to increase CRC screening uptake. The research will provide preliminary data for evidence-based methods to increase CRC screening rates among Latinos; and a future NIH NC1 R-series grant application.",The Impact of a Targeted CRC Screening Intervention among Latinos in Central PA,8915627,K01CA151752,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Belief ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Family member ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' polypoid adenoma ', ' Adenomatous Polyps ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Staging ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' post intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' eligible participant ', ' community based participatory research ', ' evidence base ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K01,2015,41584,0.22340591879294888
"Promoting Colorectal Cancer Screening in Rural Emergency Departments DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural Appalachian Kentuckians suffer a disproportionate incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer death. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that as many as 60 percent of CRC related deaths could be prevented if everyone age 50 and older were screened regularly. Rural Appalachian residents are currently being screened at suboptimal rates. The proposed intervention builds on our successful cancer prevention projects: Faith Moves Mountains: A CBPR Appalachian Wellness and Cancer Prevention Program and Promoting Mammography among African American Women Visiting the Emergency Departments. Both projects involve lay health advisor (LHA) delivered motivational interviewing interventions that have been culturally tailored. We propose to pilot test a culturally tailored intervention using brief motivational interviewing by LHAs to promote CRC screenings in an emergency department (ED) serving rural Appalachian Kentucky in order to (1) evaluate the feasibility of the intervention in this rurl Appalachian setting; and (2) assess the effects of the intervention on perceived barriers to CRC screening and subsequent cancer screening engagement.  Consistent with our current Faith Moves Mountains and Promoting Mammography projects, we will train carefully selected community members (LHAs) to deliver a brief motivational interview while participants wait for non-urgent care in the ED or wait with a family member who is receiving care. Each participant, in conjunction with the LHA, will develop a written plan of action that addresses their identified barriers to screening. The brief intervention will take about 15 minutes and will be delivered in a private area of the ED. Control group participants will receive standard-of-care ED services that include brochure information identifying general cancer screening services provided by the hospital.

"Communicating Colorectal Cancer Prevention thru Urban African American Churches  Project Summary/Abstract African Americans, one of the largest minorities in the country fare worse in colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality when compared to several other races and often have negative perceptions to screening (Greiner, et al. 2005). Research indicates religion and spirituality as components that should be considered when appealing to individuals about health and making health decisions (Egbert, Mickley, Coeling, 2004). African Americans in particular are highly religious and also regularly attend church services more than any group in the country (Pew, 2007). The goals then of the proposed 5-year study are to obtain crucial preliminary data beyond the Minority Supplement that show the African American church as an important vehicle of cancer communication among African Americans. The central hypothesis of this overall research plan is that church-sponsored messages will have greater impact on cancer screening behavior outcome and will be more appealing to African Americans than traditional cancer- sponsored screening messages. The proposed research is innovative because it capitalizes on the church and prevalent social and cultural norms to socially market the product of CRC screening to promote healthy behavior among African Americans. The trust and social cohesion within the church will promote health messages to motivate or persuade individuals to perform cancer screening. The outcomes of this research will be novel information about how religion and church-sponsored materials relate to perceptions and attitudes; and how religion and the church in CRC cancer screening messages impact screening behavior among African Americans. The findings and results of the proposed interdisciplinary research will benefit African Americans' health because the outcomes will lead to improve health campaigns and communications to targeted populations at risk for cancer disparities. First, a series of qualitative studies among church pastors and congregants will be necessary to formulate a survey instrument to measure perceptions and attitudes about church-sponsored messages in CRC cancer communication materials disseminated via church networks and traditional media networks. Second, the newly developed instrument will be administered to a sample of church- going and church-affiliated individuals to further assess and quantify attitudes and perceptions. Third, a pilot intervention will be conducted to test the impact of church-sponsored messages on perceptions and CRC cancer preventive behaviors. This study is strategically designed to build new understanding of the impact of the church and religiosity on perceptions and behavior that will help the optimization of CRC cancer screening among this population.    Project Narrative African Americans die or suffer from colorectal cancer disproportionately when compared to other races in the U.S. Because African Americans are one of the largest groups that report high religious attendance, this study examines the influence of the African American church in increasing colorectal cancer screening among this population. The church is examined as a sponsor of cancer screening promotion compared to traditional cancer organizations (e.g. American Cancer Society) that promote prevention and screening.

"Establishing Clinical Feasibility of the Raman Assay for Colorectal Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ChemImage Corporation, a 2014 Tibbetts Award recipient, in collaboration with GastroIntestinal Associates and the Allegheny Center for Digestive Health, proposes a disruptive technology based on high throughput Raman Molecular Imaging (RMI) spectroscopy for colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis called the Raman Assay for Colorectal Cancer (RACC). RMI involves the collection and evaluation of spatially resolved Raman spectra using supervised multivariate statistical analysis (i.e. chemometric) techniques. In preliminary Pilot Studies, RACC has been able to detect subtle changes in dried blood serum composition and protein conformation without the use of chemical reagents. RACC can differentiate between biobanked blood serum samples from patients with colorectal cancer versus those who are disease free with sensitivity and specificity of approximately 90%. Pilot studies conducted to date suggest RACC is sensitive to early stage CRC and the presence of polyps, including advanced adenomas, and if validated as technically and clinically feasible, RACC would have commercial value as a CRC screening in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay. In this proposed project which is relevant to the mission of the National Cancer Institute, ChemImage anticipates undertaking the first demonstration of the technical and clinical feasibility of RACC applied to fresh clinical blood serum samples. The longer term objective and intended use of the RACC Test will be as an aid in screening patients for pre-cancerous polyps and CRC. The RACC Test will be used by health care professionals who screen for CRC, including gastroenterologists and primary care physicians. In this Phase 1 study, RMI spectroscopy will be performed at low throughput using a Raman microscope operating with 785nm laser excitation without the use of reagents. In its mature commercial form, the RACC Test would be performed on a high throughput RACC instrument enabled by automated detection algorithms and software in =5 min per dried blood serum sample to minimize cost per assay. If validated for Intended Use as a CRC screening assay, we anticipate RACC will undergo Food and Drug Administration (FDA) premarket approval (PMA) and will require Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) National Coverage Decision. ChemImage has assembled a Regulatory Affairs & Reimbursement Advisory Group, with participation of experienced consultants having years of past experience within the FDA, CDRH, Office of IVD & Radiological Health, and CMS, whose goal is to increase the likelihood of successful commercialization. RACC has the potential to provide the detection performance approaching colonoscopy at costs comparable to fecal occult blood tests (FOBT), because it operates without the use of costly reagents. Since RACC would be applicable to blood serum samples, it is anticipated to have a very high compliance rate among target patient populations, and as a result improve the quality of care, and reduce the cost of managing CRC disease. Also of significance, as CRC disproportionally affects African American patients, the successful development of this assay would help reduce this healthcare disparity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Raman Assay for Colorectal Cancer (RACC) involves the application of Raman molecular imaging (RMI) spectroscopy to the analysis of blood serum samples. Preliminary results obtained from bio bank samples indicate excellent discrimination performance approaching 90% sensitivity and specificity for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC), but technical feasibility for application to fresh clinical samples needs to be established. If successful, RACC will be optimized in a high throughput configuration to provide a cost- effective in vitro diagnostics capability that will improve the quality of care in CRC screening an disease management.            ",Establishing Clinical Feasibility of the Raman Assay for Colorectal Cancer,8903926,R43CA189585,"['adenoma ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' In Vitro ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Polyps ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Protein Conformation ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Radiological Health ', ' Radiologic Health ', ' Reagent ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Serum Albumin ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Specificity ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Gastroenterologist ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Controlled Study ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' assay development ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Regulatory Affairs ', ' Resolution ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Collection ', ' Molecular ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' molecular imaging ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' cost ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Cancerous ', ' commercialization ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' screening ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' ']",NCI,CHEMIMAGE CORPORATION,R43,2015,115962,0.2879590634822018
"Strategies and Opportunities to Stop Colon Cancer in Priority Populations DESCRIPTION: The federal government has set a Healthy People 2020 goal of a 70.5% screening rate for colorectal cancer (CRC), but almost half of eligible U.S. adults are not up to date on their screenings. Among minority and low-income populations, the CRC screening rate is extremely low. To address this disparity, we will develop and test a culturally tailored, health care system-based program to improve CRC screening rates in OCHIN, a community-based collaborative network of more than 200 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). Racial and ethnic minorities, along with low-income and medically underserved populations, increasingly receive their primary care at FQHCs, which serve nearly 19 million patients annually throughout the United States. OCHIN is the largest national FQHC network. Its integrated electronic health record system combining medical, laboratory, and claims data will serve as a novel and robust data source for our study. In Phase I (Year 01), we will pilot-test an evidence-based approach to improving participation in CRC screening in two OCHIN FQHCs. This phase will include an assessment of the intervention s feasibility, effectiveness, and cost. In Phase II (Years 02 05), we will conduct a comparative effectiveness pragmatic clinical trial, using a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of our CRC screening program designed explicitly for FQHC clinics. Throughout the project, we will work with a diverse planning advisory group of OCHIN clinicians and patients, community representatives, state policy makers, and researchers, using principles of Community-Based Participatory Research. Because OCHIN is the largest single FQHC network and serves patients who are diverse in race, ethnicity, and insurance status, our results will play a transformative role in accelerating CRC screening research in underserved populations. Our program will expand meaningful use of electronic health information; synergistically meet national goals to improve cancer screening rates, address health disparities, and reduce health care costs; and act as a catalyst for future systems-based approaches to improve care delivery in FQHCs and other health systems.

"Helicobacter pylori protein-specific antibodies and colorectal cancer risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common and third most deadly cancer in the US. Current evidence suggests that CRC incidence is increasing among both men and women younger than 50 years of age, who are also more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage disease. Additionally, there is a significant racial disparity, in that African American men and women experience a higher incidence of colorectal cancer compared to white men and women, and an even higher rate of death from colorectal cancer compared to the white population. Recent studies suggest that infection with Helicobacter pylori, a known gastric-cancer carcinogen, may also increase the risk of CRC, although these findings have been inconsistent. Two recent meta-analyses found statistically significant 40% to 50% increased odds for CRC among H. pylori-positive individuals. However, the majority of the studies surveyed did not take into account the H. pylori sub-type. It is known that, as H. pylori has evolved over 50,000 years to live in the human stomach, the bacteria have become highly diverse genetically. The proposed project builds on our work in the Southern Community Cohort Study, in which we found a statistically significant 60-80% increase in the odds of CRC for individuals sero-positive for one of five specific H. pylori proteins. For colon cancer alone, thes associations were stronger, so that sero- positivity to any of these five proteins was associated with a significant, approximate two-fold increased risk, most prominently for the known H. pylori virulence factor VacA (OR for VacA sero-positivity, 2.24). The association of VacA sero-positivity was particularly strong for CRC that has distant spread (OR, 5.67), among younger (<55 y) individuals (OR, 3.48), and for cancer of the right colon (OR, 3.13). Furthermore, a strong, significant, positive dose-response association across increasing quartiles of VacA antibody level was also observed. The current project seeks to produce the most definitive study to date of the H. pylori-CRC association through evaluation of the association in a large, collaborative nested case-control study (including over 4,000 prospectively-ascertained cases from 10 cohort studies spanning the US, and 1:1 matched controls), assessment of differences in the association by time from blood collection to diagnosis, and examination of the potential interaction of regular aspirin use on the association of H. pylori protein-specific infection with CRC risk. Thus, the current project allows us to thoroughly evaluate the novel association between Helicobacter pylori protein-specific infection and CRC risk, particularly for aggressive disease, building the groundwork for significantly strengthening CRC prevention and screening strategies with a new risk biomarker. Furthermore, this project provides the opportunity to potentially identify an infectious exposure to a common cancer that may be modifiable by a regimen of regular aspirin use, and moreover has already been proven to be modifiable through the use of H. pylori-eradication therapy and, thus, possibly holds great promise as a CRC prevention strategy.               PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer is the third most common and deadly cancer in the US, and there is evidence that colorectal cancer incidence is increasing among both men and women younger than 50 years of age, who are also more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage disease.

"Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions to Improve Screening Among Rural Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2014 approximately 310,030 women in the United States (U.S.) will be diagnosed with breast cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CC), or colorectal cancer (CRC), and 68,060 women will die from these cancers. These three cancers account for 39% of the cancer burden and 25% of the cancer mortality among women in the U.S. Although effective screening tests are widely available for all three cancers, many women do not adhere to screening guidelines. Furthermore, the burden of these cancers is higher among some population groups and regions. Thirty-two rural counties in northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana share similar socioeconomically underserved populations of predominately (96.2%) white women who have elevated BC, CRC, and CC mortality rates, and lower screening rates with mammography, Pap tests, and fecal occult blood testing or colonoscopy. No known intervention has addressed improving screening rates for these three main female cancers simultaneously, even though multiple health behavior change research is emerging as a new model to change the way in which interventions can be packaged. The proposed project uses an overall theoretical framework to understand health disparities which includes individual, social and community level variables, and a conceptual model for the intervention which uses a multiple behavior theoretical approach, all of which have demonstrated efficacy in improving adherence to single screening test behaviors, as well as other preventive health behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to test the comparative effectiveness of a tailored interactive computer program delivered via DVD (TIDVD) vs. a TIDVD + telephone-based patient navigation (PN) intervention (TNI) vs. Usual Care (UC) to increase guideline-based screening rates for BC, CC, and CRC among women age 50 to 74 living in these rural counties of Ohio and Indiana. Specific aims are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of a tailored and interactive DVD (TIDVD) vs. TIDVD + telephone-based PN intervention (TNI) vs. UC, to increase guideline-based cancer screening rates at 12 months post randomization for BC, CC, and CRC among 1058 women age 50 to 74 living in rural northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana; and 2) compare the cost effectiveness of the TIDVD and the TIDVD + TNI intervention vs. UC, for adherence to each screening outcome or combination of screening tests. As an Exploratory Aim, we will identify associations between theoretical variables (community, social, and individual) and screening outcomes, including interactions with the interventions. If found to be cost effective, either or both interventions hae the potential to be immediately disseminated to increase BC, CC, and CRC screening rates and ultimately reduce cancer disparities for underserved rural women.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Breast cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CC), and colorectal cancer (CRC) account for 39% of the cancer burden and 25% of the cancer mortality among women in the United States (U.S.).

The FPRC's health priority will be the reduction of cancer disparities, and the core research project for the next five years will focus on the promotion of colorectal cancer screening (CRCS). The FPRC's mission and core research are responsive to the Guide to Community Preventive Services' focus on multilevel interventions to increase screening for cancer. The core research project will focus on colorectal cancer (CRC), selected by our State partner - the Florida Department of Health (FDOH), because it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women in the U.S. While scientific cancer advances are occurring, racial ethnic minorities and the medically underserved have consistently experienced the highest CRC mortality rates. The aims of the core research project are to: 1) examine disparities in late stage colorectal cancer incidence and screening rates to identify priority populations; 2) identify appropriate and feasible evidence-based interventions (EBI) for the priority populations; 3) conduct formative research with priority populations and key stakeholders to assess the EBIs' acceptability and to tailor EBIs to better meet priority population(s)' preferences and needs; and 4) implement and evaluate the multilevel intervention and make recommendations for future programs and policies in the state of Florida. This proposal makes three significant contributions to prevention research. First, the FPRC will work with FDOH, a community committee and other stakeholders (e.g., American Cancer Society) to test the CBPM for Systems Change framework's ability to select, tailor, promote, monitor, evaluate, and disseminate EBIs to reduce colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) health disparities. This planning framework has the potential to equip prevention researchers, health department and community partners with an effective planning framework that accelerates the translation of research to practice. Lessons learned from this demonstration project will be used to enhance the FPRC's training website and provide technical assistance to other State health departments and community partners. Second, the FPRC and its partners will create a computer simulation model of the system in which CRCS disparities are embedded and identify evidence-based interventions appropriate for addressing determinants at multiple levels in that system. This model and formative research results will be used to design an integrated, multilevel intervention for reducing CRC disparities. The intervention will be evaluated and the feasibility of scaling it up to other communities assessed. A dissemination plan will be created for effective components. Third, the FPRC will use lessons learned from the new and previous demonstration projects to enhance the CBPM training website and mentor other public health agencies and community partners that adopt it.                  Project Narrative The Florida Prevention Research Center (FPRC) uses community-based prevention marketing (CBPM) for systems change to develop, adapt, implement, evaluate, and disseminate evidence-based approaches to strengthen state and local health departments' and community coalitions' capacity for sustained disease prevention and health promotion. The FPRC's health priority will be the reduction of cancer disparities, and the core research project for the next five years will focus on the promotion of colorectal cancer screening (CRCS).",Community Based Prevention Marketing for Systems Change: Reducing Disparities,8853803,U48DP005024,[''],NCCDPHP,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,U48,2015,844774,0.14207934157384575
"Variations in Needs after Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Survivorship after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer, the third most common cancer in men and women, has many challenges. Research has shown that colorectal cancer survivors have unmet needs and worse physical and mental quality of life compared to individuals without cancer. Medically underserved populations are known risk groups for poor survivorship care, poor quality of survival, and poor quality of life after colorecal cancer. Sexual minority populations are medically underserved, according to a recent Institute of Medicine Report, yet at present their survivorship care and their quality of life after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer is unknown. The proposed study will determine whether disparities linked to sexual orientation exist in colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life. We will obtain a population-based sample of colorectal cancer survivors who differ by sexual orientation, applying our previously tested recruitment method, which uses cancer registry data from geographic areas with an above average density of sexual minority individuals. After collecting survey data on health care and quality of life, from heterosexual and sexual minority survivors, we will test three study hypotheses: 1) Sexual minority survivors will have poorer quality health care compared to heterosexual survivors, even after controlling for disease and non-disease factors. 2) Heterosexual survivors' quality of life will be better than sexual minority survivors' quality of life, even after controlling for disease and non-disease factors and quality health care. And 3) Sexual minority survivors who are at ease with their sexual minority identity will have better quality health care and quality of life than sexual minorty survivors who have difficulty with their identity. This study will be the first to comprehensively examine sexual minority colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life, illuminating the mechanisms that influence health care and quality of life. The findings will consist of modifiable and non-modifiable factors associated with sexual minority and heterosexual colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life. Researchers, health care providers, and policy makers can then intervene to address the modifiable factors identified by this study to facilitate improvement in diverse colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life. Thi research is critically needed to realize the Institute of Medicine's goals of improving survivorshi in this special population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this study will provide information about the quality health care and the quality of life of colorectal cancers survivors of different sexual orientations. From the individual interviews with lesbian, gay, and bisexual survivors of colorectal cancer, we will derive salient factors to be included in our survey questionnaire. Using quantitative survey data obtained from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual survivors of colorectal cancers, who were recruited from three cancer registries, we will determine whether there are disparities by sexual orientation in colorectal cancer survivor's quality health care and quality of life. Ultimately, this population-based approach to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual colorectal cancer survivorship is a necessary step on which we expect to build with follow-up research that will use the findings of this study for the development and testing of interventions to improve the needs of lesbian, gay, and bisexual colorectal cancer survivors.",Variations in Needs after Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis,8874926,R01CA181392,"['Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Buffers ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Elements ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Perception ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' Reporting ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' Sampling ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved population ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' metastatic colorectal ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' medically underserved ', ' demographics ', ' population based ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia  ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2015,675649,0.06789680106115636
"Internet-based Motivational Interviewing for Colonoscopy in African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to other racial groups, African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) morbidity and mortality rates. Although colonoscopies can prevent CRC, nearly half of African Americans (40.2%) have not received a screening colonoscopy within the recommended time frame (one colonoscopy per ten years). It is critical to increase African Americans' screening colonoscopy rates in order to reduce racial inequities in CRC morbidity and mortality. Dr. Miller's pilot work, as well as the current literature, suggest that an Internet-based Motivational Interviewing Intervention for Colonoscopy (I-MIIC) may help improve African Americans' screening colonoscopy uptake. The proposed project will first field-test the intervention, using an iterative approach, with African Americans referred for a screening colonoscopy (N=40). The field-testing results will guide the development, revisions, and finalization of the I-MIIC. Then, a randomized clinical trial will examine the efficacy of the -MIIC for improving African Americans' screening colonoscopy uptake. Participants (N=200) will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (N=100) in which they engage in a 20-minute I-MIIC intervention or a control group (N=100) in which they review a print brochure on CRC screening. The results will contribute to the growing literature on CRC disparities. Dr. Sarah Miller is the ideal candidate to spearhead this line of research given her academic and clinical background in CRC disparities and motivational interviewing. Dr. Miller's long-term goal is to become an independent researcher with expertise in the early detection and prevention of cancer in racial/ethnic minorities. To achieve her goals, as part of the K07, Dr. Miller will receie intensive training in four areas: 1) qualitative research; 2) e-Health; 3) longitudinal data analyss, and 4) professional development. The K07 will provide Dr. Miller with a variety of avenues to achieve her training goals and enhance her expertise. In particular, Dr. Miller will have ongoing meetings with seasoned mentors as well as participate in formal coursework, workshops, conferences, and interactive trainings. The proposed K07 will form the foundation for a program of research that focuses on improving cancer screening uptake in racial/ethnic minorities with the goal of reducing disparities. At the end of the K07 funding period, Dr. Miller will submit an R01 application, based on the results of the present study. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) is the ideal environment for Dr. Miller to complete her proposed research project and training. In particular, the ISMMS can offer Dr. Miller: 1) the resources necessary to complete her research; 2) access to multiple training activities; and 3) access to a diverse patient population. Most importantly, Dr. Miller will receive guidance from a team of superior mentors with expertise in: CRC disparities, qualitative research, biostatistics, e-Health, and primary care. The mentoring team will work closely with Dr. Miller to ensure that she achieves her research and training objectives. Overall, the K07 will provide Dr. Miller with the research experience, intensive training, and mentorship needed to become a successful independent researcher.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research has significant public health relevance. The development of an Internet-based motivational interviewing intervention for colonoscopy (I-MIIC) to increase African Americans' screening colonoscopy uptake will help to reduce disparities in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates. If the I- MIIC proves efficacious, there is a strong argument to replicate this intervention with other vulnerable populations and with other cancer tests.            ",Internet-based Motivational Interviewing for Colonoscopy in African Americans,8965692,K07CA190726,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Appointment ', ' Attention ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Control Groups ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Patients ', ' Polyps ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Printing ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Seasons ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Test Result ', ' meetings ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Reporting ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Preventive ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Population Intervention ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Premalignant ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Preparation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Cancerous ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' patient population ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' e-Health ', ' eHealth ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K07,2015,170640,0.23616207167541448
"Race, pathomolecular signature and colorectal cancer survival ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd most common malignancy in the US and the third leading cause of cancer death. Compared to European Americans (EAs), African Americans (AAs) have a substantially higher CRC mortality rate that is a function of both a higher incidence rate and lower survival rate. Racial disparities in survival persist even after controlling for stage at diagnosis. The reasons for this are not known, but possible explanations include racial differences in aggressiveness of the tumors, socioeconomic variables, and or treatment-related factors. The training and research plan proposed in this K07 career development award will enable me to transition to the next phase of my academic career as an independent investigator in molecular and genetic cancer epidemiology. The training plan consists of several complementary activities including: (1) didactic training (formal coursework/workshops), (2) wet-laboratory experience, (3) attendance at national conferences and seminars (4) mentored clinical research and training in the responsible conduct of research. The primary goal of the research plan is to investigate the role of race, pathologic and molecular prognostic indicators and CRC survival. The research plan is carried out in two studies. In Aim one, a clinic-based study, we will perform a cross-sectional analysis to provide a comprehensive and accurate summary of the pathologic, molecular, and pathomolecular features of primary and metastatic tumors in AAs and EAs with CRC. Specifically, we will estimate the proportion of poor pathologic (e.g. histologic type, colonic location, grade) and molecular (e.g. KRAS, BRAF, p53, CIMP, MSI) prognostic indicators in AAs compared to EAs. In Aim 2, building on Aim 1, we will perform a survival analysis in a cohort of CRC patients to examine the joint influence of race and pathologic and molecular prognostic indicators on survival. Specifically, we will test the hypotheses that after adjustment for confounding variables, (a) younger (<50 years old) AAs compared to EAs will have a higher proportion of poor pathomolecular prognostic indicators and worse survival and (b) older (e 50 years old) AAs compared to EAs will have similar proportions of poor pathomolecular prognostic indicators and similar survival. The combination of the candidate's commitment to understanding the etiology of the racial disparity in colorectal neoplasia, the excellence and expertise of her mentoring team and the strong institutional commitment of the Medical University of South Carolina (a designated National Cancer Center) to reduce the racial disparities in cancer will help the applicant become an independent researcher. The research findings from the present proposal will culminate in a submission of an R01 in year 4 of the award. Ultimately, my goal is draw on the techniques in molecular and genetic epidemiology to reduce the disparities in incidence and survival between AAs and EAs in South Carolina and beyond. Public Health Relevancy Statement Colorectal cancer is the source of significant morbidity and mortality especially among African Americans. Studies, like the one proposed, seek to understand the etiology of the racial disparities in colorectal cancer and hence provide insights into the mechanisms of the disease process. We envision the present proposal as part of the larger question of exploring, understanding, and improving outcomes among AA diagnosed with colorectal cancer.","Race, pathomolecular signature and colorectal cancer survival",8906782,K07CA151864,"['Age ', ' Age Factors ', ' Award ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' large bowel neoplasm ', ' colorectal neoplasia ', ' Large Intestine Tumor ', ' Large Intestine Neoplasm ', ' Large Bowel Tumor ', ' Colorectal Tumors ', ' Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' neoplasia ', ' Neoplasms ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Medical ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Staging ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Reporting ', ' v-raf Murine Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog B1 ', ' RAFB1 ', ' BRAF ', ' B-raf-1 ', ' BRAF gene ', ' response ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' v-Ki-RAS2 Kirsten Rat Sarcoma 2 Viral Oncogene Homolog ', ' RASK2 ', ' Oncogene K-Ras ', ' Ki-RAS ', ' KRAS2 ', ' KRAS ', ' K-Ras-2 Oncogene ', ' K-Ras 2A ', ' K-RAS2B ', ' K-RAS2A ', ' C-K-RAS ', ' KRAS2 gene ', ' Address ', ' CIMP ', ' CpG Island Methylator Phenotype ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' medically underserved ', ' tumor ', ' treatment response ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' ']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K07,2015,130415,0.08603826631732904

"Culturally Targeted Loss Framed Messaging for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Afri DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary African-Americans are at a substantially increased risk of both developing and dying from colorectal cancer (CRC). This costly disparity can be largely attributed to African-Americans' diminished use of available CRC screenings. Although early detection of CRC via screening is highly beneficial, efforts to encourage their use among African-Americans have not been successful, suggesting a critical need to develop and evaluate effective health messaging strategies. In turn, health communication research has advocated the use of both loss-framed messaging and also personal prevention messaging to encourage illness detection b behaviors. However, the capacity of these messaging strategies to encourage CRC screening among African-Americans is not well understood. This includes limited knowledge about the potential of such messages to interface with perceptions of racism and medical mistrust that can impede screening behavior, and also whether loss-framed and personal prevention messages can be simultaneously employed to better promote CRC screening among African-Americans. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop health communications that reduce significant and costly ethnic health disparities, and to reveal psychological processes that underlie effective health messaging for ethnic minorities. The immediate objective of this application is to identify how gain and loss-framed messaging, as well as personal prevention messaging, may be used to reduce CRC screening disparities among African-Americans. The central hypothesis is that African-Americans will be best compelled to obtain screening for CRC when messages simultaneously emphasize personal prevention and are loss-framed. The specific aims are to 1) identify and compare effects of stand-alone gain versus loss- framed health messaging on African-Americans' CRC screening attitudes, intentions, and behavior; 2) identify and compare effects of gain versus loss-framed health messaging on African-Americans' perceived racism and medical mistrust; 3) determine the effect of coupling gain and loss-framed messages with a culturally-targeted personal prevention message on African-Americans' CRC screening attitudes, intentions, and behavior. The proposed research will develop and administer for unique versions of a CRC informational and screening video communication. These videos will be used to experimentally evaluate the effects of stand-alone and coupled loss-framed and personal prevention health messages on CRC screening attitudes, intentions, and behavior in a local sample of African-Americans. The proposed research will also identify the effects of health messages on perceived racism and medical mistrust. The public health implications of this project are significant. Namely, the proposed research will provide knowledge that is critical for developing and evaluating useful approaches to ethnic minority health messaging, and for better understanding how best to encourage cancer detection behaviors among African-Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative The proposed research will evaluate how broad-spectrum and culture-specific health messaging strategies can be combined to better promote colorectal cancer screening among African-Americans. The proposed research carries important public health implications in proposing to identify health communications that reduce a significant and costly ethnic health disparity, and in examining psychological processes that underlie effective health messaging for ethnic minorities.",Culturally Targeted Loss Framed Messaging for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Afri,8846073,R01CA175088,"['Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Prevention ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Advocate ', ' Detection ', ' Health Communication ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Communication Research ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,347598,0.2638926193310361
"The Interplay of Behavior, Environment, and Microbiota in Colorectal Cancer Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Tiffany Carson is an applied epidemiologist with a background in studying health disparities of black and white women. Dr. Carson's early work focused on behaviors related to diet, physical activity, obesity and related health outcomes. Recently, Dr. Carson has focused on applying her research efforts to better understand cancer disparities of black and white women. Dr. Carson's overarching career goal is to become an independently funded investigator and develop evidence-based bio-behavioral interventions to reduce cancer health disparities. To that end, this application proposes a rigorous research project and training plan focused on investigating the microbiota as a novel potential contributor to colorectal cancer (CRC) disparities between black and white women. CRC is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the United States    accounting for 9% of cancer deaths. Known risk factors for CRC include increasing age, male sex, family history, inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical inactivity, high consumption of red and processed meats and high fat diet, and obesity. Among women, even after accounting for differences in the distribution of risk factors, black women remain at 48% greater risk for CRC than white women. There is a growing body of research suggesting that the influence of diet on CRC risk is mediated through the microbiota and that microbial perturbations caused by diet, lifestyle, and antibiotics can lead to increased risk for CRC and other chronic diseases. Stress is one factor that has been shown to lead to alterations in the microbiota. Our research has shown that black women report moderate to high stress levels and additional published literature indicates that black women report higher stress levels than their white counterparts. These observations have lead to our hypothesis that a greater proportion of black women have a perturbed microbiota as a result of higher stress levels compared to white women, putting black women at greater risk for developing CRC. In the present proposal, we plan to explore this hypothesis employing a case control study design comparing the following groups: 1) black and white women with incident CRC from the Kirklin Clinic at UAB and 2) age-matched cancer-free black and white female community controls. Specifically, we will first characterize the oral and gut microbiota of black and white women with CRC and compare by race with particular focus on microbes known to be either positively or negatively associated with CRC. Because all cases will have CRC, we hypothesize that there will be no significant racial differences in the microbiota or other known risk factors for CRC such as diet. In contrast, when we repeat this experiment in cancer-free black and white female community controls, we expect to observe racial differences in the microbiota, with black women having less health-promoting bacteria and more pathogenic bacteria than white women, which would put black women at increased risk for CRC. We anticipate that a greater proportion of black females in the control group will have microbiota that resembles the microbiota of participants with CRC. Additionally, if our hypothesis is supported, psychological stress with be inversely associated with health-promoting bacteria and positively associated with pathogenic bacteria. Our findings will provide insight into how lifestyle factors that have not been fully explored to date such as stress may be associated with risk for CRC as a result of how stress perturbs the microbiota. If we determine that stress contributes to CRC risk via microbial perturbations, future bio-behavioral interventions that incorporate stress management and dietary/supplemental recommendations to promote mucosal health, and therefore reduce CRC risk, can be developed and implemented which could lead to diminished health care costs related to diagnosis and treatment and reduce CRC disparities between black and white women. In addition to providing valuable data, the proposed research project will also provide the opportunity for the additional training needed for Dr. Carson's development as an independently funded bio-behavioral cancer disparities researcher. Dr. Carson will engage in an intensive, structured training experience to develop expertise by completing the following: 1) Training in the recruitment of racially diverse clinical and community populations for bio-specimen and bio-banking research, 2) Obtaining hands-on and didactic training in bioinformatics techniques, and 3) Improving professional skills such as team science, networking, grant writing, mentoring, and high-impact publications. Under the guidance of an esteemed panel of mentors and collaborators and the high quality research and training environment that the University of Alabama at Birmingham offers, Dr. Carson's research and training experiences will make a significant contribution to the scientific community and Dr. Carson's overall career development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the USA, and the disparity between black and white women remains unexplained. This study will evaluate novel biological, behavioral and environmental factors that may contribute to this disparity. Findings from this study will provide insight into whether stress and the microbiot contribute to risk for CRC and possibly lead to innovative interventions to reduce CRC incidence and disparities.","The Interplay of Behavior, Environment, and Microbiota in Colorectal Cancer Risk",8967533,K01CA190559,"['Research Project Grants ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Techniques ', '

"CRC Screening Thoughts and Feelings: Increasing Engagement of African Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality of any ethnic/racial group. While screening, and particularly colonoscopy, is effective in reducing the incidence of CRC, adherence is low. In fact, a newly released modeling study suggests that disparities in screening accounts for over 40 percent of incidence disparities and almost 20 percent of mortality disparities. This is particularly true for African Americans; further, they are less likely to receive influential physician referrals for screening. There is a critical need to improve our understanding of adherence and the factors which influence African Americans' decisions about engaging in CRC screening, as well as efficacious intervention strategies. Behavioral research has shown links to cognitive decision-making factors (perceived benefits and barriers) and affective decision-making factors (fear and worry) in predicting CRC screening and intentions to screen. However, little or no work has systematically examined these factors in African Americans; this creates significant gaps in knowledge about the role of these factors in predicting (and potentially increasing) CRC screening for minorities. The goal of the proposed application is to understand factors influencing the decisions of African Americans to engage in (or not engage in) screening for CRC and the ability to positively impact these factors through intervention strategies at a community level. The central hypotheses are: a) that decisions to engage in CRC screening will be a function of both cognitive and affective factors; and b) that educational interventions can effectively alter both affective and cognitive factors and therefore increase CRC screening rates for African Americans. The Specific Aims proposed to test our hypotheses are: Aim 1: Examine the impact of two randomized community interventions on cognitive and affective factors and their resulting influence on health care seeking and CRC screening behaviors for African Americans. Aim 2: Examine and explore contextual factors that may influence the process of behavior change to better understand CRC screening and health care seeking behaviors at the community level. This study will significantly increase our understanding of factors which influence African Americans' decisions about health care seeking and CRC screening behavior and whether a community-based intervention can positively impact these factors and behaviors to reduce disparities. Expected outcomes: the work proposed in these aims will provide crucial information about behavioral change specific to health care seeking and CRC screening by African Americans.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is relevant to public health because it studies the factors which influence African Americans' decisions about engaging in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and the potential effectiveness of community-based outreach interventions to impact these decisions for African Americans who have an excess incidence and mortality rate from this disease. The proposed study is relevant to the NIH mission pertaining to support of knowledge and research that will help reduce colorectal cancer health disparities.            ",CRC Screening Thoughts and Feelings: Increasing Engagement of African Americans,8842100,R01CA171935,"['Accounting ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' Health Care Seeking Behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Influentials ', ' Mission ', ' Study models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' behavior change ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Church ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' care seeking ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Age-Years ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Behavioral ', ' community intervention ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Affective ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' public health priorities ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R01,2015,629213,0.30223501520001494
"Effectiveness of Screening Colonoscopy in Reducing Deaths from Colorectal Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers of the colon and rectum (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the US, can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques. Although some expert groups in the US consider colonoscopy to be the standard, there is currently only limited direct evidence to support its increasing use for screening in average risk adults. Colonoscopy has higher risks and costs than other screening tests. Recent studies reported that colonoscopy did not reduce mortality from right-sided colon cancers, the part of the colon that is beyond the reach of sigmoidoscopy. However, those findings were controversial because that study was unable to distinguish screening from diagnostic uses or accurately assess the completeness of colonoscopies. This project's goal is to inform clinical and policy decisions by providing evidence to show whether the purported benefits of colonoscopy are realized in practice. The primary specific aim is to estimate the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy in reducing death from CRC among average-risk adults when compared to no screening, overall and separately for right- and left-sided cancers. Our secondary aims are to: 1) determine the impact of the completeness of colonoscopy examinations on its effectiveness; and 2) compare the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy relative to sigmoidoscopy. We will use a case-control design nested in an historical cohort of persons receiving care at 3 sites participating in a research consortium, Cancer Research Network (CRN). These sites provide the full continuum of cancer care to their members ranging from screening through end of life care, and provide access to information on CRC screening that can be linked to diagnosis and cause-specific mortality data on large numbers of racially and socioeconomically diverse persons. We will identify at least 1,200 cases of CRC deaths between 2007 and 2014 among enrollees who were 52 years or older at the date of the diagnosis, each matched within each health plan to two randomly selected controls based on age, sex and enrollment history. We will identify screening history for a minimum of 10 years prior to cancer diagnosis, differentiating screening from diagnostic procedures, using standardized targeted chart reviews and other sources. The sample size will provide sufficient power for separate evaluations of tumors located in the right colon. This project will be carried out by an experienced interdisciplinary team representing epidemiology, case-control methodology, biostatistics, gastroenterology and primary care. Team members are national leaders in CRC screening research and policy. This project is in synergy with existing NCI and the CRN goals to: 1) develop methods and approaches to provide clinical, policy-relevant information; and 2) inform clinical and public health decisions on CRC screening. This application is also responsive to the NCI's priority to improve understanding of the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of tests used in screening for CRC, a ""health disparity condition"", and addresses Healthy People 2010 goals to reduce cancer death.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, but many of these cancers can be detected at an early, more curable, stage or even prevented using available screening techniques. Although many people believe that colonoscopy is the best screening test, there is currently no scientific evidence to support that claim. The goal of our proposed study is to provide scientific evidence on whether current beliefs about the benefits of colonoscopy screening are realized in actual clinical practice in order to help patients, doctors, and policy makers make decisions about colon cancer screening.

"Variations in Needs after Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Survivorship after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer, the third most common cancer in men and women, has many challenges. Research has shown that colorectal cancer survivors have unmet needs and worse physical and mental quality of life compared to individuals without cancer. Medically underserved populations are known risk groups for poor survivorship care, poor quality of survival, and poor quality of life after colorecal cancer. Sexual minority populations are medically underserved, according to a recent Institute of Medicine Report, yet at present their survivorship care and their quality of life after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer is unknown. The proposed study will determine whether disparities linked to sexual orientation exist in colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life. We will obtain a population-based sample of colorectal cancer survivors who differ by sexual orientation, applying our previously tested recruitment method, which uses cancer registry data from geographic areas with an above average density of sexual minority individuals. After collecting survey data on health care and quality of life, from heterosexual and sexual minority survivors, we will test three study hypotheses: 1) Sexual minority survivors will have poorer quality health care compared to heterosexual survivors, even after controlling for disease and non-disease factors. 2) Heterosexual survivors' quality of life will be better than sexual minority survivors' quality of life, even after controlling for disease and non-disease factors and quality health care. And 3) Sexual minority survivors who are at ease with their sexual minority identity will have better quality health care and quality of life than sexual minorty survivors who have difficulty with their identity. This study will be the first to comprehensively examine sexual minority colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life, illuminating the mechanisms that influence health care and quality of life. The findings will consist of modifiable and non-modifiable factors associated with sexual minority and heterosexual colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life. Researchers, health care providers, and policy makers can then intervene to address the modifiable factors identified by this study to facilitate improvement in diverse colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life. Thi research is critically needed to realize the Institute of Medicine's goals of improving survivorshi in this special population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this study will provide information about the quality health care and the quality of life of colorectal cancers survivors of different sexual orientations. From the individual interviews with lesbian, gay, and bisexual survivors of colorectal cancer, we will derive salient factors to be included in our survey questionnaire. Using quantitative survey data obtained from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual survivors of colorectal cancers, who were recruited from three cancer registries, we will determine whether there are disparities by sexual orientation in colorectal cancer survivor's quality health care and quality of life. Ultimately, this population-based approach to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual colorectal cancer survivorship is a necessary step on which we expect to build with follow-up research that will use the findings of this study for the development and testing of interventions to improve the needs of lesbian, gay, and bisexual colorectal cancer survivors.",Variations in Needs after Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis,9091490,R01CA181392,"['Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Buffers ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Elements ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' Reporting ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' Sampling ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved population ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' metastatic colorectal ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' demographics ', ' population based ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobia  ', ' Homophobic ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2016,607762,0.06789680106115636
"MUC13 Mucin in Colorectal Cancer Health Disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most lethal malignancy in the USA and affects over a million people every year. A significant CRC health disparity exists between African Americans (AA), American Indians (AI) and Caucasians (CA) in relation to its occurrence, drug response and mortality. Due to this, the overall mortality is highr among AA/AI compared to CA. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this disparity in AA/AI are not known. Therefore, it is highly imperative to understand the molecular basis and the identification of biomarker(s) that can be used for early stage diagnosis, metastasis and drug response to reduce this unacceptable health disparity. Our laboratory has identified a novel transmembrane mucin, MUC13, which is highly overexpressed/aberrantly localized in CRC and is involved in its pathogenesis. Additionally, our recent preliminary data suggest a markedly higher and aberrant expression of MUC13 in AA/AI CRC samples compared to CA counter parts. We have shown that MUC13 is an important modulator of several signal-transduction pathways and affects multiple key proteins involved in cell growth and survival, such as sonic hedgehog, HER2 and p53. Our published and preliminary studies have suggested an aberrant expression of MUC13 which has implications in CRC progression and metastasis. Based on these compelling evidence, we hypothesize that the differential/aberrant expression of MUC13 and/or MUC13 variants are underlying factors associated with CRC health disparity. In addition, we hypothesize this differential MUC13 expression is regulated by certain microRNAs (miR-145 and miR-132) and inflammatory mediators produced by the tumor microenvironment (e.g. interleukin-6 mediated STAT5B phosphorylation) resulting in malignant colorectal cancer cells phenotypes among AA/AI populations. Three specific aims with comprehensive experimental approach are proposed to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we propose to study the expression profile of MUC13 in Caucasians, African Americans and American Indians CRC tissues and its correlation with disease progression, metastasis and patient survival. Aim 2 will investigate the presence of MUC13 spliced variants/single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their association with chemoresistance, metastasis and CRC health disparity. Aim 3 intends to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of MUC13 regulation in clinically relevant CRC tissues and cell line models. We will also investigate how various intrinsic factors can induce aberrant/ altered subcellular localization of MUC13, in clinically relevant CRC cell line models, as aberrant subcellular localization (cytoplasmic, nuclear) of MUC13 has also been associated with disease stage, prognosis and metastasis. The results of this multi factorial study will determine if MUC13 can be used as a molecular signature for early detection of aggressive and metastatic CRC in AA and AI. This comprehensive study will further provide important insights regarding MUC13 etiology in CRC and help in designing preventive and therapeutic strategies to reduce CRC mortality and CRC health disparity in underserved populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Underserved populations such as African Americans (AA) and American Indians (AI) are experiencing increasing prevalence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC), thus understanding the molecular basis of this disparity and the identification of molecular signatures that can be used for early stage diagnosis are highly desirable. This study will determine the role of MUC13, its variants/SNPs and its regulators (miRNAs, transcription factors and cytokines) in early diagnosis and disease progression and metastasis. Proposed study will provide important insights regarding MUC13 etiology in CRC and help in designing preventive and therapeutic strategies to lower CRC mortality and reduce the CRC health disparity in these highly underserved populations.            ",MUC13 Mucin in Colorectal Cancer Health Disparity,9090537,R01CA204552,"['Affect ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cytoplasm ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' Intrinsic factor ', ' Laboratories ', ' mortality ', ' Mucus Glycoprotein ', ' Mucins ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' cytokine ', ' TP53 gene ', ' p53 Genes ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' TRP53 ', ' TP53 ', ' P53 ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Signal Transduction Pathway ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions to Improve Screening Among Rural Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2014 approximately 310,030 women in the United States (U.S.) will be diagnosed with breast cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CC), or colorectal cancer (CRC), and 68,060 women will die from these cancers. These three cancers account for 39% of the cancer burden and 25% of the cancer mortality among women in the U.S. Although effective screening tests are widely available for all three cancers, many women do not adhere to screening guidelines. Furthermore, the burden of these cancers is higher among some population groups and regions. Thirty-two rural counties in northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana share similar socioeconomically underserved populations of predominately (96.2%) white women who have elevated BC, CRC, and CC mortality rates, and lower screening rates with mammography, Pap tests, and fecal occult blood testing or colonoscopy. No known intervention has addressed improving screening rates for these three main female cancers simultaneously, even though multiple health behavior change research is emerging as a new model to change the way in which interventions can be packaged. The proposed project uses an overall theoretical framework to understand health disparities which includes individual, social and community level variables, and a conceptual model for the intervention which uses a multiple behavior theoretical approach, all of which have demonstrated efficacy in improving adherence to single screening test behaviors, as well as other preventive health behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to test the comparative effectiveness of a tailored interactive computer program delivered via DVD (TIDVD) vs. a TIDVD + telephone-based patient navigation (PN) intervention (TNI) vs. Usual Care (UC) to increase guideline-based screening rates for BC, CC, and CRC among women age 50 to 74 living in these rural counties of Ohio and Indiana. Specific aims are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of a tailored and interactive DVD (TIDVD) vs. TIDVD + telephone-based PN intervention (TNI) vs. UC, to increase guideline-based cancer screening rates at 12 months post randomization for BC, CC, and CRC among 1058 women age 50 to 74 living in rural northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana; and 2) compare the cost effectiveness of the TIDVD and the TIDVD + TNI intervention vs. UC, for adherence to each screening outcome or combination of screening tests. As an Exploratory Aim, we will identify associations between theoretical variables (community, social, and individual) and screening outcomes, including interactions with the interventions. If found to be cost effective, either or both interventions hae the potential to be immediately disseminated to increase BC, CC, and CRC screening rates and ultimately reduce cancer disparities for underserved rural women.

"Reducing Colorectal Cancer Disparities: Racial Differences in Colorectal Polyp Profile ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths in the United States, about 136,000 new cases diagnosed and 50,000 dying from the disease each year. CRC racial disparities (26% higher incidence among Blacks and 52% higher mortality) have persisted at pre-2000 levels despite significant strides in population-wide colonoscopy screening. Nearly 60% of both Whites and Blacks are now covered by colonoscopy screening. Current screening recommendations (initiation of screening at 50 years of age regardless of race) are driven by an assumption that the prevailing CRC disparities are largely due to differences in access to screening and the quality of post diagnostic care.  However, in younger age groups, Blacks have twice the CRC incidence rate as Whites, and their stage- adjusted CRC survival rates are lower than Whites. Assuming that most CRCs arise from precancerous polyps that evolve into cancer, it is plausible that Blacks experience earlier polyp initiation and more rapid polyp progression to cancer. If such is the case, one potential factor in the persistent CRC disparities may be the race-neutral age guideline for screening initiation. However there is no direct evidence regarding age-related Black-White differences in precancerous polyps and the indicators of progression through the intermediate stages (polyp size and dysplastic histology). To establish such evidence, it requires a data source representing the polyp prevalence and profile in the population. In the absence of a large enough autopsy study, the next best alternative is a colonoscopy series validated to have achieved near-complete polyp clearance, and having complete polyp documentation. No such data source has been available so far.  Our study will leverage a unique polyp database generated by a previous NIH-funded study. It represents the nearest possible proxy to the population polyp prevalence and profile, and has sufficient statistical power to compare Blacks and Whites on polyp prevalence and cancer-relevant features within age strata. It is a large and well-documented database of a single-center colonoscopy series which is externally validated to have achieved near-complete polyp clearance: this cohort experienced 83% CRC incidence reduction and 89% CRC mortality reduction relative to the general South Carolina population over a 4.9-year of follow-up period. The rates are similar to those of the only colonoscopy clinical trial so far.  We will use data on ~17,681 colonoscopy patients with ~32,900 polyps (54% Black), and CRC data on this cohort obtained from the South Carolina Central Cancer Registry. We will study Black-White differences within 5-10 year age strata in: the presence of polyps, polyp number and features (size, histology, anatomic location, dysplasia status, and cancer), as well as combinations of these factors. We will use univariate statistical tests, multiple regressio (binary and ordered polynomial logistic regression, linear and Poisson regression) and cluster analysis. We will use sensitivity analyses to account for potential bias in the sample.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) have remained unabated from pre-2000 levels despite significant strides in population-wide colonoscopy screening. Studies suggest the plausibility of earlier initiation and more rapid polyp progression to cancer among Blacks although direct evidence is lacking. This study will explore a unique dataset generated by a previous study to investigate this question and could potentially facilitate changes in the recommended screening age and frequency for Blacks with implications for reducing CRC racial disparities.            ",Reducing Colorectal Cancer Disparities: Racial Differences in Colorectal Polyp Profile,9025150,R21CA202477,"['Accounting ', ' adenoma ', ' Age ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Carpet ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Histology ', ' Hyperplastic ', ' Hyperplasia ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' polynomials ', ' Polynomial Models ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Polyps ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Tubular ', ' Tubular formation ', ' Staging ', ' Morphology ', ' dyscrasia ', ' Dysplasia ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Frequencies ', ' Location ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' Sampling ', ' Documentation ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' large intestine polyp ', ' large bowel polyp ', ' Colo-rectal Polyp ', ' Colorectal Polyp ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Premalignant ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Villous ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' 10 year old ', ' ten year old ', ' age 10 years ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' cancer survival ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R21,2016,202741,0.26019843264406506
"Strategies and Opportunities to Stop Colon Cancer in Priority Populations DESCRIPTION: The federal government has set a Healthy People 2020 goal of a 70.5% screening rate for colorectal cancer (CRC), but almost half of eligible U.S. adults are not up to date on their screenings. Among minority and low-income populations, the CRC screening rate is extremely low. To address this disparity, we will develop and test a culturally tailored, health care system-based program to improve CRC screening rates in OCHIN, a community-based collaborative network of more than 200 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). Racial and ethnic minorities, along with low-income and medically underserved populations, increasingly receive their primary care at FQHCs, which serve nearly 19 million patients annually throughout the United States. OCHIN is the largest national FQHC network. Its integrated electronic health record system combining medical, laboratory, and claims data will serve as a novel and robust data source for our study. In Phase I (Year 01), we will pilot-test an evidence-based approach to improving participation in CRC screening in two OCHIN FQHCs. This phase will include an assessment of the intervention s feasibility, effectiveness, and cost. In Phase II (Years 02 05), we will conduct a comparative effectiveness pragmatic clinical trial, using a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of our CRC screening program designed explicitly for FQHC clinics. Throughout the project, we will work with a diverse planning advisory group of OCHIN clinicians and patients, community representatives, state policy makers, and researchers, using principles of Community-Based Participatory Research. Because OCHIN is the largest single FQHC network and serves patients who are diverse in race, ethnicity, and insurance status, our results will play a transformative role in accelerating CRC screening research in underserved populations. Our program will expand meaningful use of electronic health information; synergistically meet national goals to improve cancer screening rates, address health disparities, and reduce health care costs; and act as a catalyst for future systems-based approaches to improve care delivery in FQHCs and other health systems.

"CRC Screening Thoughts and Feelings: Increasing Engagement of African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality of any ethnic/racial group. While screening, and particularly colonoscopy, is effective in reducing the incidence of CRC, adherence is low. In fact, a newly released modeling study suggests that disparities in screening accounts for over 40 percent of incidence disparities and almost 20 percent of mortality disparities. This is particularly true for African Americans; further, they are less likely to receive influential physician referrals for screening. There is a critical need to improve our understanding of adherence and the factors which influence African Americans' decisions about engaging in CRC screening, as well as efficacious intervention strategies. Behavioral research has shown links to cognitive decision-making factors (perceived benefits and barriers) and affective decision-making factors (fear and worry) in predicting CRC screening and intentions to screen. However, little or no work has systematically examined these factors in African Americans; this creates significant gaps in knowledge about the role of these factors in predicting (and potentially increasing) CRC screening for minorities. The goal of the proposed application is to understand factors influencing the decisions of African Americans to engage in (or not engage in) screening for CRC and the ability to positively impact these factors through intervention strategies at a community level. The central hypotheses are: a) that decisions to engage in CRC screening will be a function of both cognitive and affective factors; and b) that educational interventions can effectively alter both affective and cognitive factors and therefore increase CRC screening rates for African Americans. The Specific Aims proposed to test our hypotheses are: Aim 1: Examine the impact of two randomized community interventions on cognitive and affective factors and their resulting influence on health care seeking and CRC screening behaviors for African Americans. Aim 2: Examine and explore contextual factors that may influence the process of behavior change to better understand CRC screening and health care seeking behaviors at the community level. This study will significantly increase our understanding of factors which influence African Americans' decisions about health care seeking and CRC screening behavior and whether a community-based intervention can positively impact these factors and behaviors to reduce disparities. Expected outcomes: the work proposed in these aims will provide crucial information about behavioral change specific to health care seeking and CRC screening by African Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is relevant to public health because it studies the factors which influence African Americans' decisions about engaging in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and the potential effectiveness of community-based outreach interventions to impact these decisions for African Americans who have an excess incidence and mortality rate from this disease. The proposed study is relevant to the NIH mission pertaining to support of knowledge and research that will help reduce colorectal cancer health disparities.",CRC Screening Thoughts and Feelings: Increasing Engagement of African Americans,9060903,R01CA171935,"['Accounting ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Seeking Behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Influentials ', ' Mission ', ' Study models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' behavior change ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Church ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' care seeking ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Behavioral ', ' community intervention ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Affective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' effective intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' public health priorities ', ' screening ', ' Preventive healthcare ', ' Preventive health care ', ' Preventative healthcare ', ' Preventative health care ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' ']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R01,2016,645851,0.30223501520001494
"Community Based Prevention Marketing for Systems Change: Reducing Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a Prevention Research Center that uses community-based prevention marketing (CBPM) to adapt, implement, evaluate, and disseminate evidence-based approaches to strengthen state and local health departments' and community coalitions' capacity for sustained disease prevention and health promotion. The FPRC's health priority will be the reduction of cancer disparities, and the core research project for the next five years will focus on the promotion of colorectal cancer screening (CRCS). The FPRC's mission and core research are responsive to the Guide to Community Preventive Services' focus on multilevel interventions to increase screening for cancer. The core research project will focus on colorectal cancer (CRC), selected by our State partner - the Florida Department of Health (FDOH), because it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women in the U.S. While scientific cancer advances are occurring, racial ethnic minorities and the medically underserved have consistently experienced the highest CRC mortality rates. The aims of the core research project are to: 1) examine disparities in late stage colorectal cancer incidence and screening rates to identify priority populations; 2) identify appropriate and feasible evidence-based interventions (EBI) for the priority populations; 3) conduct formative research with priority populations and key stakeholders to assess the EBIs' acceptability and to tailor EBIs to better meet priority population(s)' preferences and needs; and 4) implement and evaluate the multilevel intervention and make recommendations for future programs and policies in the state of Florida. This proposal makes three significant contributions to prevention research. First, the FPRC will work with FDOH, a community committee and other stakeholders (e.g., American Cancer Society) to test the CBPM for Systems Change framework's ability to select, tailor, promote, monitor, evaluate, and disseminate EBIs to reduce colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) health disparities. This planning framework has the potential to equip prevention researchers, health department and community partners with an effective planning framework that accelerates the translation of research to practice. Lessons learned from this demonstration project will be used to enhance the FPRC's training website and provide technical assistance to other State health departments and community partners. Second, the FPRC and its partners will create a computer simulation model of the system in which CRCS disparities are embedded and identify evidence-based interventions appropriate for addressing determinants at multiple levels in that system. This model and formative research results will be used to design an integrated, multilevel intervention for reducing CRC disparities. The intervention will be evaluated and the feasibility of scaling it up to other communities assessed. A dissemination plan will be created for effective components. Third, the FPRC will use lessons learned from the new and previous demonstration projects to enhance the CBPM training website and mentor other public health agencies and community partners that adopt it.                  Project Narrative The Florida Prevention Research Center (FPRC) uses community-based prevention marketing (CBPM) for systems change to develop, adapt, implement, evaluate, and disseminate evidence-based approaches to strengthen state and local health departments' and community coalitions' capacity for sustained disease prevention and health promotion.

Recent reductions in CRC incidence and mortality rates and improvements in stage at diagnosis and survival rates in the general U.S. population have been attributed to routine screening with prompt removal of polyps, early detection, and timely and appropriate treatment. AI/ANs are significantly less likely than non-Hispanic Whites to receive timely and risk- and age-appropriate cancer screenings, including recommended CRC screening. The short-term goal is to test the efficacy of serially implemented interventions designed to enhance annual CRC screening using the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Serial implementation refers to offering routine screening, irrespective of response to an earlier invitation, in concordance with national guidelines which recommend annual FIT testing between ages 50-75. The FIT is most appropriate because, based on consensus guidelines, it is an approved, high sensitivity fecal occult blood test that is offered annually and is available in Indian Health Service and tribal health facilities where resources to provide screening colonoscopy are limited. We will follow all positive FIT results with timely and appropriate diagnostic and treatment services. We address screening disparities through the testing of interventions designed to enhance annual CRC screening using the FIT among average- risk, on-reservation AIs aged 50-75 in the rural Southwest. The interventions are theory-informed, evidence- based, and graded in their intensity. The high intensity intervention will include navigated outreach, a mailed FIT kit, educational material, and follow-up reminders (Study Group 1). The medium intensity intervention will include a mailed FIT kit, educational material, and follow-up reminders (Study Group 2). The reference group (Study Group 3) will receive usual care (screening recommendation and a FIT kit at a clinic visit). We will use rigorous research methods to: (a) determine the efficacy of interventions to enhance annual CRC screening through completion of the FIT kit; (b) understand contextually relevant factors important for behavior change; (c) identify the most cost-effective strategies to enhance routine CRC screening; and (d) develop plans to inform sustainability and scalability. This is a collaborative effort between the University of New Mexico, the Albuquerque Area Indian Health Board (100% Indian-owned and operated), and six Pueblo Tribes in the rural Southwest. The research team has an extensive and successful history of conducting community based participatory cancer prevention research in collaboration with AI communities. Moreover, the research team recognizes the value of integrating a co-learning process and engaging in trust-based mutually beneficial research. Findings from this research could lead to an immediate increase in CRC screening and ultimately reduce the CRC disease burden among AIs experiencing cancer disparities and health inequities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age- and risk-appropriate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening coupled with prompt removal of polyps, early detection, and timely and appropriate treatment can reduce CRC incidence and mortality, detect and diagnose CRC at an earlier stage, and improve survival. However, American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have not benefitted equally from these gains in CRC control. To the best of our knowledge, no research has tested, with scientific and methodological rigor, strategies to enhance CRC screening among AIs. Documenting the efficacy of serially implemented CRC interventions designed to enhance the annual uptake of CRC screening tests among AIs can lead to broad implementation of evidence-based CRC screening interventions that could ultimately address the national and tribal priority of reducing CRC disparities among AIs.            ",Enhancing Prevention Pathways Towards Tribal Colorectal Health,9066409,R01CA192967,"['Age ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Priorities ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Directors ', ' Physician Executives ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' New Mexico ', ' Polyps ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' United States Indian Health Service ', ' Indian Health Service ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' Rural ', ' Program Sustainabilities ', ' Program Sustainability ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Consensus ', ' Test Result ', ' behavior change ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' tribal reservation ', ' reservation community ', ' native american reservation ', ' nation reservation ', ' American Indian reservation ', ' Indian reservation ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaska Native ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Address ', ' tribal health ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Reservations ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Pueblo ', ' Pueblo Race ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Coupled ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' efficacy testing ', ' health equity ', ' arm ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' trial design ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,R01,2016,584974,0.2943049524030131
"Culturally Targeted Loss Framed Messaging for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Afri DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary African-Americans are at a substantially increased risk of both developing and dying from colorectal cancer (CRC). This costly disparity can be largely attributed to African-Americans' diminished use of available CRC screenings. Although early detection of CRC via screening is highly beneficial, efforts to encourage their use among African-Americans have not been successful, suggesting a critical need to develop and evaluate effective health messaging strategies. In turn, health communication research has advocated the use of both loss-framed messaging and also personal prevention messaging to encourage illness detection b behaviors. However, the capacity of these messaging strategies to encourage CRC screening among African-Americans is not well understood. This includes limited knowledge about the potential of such messages to interface with perceptions of racism and medical mistrust that can impede screening behavior, and also whether loss-framed and personal prevention messages can be simultaneously employed to better promote CRC screening among African-Americans. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop health communications that reduce significant and costly ethnic health disparities, and to reveal psychological processes that underlie effective health messaging for ethnic minorities. The immediate objective of this application is to identify how gain and loss-framed messaging, as well as personal prevention messaging, may be used to reduce CRC screening disparities among African-Americans. The central hypothesis is that African-Americans will be best compelled to obtain screening for CRC when messages simultaneously emphasize personal prevention and are loss-framed. The specific aims are to 1) identify and compare effects of stand-alone gain versus loss- framed health messaging on African-Americans' CRC screening attitudes, intentions, and behavior; 2) identify and compare effects of gain versus loss-framed health messaging on African-Americans' perceived racism and medical mistrust; 3) determine the effect of coupling gain and loss-framed messages with a culturally-targeted personal prevention message on African-Americans' CRC screening attitudes, intentions, and behavior. The proposed research will develop and administer for unique versions of a CRC informational and screening video communication. These videos will be used to experimentally evaluate the effects of stand-alone and coupled loss-framed and personal prevention health messages on CRC screening attitudes, intentions, and behavior in a local sample of African-Americans. The proposed research will also identify the effects of health messages on perceived racism and medical mistrust. The public health implications of this project are significant. Namely, the proposed research will provide knowledge that is critical for developing and evaluating useful approaches to ethnic minority health messaging, and for better understanding how best to encourage cancer detection behaviors among African-Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative The proposed research will evaluate how broad-spectrum and culture-specific health messaging strategies can be combined to better promote colorectal cancer screening among African-Americans. The proposed research carries important public health implications in proposing to identify health communications that reduce a significant and costly ethnic health disparity, and in examining psychological processes that underlie effective health messaging for ethnic minorities.",Culturally Targeted Loss Framed Messaging for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Afri,9055660,R01CA175088,"['Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Prevention ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Advocate ', ' Detection ', ' Health Communication ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Communication Research ', ' Process ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' screening ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,282940,0.2638926193310361
"Transdisciplinary Team Science in Colorectal Cancer Prognosis: the ColoCare Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer will affect one in 20 individuals over the course of their lifetime. The ColoCare Study is a prospective cohort of men and women newly diagnosed with a first primary invasive colorectal cancer (stage I-IV) with repeat data and biospecimen collection beginning prior to surgery. The ColoCare Study was initiated at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center with subsequent consortium sites at the Moffitt Cancer Center, the German Cancer Research Center, and Huntsman Cancer Institute with institutional pilot/start-up funding to support patient recruitment. The goal of this study is to uniformly collet comprehensive sets of data and biospecimens from over 4000 multiethnic colorectal cancer patients at multiple time points (prior to surgery and 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post-surgery), including detailed treatment and risk factor data, fresh and fixed tumor and normal tissue, visceral adipose tissue, blood, stool, urine, saliva, and quantitative accelerometry data t assess physical activity. Each ColoCare Study site leverages existing infrastructure, including access to electronic medical records and NCI comprehensive/designated cancer center cores, while utilizing well-established protocols for recruitment, data collection, and biospecimen ascertainment that are consistently applied across all sites. Patients are followed up both actively and passively by study staff (in-person and through medical record reviews), as well as via linkages to cancer registry and vital status records. Currently, using pilot/institutional fund at four existing sites, we have recruited >1100 patients (n=1010 baseline bloods). With this infrastructure grant, we propose 1) to extend the ColoCare consortium to two new study centers that will enrich our numbers of underrepresented minority participants (University of Southern California, LA, and Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis) and 2) to continue and expand study procedures at all US sites, including energy balance assessments and molecular characterization of tumors. The support for expanded enrollment and continued follow-up of the ColoCare cohort will result in an estimated 4167 highly characterized enrollees. The repeat sampling of data and a diverse set of accompanying biospecimens at critical time points enables unprecedented epidemiologic and biomarker research that can inform clinical decision making and support evidence-based guidelines regarding lifestyle changes that impact outcomes. Additionally, we will establish an external advisory board and a community/participant advisory board to further guide infrastructure development and prioritize research use of this cohort. We will continue to participate in national and international consorti by contributing data and biospecimens. Support for this unique cohort of colorectal cancer patients will create a valuable resource for the broader research community. In-depth, repeated phenotyping within a single cohort will enable one-of-a-kind studies focused on the effects of health behaviors on prognosis, as well as the discovery of new biomarkers of clinically important outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    We propose to continue building and expanding the ColoCare Study, the only existing cohort of colorectal cancer patients for whom clinical data, information on health behaviors, and universal biospecimens have been systematically collected at repeat time points; ColoCare is uniquely suited for the discovery of new biomarkers of colorectal cancer treatment response and prognosis, as well as research that elucidates the influence of health behaviors on treatment efficacy and toxicity, quality-of-life, recurrence, and survival. We propose here to continue and augment collections at existing ColoCare sites, expand to two new sites that will focus on the recruitment of ethnic/racial minorities (over 4000 participants), and perform molecular characterization of tumor samples. This unique, multiethnic cohort will be an incredible resource for the broader research community, given its suitability for a wide-range of studies with potentially significant and near-term clinical

"Wired for Colorectal Cancer Screening: An mHealth Intervention 7. ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Medically underserved populations experience a disproportionate burden of CRC mortality. Fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is a simple, easy to do, and widely accessible screening modality that helps to diminish CRC mortality disparities. The effectiveness of FOBT to reduce CRC mortality depends heavily on adherence to annual testing. Unfortunately, repeat FOBT screening ranges from 14% to 44%. A novel approach to encourage repeat annual FOBT is a technology-driven low cost mobile health (mHealth) educational intervention. mHealth interventions have been shown to lead to behavior change in a variety diseases; however its use to facilitate annual CRC screening (CRCS) with FOBT has not been studied. There is a timely opportunity to promote repeat annual FOBT screening in an existing cohort of medically underserved men and women enrolled in a trial to increase initial uptake of fecal immunochemical test (FIT), a type of FOBT, at community based clinics. Assessment of repeat FIT is beyond the scope of the parent trial, but repeat FIT uptake is expected to be low. The subject of this application is to explore the efficacy of an innovative, low cost, educational, evidence-based and theory-based mHealth intervention to promote adherence to annual FIT in a medically underserved population. During Phase I, a series of educational, targeted, and actionable mHealth messages will be developed and refined. This will be achieved by iterative focus groups and mobile technology testing and troubleshooting with (n=35) patients seen in community clinics. During Phase II, the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the Wired for CRCS intervention to educate and prompt patients to repeat CRCS with FIT will be assessed. To achieve this, 120 members of the existing cohort of men and women who are not up to date on annual FIT will be recruited and randomized to the Wired for CRCS intervention arm or usual care arm. Those randomized to the Wired for CRCS intervention will receive a series of educational, targeted, and actionable messages (refined during Phase I) on their cell phone. FIT uptake will be assessed four months after baseline. It is expected that the Wired for CRCS intervention will result in greater FIT uptake compared to usual care. Successful completion of this research will provide preliminary information on feasibility, acceptability, efficacy, usability and utility of a technology solution for promoting repeat annual FIT in a diverse sample of patients at community clinics. With this evidence, the team will be poised for a larger trial expected to provide a more definitive test of educational mHealth interventions on adherence to CRCS with annual FIT. 8. NARRATIVE Annual fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) may help to diminish disparities in CRC mortality. Successful completion of this pilot trial will provide preliminary evidence for a larger trial to determine the impact of an educational mobile health (mHealth) intervention on adherence to CRC screening with an annual fecal immunochemical test, a type of FOBT. Ultimately, if an educational mHealth intervention is found to promote adherence to CRC screening, it could be applied widely in other community-based settings and in other cancer sites where beneficial screenings and other established biomedical interventions are underutilized.",Wired for Colorectal Cancer Screening: An mHealth Intervention,9172268,R03CA198580,"['Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' literacy ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uninsured ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved population ', ' cancer location ', ' cancer site ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' usability ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' trial design ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' ']",NCI,RBHS-SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R03,2016,97869,0.18708112423785195
"Vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk: an integrated molecular and genetic epidemiologic study PROJECT ABSTRACT This K99/R00 Career Development Award will provide the applicant, Dr. Warren Andersen, with the research experience and training to propel her into a career as an independent investigator in the field of genetic and molecular epidemiology with a focus on the interplay between race, modifiable risk factors, and the genetic determinants of cancer risk and outcomes. The research plan uses Mendelian randomization methods to evaluate the hypothesis that circulating and bioavailable vitamin D levels are associated with decreased colorectal cancer risk. Mendelian randomization (MR) methods can be used to evaluate the associations between long-term exposures and diseases by using genetic variants as instrumental variables in place of exposures. Dr. Warren Andersen will also assess whether vitamin D binding protein modifies the association between vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk. The project will leverage resources from three established epidemiologic consortia (the ColoRectal Transdisciplinary Study (CORECT) consortium, a colorectal cancer genome-wide association study consortium among African Americans, and the Asia Colorectal Cancer Consortium) and the Southern Community Cohort Study to evaluate associations in large samples including individuals of European, Asian and African descent. Dr. Warren Andersen will create race-specific genetic scores to represent circulating vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein. Fine-mapping will be conducted to identify potentially causal variants to be included in the vitamin D genetic scores. These genetic scores will then be assessed for associations with overall colorectal cancer risk, and colorectal cancer risk stratified by specific characteristics of the tumor such as COX-2 expression, PIK3CA mutation status, and stage. During the Career Development Award Dr. Warren Andersen will gain additional skills in genetic analysis and increase her knowledge in colorectal cancer biology and health disparities. The findings from this research project will be used to develop and submit two R01 level projects before the completion of the Career Development Award. The additional experience gained from this Career Development Award will prepare Dr. Warren Andersen to be a leader in the field of genetic and molecular epidemiology of cancer, with expertise in colorectal cancer etiology, genetic and cancer epidemiology, and the root causes of racial differences in disease risk. This research topic is of much significance, as the Institute of Medicine's 2010 Report stated, investigation into the causal relationships between vitamin D and total and site-specific cancers is an important research need. The use of MR and molecular epidemiologic methods should provide a more definitive answer to the questions of the relationships of colorectal cancer risk with circulating vitamin D, bioavailable vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein. This study will provide insight into colorectal cancer etiology and potentially identify subgroups of individuals who may benefit the most from vitamin D supplementation. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to conduct a large molecular epidemiologic study using fine-mapping and Mendelian randomization methods in Whites, Asians, and African Americans to provide more definitive evidence regarding the association of circulating vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein with colorectal cancer risk. We will further study tumor markers to investigate possible mechanisms for the associations. This study will improve our understanding of colorectal cancer etiology and provide valuable data for designing cost-efficient measures to reduce the risk of this common malignancy.",Vitamin D and

"The Interplay of Behavior, Environment, and Microbiota in Colorectal Cancer Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Tiffany Carson is an applied epidemiologist with a background in studying health disparities of black and white women. Dr. Carson's early work focused on behaviors related to diet, physical activity, obesity and related health outcomes. Recently, Dr. Carson has focused on applying her research efforts to better understand cancer disparities of black and white women. Dr. Carson's overarching career goal is to become an independently funded investigator and develop evidence-based bio-behavioral interventions to reduce cancer health disparities. To that end, this application proposes a rigorous research project and training plan focused on investigating the microbiota as a novel potential contributor to colorectal cancer (CRC) disparities between black and white women. CRC is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the United States    accounting for 9% of cancer deaths. Known risk factors for CRC include increasing age, male sex, family history, inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical inactivity, high consumption of red and processed meats and high fat diet, and obesity. Among women, even after accounting for differences in the distribution of risk factors, black women remain at 48% greater risk for CRC than white women. There is a growing body of research suggesting that the influence of diet on CRC risk is mediated through the microbiota and that microbial perturbations caused by diet, lifestyle, and antibiotics can lead to increased risk for CRC and other chronic diseases. Stress is one factor that has been shown to lead to alterations in the microbiota. Our research has shown that black women report moderate to high stress levels and additional published literature indicates that black women report higher stress levels than their white counterparts. These observations have lead to our hypothesis that a greater proportion of black women have a perturbed microbiota as a result of higher stress levels compared to white women, putting black women at greater risk for developing CRC. In the present proposal, we plan to explore this hypothesis employing a case control study design comparing the following groups: 1) black and white women with incident CRC from the Kirklin Clinic at UAB and 2) age-matched cancer-free black and white female community controls. Specifically, we will first characterize the oral and gut microbiota of black and white women with CRC and compare by race with particular focus on microbes known to be either positively or negatively associated with CRC. Because all cases will have CRC, we hypothesize that there will be no significant racial differences in the microbiota or other known risk factors for CRC such as diet. In contrast, when we repeat this experiment in cancer-free black and white female community controls, we expect to observe racial differences in the microbiota, with black women having less health-promoting bacteria and more pathogenic bacteria than white women, which would put black women at increased risk for CRC. We anticipate that a greater proportion of black females in the control group will have microbiota that resembles the microbiota of participants with CRC. Additionally, if our hypothesis is supported, psychological stress with be inversely associated with health-promoting bacteria and positively associated with pathogenic bacteria. Our findings will provide insight into how lifestyle factors that have not been fully explored to date such as stress may be associated with risk for CRC as a result of how stress perturbs the microbiota. If we determine that stress contributes to CRC risk via microbial perturbations, future bio-behavioral interventions that incorporate stress management and dietary/supplemental recommendations to promote mucosal health, and therefore reduce CRC risk, can be developed and implemented which could lead to diminished health care costs related to diagnosis and treatment and reduce CRC disparities between black and white women. In addition to providing valuable data, the proposed research project will also provide the opportunity for the additional training needed for Dr. Carson's development as an independently funded bio-behavioral cancer disparities researcher. Dr. Carson will engage in an intensive, structured training experience to develop expertise by completing the following: 1) Training in the recruitment of racially diverse clinical and community populations for bio-specimen and bio-banking research, 2) Obtaining hands-on and didactic training in bioinformatics techniques, and 3) Improving professional skills such as team science, networking, grant writing, mentoring, and high-impact publications. Under the guidance of an esteemed panel of mentors and collaborators and the high quality research and training environment that the University of Alabama at Birmingham offers, Dr. Carson's research and training experiences will make a significant contribution to the scientific community and Dr. Carson's overall career development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the USA, and the disparity between black and white women remains unexplained. This study will evaluate novel biological, behavioral and environmental factors that may contribute to this disparity. Findings from this study will provide insight into whether stress and the microbiot contribute to risk for CRC and possibly lead to innovative interventions to reduce CRC incidence and disparities.","The Interplay of Behavior, Environment, and Microbiota in Colorectal Cancer Risk",9130808,K01CA190559,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Alabama ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol

"Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions to Improve Screening Among Rural Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2014 approximately 310,030 women in the United States (U.S.) will be diagnosed with breast cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CC), or colorectal cancer (CRC), and 68,060 women will die from these cancers. These three cancers account for 39% of the cancer burden and 25% of the cancer mortality among women in the U.S. Although effective screening tests are widely available for all three cancers, many women do not adhere to screening guidelines. Furthermore, the burden of these cancers is higher among some population groups and regions. Thirty-two rural counties in northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana share similar socioeconomically underserved populations of predominately (96.2%) white women who have elevated BC, CRC, and CC mortality rates, and lower screening rates with mammography, Pap tests, and fecal occult blood testing or colonoscopy. No known intervention has addressed improving screening rates for these three main female cancers simultaneously, even though multiple health behavior change research is emerging as a new model to change the way in which interventions can be packaged. The proposed project uses an overall theoretical framework to understand health disparities which includes individual, social and community level variables, and a conceptual model for the intervention which uses a multiple behavior theoretical approach, all of which have demonstrated efficacy in improving adherence to single screening test behaviors, as well as other preventive health behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to test the comparative effectiveness of a tailored interactive computer program delivered via DVD (TIDVD) vs. a TIDVD + telephone-based patient navigation (PN) intervention (TNI) vs. Usual Care (UC) to increase guideline-based screening rates for BC, CC, and CRC among women age 50 to 74 living in these rural counties of Ohio and Indiana. Specific aims are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of a tailored and interactive DVD (TIDVD) vs. TIDVD + telephone-based PN intervention (TNI) vs. UC, to increase guideline-based cancer screening rates at 12 months post randomization for BC, CC, and CRC among 1058 women age 50 to 74 living in rural northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana; and 2) compare the cost effectiveness of the TIDVD and the TIDVD + TNI intervention vs. UC, for adherence to each screening outcome or combination of screening tests. As an Exploratory Aim, we will identify associations between theoretical variables (community, social, and individual) and screening outcomes, including interactions with the interventions. If found to be cost effective, either or both interventions hae the potential to be immediately disseminated to increase BC, CC, and CRC screening rates and ultimately reduce cancer disparities for underserved rural women.

"Promoting Colorectal Cancer Screening in Rural Emergency Departments DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural Appalachian Kentuckians suffer a disproportionate incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer death. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that as many as 60 percent of CRC related deaths could be prevented if everyone age 50 and older were screened regularly. Rural Appalachian residents are currently being screened at suboptimal rates. The proposed intervention builds on our successful cancer prevention projects: Faith Moves Mountains: A CBPR Appalachian Wellness and Cancer Prevention Program and Promoting Mammography among African American Women Visiting the Emergency Departments. Both projects involve lay health advisor (LHA) delivered motivational interviewing interventions that have been culturally tailored. We propose to pilot test a culturally tailored intervention using brief motivational interviewing by LHAs to promote CRC screenings in an emergency department (ED) serving rural Appalachian Kentucky in order to (1) evaluate the feasibility of the intervention in this rurl Appalachian setting; and (2) assess the effects of the intervention on perceived barriers to CRC screening and subsequent cancer screening engagement.  Consistent with our current Faith Moves Mountains and Promoting Mammography projects, we will train carefully selected community members (LHAs) to deliver a brief motivational interview while participants wait for non-urgent care in the ED or wait with a family member who is receiving care. Each participant, in conjunction with the LHA, will develop a written plan of action that addresses their identified barriers to screening. The brief intervention will take about 15 minutes and will be delivered in a private area of the ED. Control group participants will receive standard-of-care ED services that include brochure information identifying general cancer screening services provided by the hospital. Outcome measures will include assessment of barriers and receipt of CRC screening and will be measured at three and six months post intervention. The results will serve as preliminary data for a multisite rural ED-based clinical trial evaluating the cancer promotion intervention.

"Reducing Colorectal Cancer Disparities: Racial Differences in Colorectal Polyp Profile ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths in the United States, about 136,000 new cases diagnosed and 50,000 dying from the disease each year. CRC racial disparities (26% higher incidence among Blacks and 52% higher mortality) have persisted at pre-2000 levels despite significant strides in population-wide colonoscopy screening. Nearly 60% of both Whites and Blacks are now covered by colonoscopy screening. Current screening recommendations (initiation of screening at 50 years of age regardless of race) are driven by an assumption that the prevailing CRC disparities are largely due to differences in access to screening and the quality of post diagnostic care.  However, in younger age groups, Blacks have twice the CRC incidence rate as Whites, and their stage- adjusted CRC survival rates are lower than Whites. Assuming that most CRCs arise from precancerous polyps that evolve into cancer, it is plausible that Blacks experience earlier polyp initiation and more rapid polyp progression to cancer. If such is the case, one potential factor in the persistent CRC disparities may be the race-neutral age guideline for screening initiation. However there is no direct evidence regarding age-related Black-White differences in precancerous polyps and the indicators of progression through the intermediate stages (polyp size and dysplastic histology). To establish such evidence, it requires a data source representing the polyp prevalence and profile in the population. In the absence of a large enough autopsy study, the next best alternative is a colonoscopy series validated to have achieved near-complete polyp clearance, and having complete polyp documentation. No such data source has been available so far.  Our study will leverage a unique polyp database generated by a previous NIH-funded study. It represents the nearest possible proxy to the population polyp prevalence and profile, and has sufficient statistical power to compare Blacks and Whites on polyp prevalence and cancer-relevant features within age strata. It is a large and well-documented database of a single-center colonoscopy series which is externally validated to have achieved near-complete polyp clearance: this cohort experienced 83% CRC incidence reduction and 89% CRC mortality reduction relative to the general South Carolina population over a 4.9-year of follow-up period. The rates are similar to those of the only colonoscopy clinical trial so far.  We will use data on ~17,681 colonoscopy patients with ~32,900 polyps (54% Black), and CRC data on this cohort obtained from the South Carolina Central Cancer Registry. We will study Black-White differences within 5-10 year age strata in: the presence of polyps, polyp number and features (size, histology, anatomic location, dysplasia status, and cancer), as well as combinations of these factors. We will use univariate statistical tests, multiple regressio (binary and ordered polynomial logistic regression, linear and Poisson regression) and cluster analysis. We will use sensitivity analyses to account for potential bias in the sample. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) have remained unabated from pre-2000 levels despite significant strides in population-wide colonoscopy screening. Studies suggest the plausibility of earlier initiation and more rapid polyp progression to cancer among Blacks although direct evidence is lacking. This study will explore a unique dataset generated by a previous study to investigate this question and could potentially facilitate changes in the recommended screening age and frequency for Blacks with implications for reducing CRC racial disparities.",Reducing Colorectal Cancer Disparities: Racial Differences in Colorectal Polyp Profile,9343096,R21CA202477,"['Accounting ', ' adenoma ', ' Age ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Carpet ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' Hyperplastic ', ' Hyperplasia ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' polynomials ', ' Polynomial Models ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Polyps ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Tubular ', ' Tubular formation ', ' Staging ', ' Morphology ', ' dyscrasia ', ' Dysplasia ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Frequencies ', ' Location ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' Sampling ', ' Documentation ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' large intestine polyp ', ' large bowel polyp ', ' Colo-rectal Polyp ', ' Colorectal Polyp ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Premalignant ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Villous ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' 10 year old ', ' ten year old ', ' age 10 years ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' evidence base ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' cancer survival ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R21,2016,128345,0.26019843264406506
"A Multilevel CBPR Intervention to Improve Colorectal Cancer Screening in Underserved Vietnamese Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third highest cause of mortality in Vietnamese and Asian Americans. CRC incidence is rising rapidly in Vietnamese Americans, but they have among the lowest rates of CRC screening (14%) and are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease, which is highly preventable. Over 85% of Vietnamese Americans in our region (PA, NJ and NYC) are foreign-born with limited English proficiency, have low SES, and live in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Many lack knowledge about CRC risks and screening benefits, and have limited access to culturally appropriate preventive care. Thus, a multilevel intervention is needed to address the multiple barriers to and determinants of CRC screening in this community. Vietnamese community organizations (VCOs) serve dynamic social functions and represent an important resource for addressing this critical health disparity priority by promoting CRC screening. This project builds on established partnerships and successful work of Center for Asian Health, Temple University with Vietnamese CBOs that address their critical health disparities. CBPR principles will be applied to engage 20 VCOs in all phases of planning, implementing, evaluating, and disseminating a culturally appropriate, theory- and evidence-based multilevel CRC intervention. The proposed intervention will be guided by Social Ecological Model, which addresses sociocultural, behavioral and environmental determinants and intervention strategies at individual, interpersonal, and community organizational levels. CDC's Clinical Preventive Services Guidelines for adults 50+ (CPS) recommend that cancer screenings and other preventive services should be promoted. The standard CPS will be provided to both intervention and control groups, and intervention group will receive CPS + multilevel CRC intervention. Specific Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that CPS + multilevel CRC intervention will yield higher CRC screening rates compared to CPS control at 12-month follow up; Aim 2 is to examine whether CPS + multilevel CRC intervention (which includes CHW-led group education, automated and interactive text messaging and phone-based peer support) is more effective in changing screening determinants (e.g. KAB, self-efficacy, risk factors, lifestyles, social support, social norms, access barriers) than CPS control condition; and Aim 3 is to assess costs and cost-effectiveness of CPS + multilevel CRC intervention compared to CPS control condition in relation to CRC screening rates in order to inform future dissemination efforts. In sum, this project represents the first large-scale community-based randomized controlled trial of a multilevel, culturally-appropriate CBPR intervention to increase CRC screening among underserved Vietnamese.

"Helicobacter pylori protein-specific antibodies and colorectal cancer risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common and third most deadly cancer in the US. Current evidence suggests that CRC incidence is increasing among both men and women younger than 50 years of age, who are also more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage disease. Additionally, there is a significant racial disparity, in that African American men and women experience a higher incidence of colorectal cancer compared to white men and women, and an even higher rate of death from colorectal cancer compared to the white population. Recent studies suggest that infection with Helicobacter pylori, a known gastric-cancer carcinogen, may also increase the risk of CRC, although these findings have been inconsistent. Two recent meta-analyses found statistically significant 40% to 50% increased odds for CRC among H. pylori-positive individuals. However, the majority of the studies surveyed did not take into account the H. pylori sub-type. It is known that, as H. pylori has evolved over 50,000 years to live in the human stomach, the bacteria have become highly diverse genetically. The proposed project builds on our work in the Southern Community Cohort Study, in which we found a statistically significant 60-80% increase in the odds of CRC for individuals sero-positive for one of five specific H. pylori proteins. For colon cancer alone, thes associations were stronger, so that sero- positivity to any of these five proteins was associated with a significant, approximate two-fold increased risk, most prominently for the known H. pylori virulence factor VacA (OR for VacA sero-positivity, 2.24). The association of VacA sero-positivity was particularly strong for CRC that has distant spread (OR, 5.67), among younger (<55 y) individuals (OR, 3.48), and for cancer of the right colon (OR, 3.13). Furthermore, a strong, significant, positive dose-response association across increasing quartiles of VacA antibody level was also observed. The current project seeks to produce the most definitive study to date of the H. pylori-CRC association through evaluation of the association in a large, collaborative nested case-control study (including over 4,000 prospectively-ascertained cases from 10 cohort studies spanning the US, and 1:1 matched controls), assessment of differences in the association by time from blood collection to diagnosis, and examination of the potential interaction of regular aspirin use on the association of H. pylori protein-specific infection with CRC risk. Thus, the current project allows us to thoroughly evaluate the novel association between Helicobacter pylori protein-specific infection and CRC risk, particularly for aggressive disease, building the groundwork for significantly strengthening CRC prevention and screening strategies with a new risk biomarker. Furthermore, this project provides the opportunity to potentially identify an infectious exposure to a common cancer that may be modifiable by a regimen of regular aspirin use, and moreover has already been proven to be modifiable through the use of H. pylori-eradication therapy and, thus, possibly holds great promise as a CRC prevention strategy.

"A Multilevel CBPR Intervention to Improve Colorectal Cancer Screening in Underserved Vietnamese Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third highest cause of mortality in Vietnamese and Asian Americans. CRC incidence is rising rapidly in Vietnamese Americans, but they have among the lowest rates of CRC screening (14%) and are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease, which is highly preventable. Over 85% of Vietnamese Americans in our region (PA, NJ and NYC) are foreign-born with limited English proficiency, have low SES, and live in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Many lack knowledge about CRC risks and screening benefits, and have limited access to culturally appropriate preventive care. Thus, a multilevel intervention is needed to address the multiple barriers to and determinants of CRC screening in this community. Vietnamese community organizations (VCOs) serve dynamic social functions and represent an important resource for addressing this critical health disparity priority by promoting CRC screening. This project builds on established partnerships and successful work of Center for Asian Health, Temple University with Vietnamese CBOs that address their critical health disparities. CBPR principles will be applied to engage 20 VCOs in all phases of planning, implementing, evaluating, and disseminating a culturally appropriate, theory- and evidence-based multilevel CRC intervention. The proposed intervention will be guided by Social Ecological Model, which addresses sociocultural, behavioral and environmental determinants and intervention strategies at individual, interpersonal, and community organizational levels. CDC's Clinical Preventive Services Guidelines for adults 50+ (CPS) recommend that cancer screenings and other preventive services should be promoted. The standard CPS will be provided to both intervention and control groups, and intervention group will receive CPS + multilevel CRC intervention. Specific Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that CPS + multilevel CRC intervention will yield higher CRC screening rates compared to CPS control at 12-month follow up; Aim 2 is to examine whether CPS + multilevel CRC intervention (which includes CHW-led group education, automated and interactive text messaging and phone-based peer support) is more effective in changing screening determinants (e.g. KAB, self-efficacy, risk factors, lifestyles, social support, social norms, access barriers) than CPS control condition; and Aim 3 is to assess costs and cost-effectiveness of CPS + multilevel CRC intervention compared to CPS control condition in relation to CRC screening rates in order to inform future dissemination efforts. In sum, this project represents the first large-scale community-based randomized controlled trial of a multilevel, culturally-appropriate CBPR intervention to increase CRC screening among underserved Vietnamese.

"Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions to Improve Screening Among Rural Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2014 approximately 310,030 women in the United States (U.S.) will be diagnosed with breast cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CC), or colorectal cancer (CRC), and 68,060 women will die from these cancers. These three cancers account for 39% of the cancer burden and 25% of the cancer mortality among women in the U.S. Although effective screening tests are widely available for all three cancers, many women do not adhere to screening guidelines. Furthermore, the burden of these cancers is higher among some population groups and regions. Thirty-two rural counties in northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana share similar socioeconomically underserved populations of predominately (96.2%) white women who have elevated BC, CRC, and CC mortality rates, and lower screening rates with mammography, Pap tests, and fecal occult blood testing or colonoscopy. No known intervention has addressed improving screening rates for these three main female cancers simultaneously, even though multiple health behavior change research is emerging as a new model to change the way in which interventions can be packaged. The proposed project uses an overall theoretical framework to understand health disparities which includes individual, social and community level variables, and a conceptual model for the intervention which uses a multiple behavior theoretical approach, all of which have demonstrated efficacy in improving adherence to single screening test behaviors, as well as other preventive health behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to test the comparative effectiveness of a tailored interactive computer program delivered via DVD (TIDVD) vs. a TIDVD + telephone-based patient navigation (PN) intervention (TNI) vs. Usual Care (UC) to increase guideline-based screening rates for BC, CC, and CRC among women age 50 to 74 living in these rural counties of Ohio and Indiana. Specific aims are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of a tailored and interactive DVD (TIDVD) vs. TIDVD + telephone-based PN intervention (TNI) vs. UC, to increase guideline-based cancer screening rates at 12 months post randomization for BC, CC, and CRC among 1058 women age 50 to 74 living in rural northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana; and 2) compare the cost effectiveness of the TIDVD and the TIDVD + TNI intervention vs. UC, for adherence to each screening outcome or combination of screening tests. As an Exploratory Aim, we will identify associations between theoretical variables (community, social, and individual) and screening outcomes, including interactions with the interventions. If found to be cost effective, either or both interventions hae the potential to be immediately disseminated to increase BC, CC, and CRC screening rates and ultimately reduce cancer disparities for underserved rural women.

"Host-environment interactions in colorectal cancer disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a health burden worldwide that is highly prevalent and deadly but also preventable. African Americans (AAs) suffer disproportionately from CRC in the US, and biological factors underlying these disparities remain understudied. Environmental exposures, such as active vitamin D ( 1α,25(OH)2D3) , interact with normal colon to modify CRC development. If we could understand how these interactions differ between individuals or populations, they could be harnessed to identify those at highest CRC risk and potentially identify new ways to prevent this cancer. Until now, traditional models could not study host-environment interactions between individuals in human colon. To address this gap, we have established an experimental framework that uses primary ex vivo colon culture and human organoid culture to study inter-individual and inter-ethnic differences in responses to environmental exposures. Our initial work has identified a promising candidate, uridine phosphorylase 1 (UPP1), a key enzyme of uridine homeostasis and pyrimidine salvage that showed significant inter-ethnic differences in transcriptional response to 1α,25(OH)2D3. A knock out mouse of uridine phosphorylase led to spontaneous colon tumors due to DNA damage providing rationale for studying this candidate in the context of CRC disparities. In this exploratory study, we will test the hypothesis that 1α,25(OH)2D3  regulates uridine homeostasis and DNA damage in the colon, and that this regulation differs between populations (Aim 1). Having found that our experimental framework is productive and promising, we will extend it to identify inter-ethnic differences in gene expression and in chromatin accessibility in response to vitamin D with greater power compared to our preliminary study (Aim 2). Ultimately, this exploratory work is the basis for larger, comprehensive studies of inter-individual and inter-ethnic host-environment interactions in CRC susceptibility. In an era where the need for precision medicine at the individual and population level is recognized, our studies will determine how 1α,25(OH)2D3 responses differ across populations that eventually might lead to personalized vitamin D-based interventions for CRC prevention especially in AAs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Environmental factors play an important role in cancer development in the colon. By studying how individuals respond to environmental factors, such as vitamin D, we will learn about how cancer develops and it will be possible to predict who is at highest risk and would benefit from preventative interventions. This is especially important in African Americans who have the highest rates of colon cancer and are most likely to die from this preventable disease.",Host-environment interactions in colorectal cancer disparities,9301243,R21CA215380,"['Vitamin C ', ' VIT C ', ' Ascorbic Acid ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biology ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Chromatin ', ' Colon ', ' colon neoplasia ', ' Colonic Tumor ', ' Colonic Mass ', ' Colon Tumor ', ' Colon Neoplasms ', ' Colonic Neoplasms ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' DNA Injury ', ' DNA Damage ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Epithelium ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' mortality ', ' Organoids ', ' Play ', ' Pyrimidine ', ' Research ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Urd ', ' Uridine ', ' Uridine Phosphorylase ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' VIT D ', ' Vitamin D ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Vitamin D Receptors ', ' Vitamin D 3 Receptors ', ' Cholecalciferol Receptors ', ' Calcitriol Receptors ', ' 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Receptors ', ' 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 3 Receptors ', ' 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol Receptors ', ' Vitamin D3 Receptor ', ' base ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' KO mice ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Sample Size ', ' enzyme activity ', ' colo-rectal cancer prevention ', ' CRC prevention ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Chemoprevention ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Host Factor ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Allelic Imbalance ', ' protein expression ', ' Alpha Cell ', ' α-cell ', ' Glucagon Secreting Cell ', ' Glucagon Cell ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Address ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' colon carcinogenesis ', ' colorectal carcinogenesis ', ' high risk ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' precision medicine ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' epigenetic regulation ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2017,176175,0.1826764358470786
"Helicobacter pylori protein-specific antibodies and colorectal cancer risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common and third most deadly cancer in the US.

The current project seeks to produce the most definitive study to date of the H. pylori-CRC association through evaluation of the association in a large, collaborative nested case-control study (including over 4,000 prospectively-ascertained cases from 10 cohort studies spanning the US, and 1:1 matched controls), assessment of differences in the association by time from blood collection to diagnosis, and examination of the potential interaction of regular aspirin use on the association of H. pylori protein-specific infection with CRC risk. Thus, the current project allows us to thoroughly evaluate the novel association between Helicobacter pylori protein-specific infection and CRC risk, particularly for aggressive disease, building the groundwork for significantly strengthening CRC prevention and screening strategies with a new risk biomarker. Furthermore, this project provides the opportunity to potentially identify an infectious exposure to a common cancer that may be modifiable by a regimen of regular aspirin use, and moreover has already been proven to be modifiable through the use of H. pylori-eradication therapy and, thus, possibly holds great promise as a CRC prevention strategy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer is the third most common and deadly cancer in the US, and there is evidence that colorectal cancer incidence is increasing among both men and women younger than 50 years of age, who are also more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage disease. Additionally, there is a significant racial disparity, in that African American men and women experience a higher incidence of colorectal cancer compared to white men and women, and an even higher rate of death from colorectal cancer compared to the white population. The current project seeks to evaluate the novel association between Helicobacter pylori protein-specific infection and colorectal cancer risk, building the groundwork for significantly strengthening colorectal cancer prevention and screening strategies with a new risk biomarker, as well as the possibility of identifying an exposure that is proven to be modifiable through the use of eradication therapy, and may be modifiable by a regimen of regular aspirin use.",Helicobacter pylori protein-specific antibodies and colorectal cancer risk,9264935,R01CA190428,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibodies ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Aspirin ', ' Bacteria ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Colon ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Cytotoxin ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Future ', ' Gastric mucosa ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' malignant stomach neoplasm ', ' stomach pylorus cancer ', ' stomach fundus cancer ', ' malignant stomach tumor ', ' Stomach Cancer ', ' Malignant Gastric Tumor ', ' Malignant Gastric Neoplasm ', ' Gastric Pylorus Cancer ', ' Gastric Fundus Cancer ', ' Gastric Cardia Cancer ', ' Gastric Cancer ', ' Gastric Body Cancer ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Persons ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Serologic tests ', ' serology ', ' Serological Tests ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Stomach ', ' gastric ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Helicobacter Pylori Infection ', ' H.pylori infection ', ' H. pylori infection ', ' H pylori infection ', ' Helicobacter Infections ', ' H.pylori ', ' H. pylory ', ' H. pylori ', ' H pylory ', ' H pylori ', ' Campylobacter pylori ', ' C. pylori ', ' C pylori ', ' Helicobacter pylori ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Uninsured ', ' base ', ' Ovarian ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Death Rate ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' colo-rectal cancer prevention ', ' CRC prevention ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Proton Pump Inhibitors ', ' Distant ', ' interest ', ' Colorectal ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Seroprevalences ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' carcinogenicity ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Virulence Factors ', ' Pathogenicity Factors ', ' Low income ', ' Dose ', ' Age-Years ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Collection ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Virulent ', ' Modification ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' protective effect ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Cancer Prevention Study II ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' seropositive ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' ']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,553627,0.24370660517639
"Reducing Colorectal Cancer Disparities: Racial Differences in Colorectal Polyp Profile ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths in the United States, about 136,000 new cases diagnosed and 50,000 dying from the disease each year. CRC racial disparities (26% higher incidence among Blacks and 52% higher mortality) have persisted at pre-2000 levels despite significant strides in population-wide colonoscopy screening. Nearly 60% of both Whites and Blacks are now covered by colonoscopy screening. Current screening recommendations (initiation of screening at 50 years of age regardless of race) are driven by an assumption that the prevailing CRC disparities are largely due to differences in access to screening and the quality of post diagnostic care.  However, in younger age groups, Blacks have twice the CRC incidence rate as Whites, and their stage- adjusted CRC survival rates are lower than Whites. Assuming that most CRCs arise from precancerous polyps that evolve into cancer, it is plausible that Blacks experience earlier polyp initiation and more rapid polyp progression to cancer. If such is the case, one potential factor in the persistent CRC disparities may be the race-neutral age guideline for screening initiation. However there is no direct evidence regarding age-related Black-White differences in precancerous polyps and the indicators of progression through the intermediate stages (polyp size and dysplastic histology). To establish such evidence, it requires a data source representing the polyp prevalence and profile in the population. In the absence of a large enough autopsy study, the next best alternative is a colonoscopy series validated to have achieved near-complete polyp clearance, and having complete polyp documentation. No such data source has been available so far.  Our study will leverage a unique polyp database generated by a previous NIH-funded study. It represents the nearest possible proxy to the population polyp prevalence and profile, and has sufficient statistical power to compare Blacks and Whites on polyp prevalence and cancer-relevant features within age strata. It is a large and well-documented database of a single-center colonoscopy series which is externally validated to have achieved near-complete polyp clearance: this cohort experienced 83% CRC incidence reduction and 89% CRC mortality reduction relative to the general South Carolina population over a 4.9-year of follow-up period. The rates are similar to those of the only colonoscopy clinical trial so far.  We will use data on ~17,681 colonoscopy patients with ~32,900 polyps (54% Black), and CRC data on this cohort obtained from the South Carolina Central Cancer Registry. We will study Black-White differences within 5-10 year age strata in: the presence of polyps, polyp number and features (size, histology, anatomic location, dysplasia status, and cancer), as well as combinations of these factors. We will use univariate statistical tests, multiple regressio (binary and ordered polynomial logistic regression, linear and Poisson regression) and cluster analysis. We will use sensitivity analyses to account for potential bias in the sample. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) have remained unabated from pre-2000 levels despite significant strides in population-wide colonoscopy screening. Studies suggest the plausibility of earlier initiation and more rapid polyp progression to cancer among Blacks although direct evidence is lacking. This study will explore a unique dataset generated by a previous study to investigate this question and could potentially facilitate changes in the recommended screening age and frequency for Blacks with implications for reducing CRC racial disparities.",Reducing Colorectal Cancer Disparities: Racial Differences in Colorectal Polyp Profile,9195710,R21CA202477,"['adenoma ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Carpet ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gold ', ' Histology ', ' Hyperplastic ', ' Hyperplasia ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' Polynomial Models ', ' polynomials ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Polyps ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Tubular formation ', ' Tubular ', ' Morphology ', ' Dysplasia ', ' dyscrasia ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Frequencies ', ' Location ', ' Colorectal ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' Sampling ', ' Documentation ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Colorectal Polyp ', ' large intestine polyp ', ' large bowel polyp ', ' Colo-rectal Polyp ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Premalignant ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Villous ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' tv watching ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R21,2017,130070,0.26019843264406506
"Culturally Targeted Loss Framed Messaging for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Afri DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary African-Americans are at a substantially increased risk of both developing and dying from colorectal cancer (CRC). This costly disparity can be largely attributed to African-Americans' diminished use of available CRC screenings. Although early detection of CRC via screening is highly beneficial, efforts to encourage their use among African-Americans have not been successful, suggesting a critical need to develop and evaluate effective health messaging strategies. In turn, health communication research has advocated the use of both loss-framed messaging and also personal prevention messaging to encourage illness detection b behaviors. However, the capacity of these messaging strategies to encourage CRC screening among African-Americans is not well understood. This includes limited knowledge about the potential of such messages to interface with perceptions of racism and medical mistrust that can impede screening behavior, and also whether loss-framed and personal prevention messages can be simultaneously employed to better promote CRC screening among African-Americans. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop health communications that reduce significant and costly ethnic health disparities, and to reveal psychological processes that underlie effective health messaging for ethnic minorities. The immediate objective of this application is to identify how gain and loss-framed messaging, as well as personal prevention messaging, may be used to reduce CRC screening disparities among African-Americans. The central hypothesis is that African-Americans will be best compelled to obtain screening for CRC when messages simultaneously emphasize personal prevention and are loss-framed. The specific aims are to 1) identify and compare effects of stand-alone gain versus loss- framed health messaging on African-Americans' CRC screening attitudes, intentions, and behavior; 2) identify and compare effects of gain versus loss-framed health messaging on African-Americans' perceived racism and medical mistrust; 3) determine the effect of coupling gain and loss-framed messages with a culturally-targeted personal prevention message on African-Americans' CRC screening attitudes, intentions, and behavior. The proposed research will develop and administer for unique versions of a CRC informational and screening video communication. These videos will be used to experimentally evaluate the effects of stand-alone and coupled loss-framed and personal prevention health messages on CRC screening attitudes, intentions, and behavior in a local sample of African-Americans. The proposed research will also identify the effects of health messages on perceived racism and medical mistrust. The public health implications of this project are significant. Namely, the proposed research will provide knowledge that is critical for developing and evaluating useful approaches to ethnic minority health messaging, and for better understanding how best to encourage cancer detection behaviors among African-Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative The proposed research will evaluate how broad-spectrum and culture-specific health messaging strategies can be combined to better promote colorectal cancer screening among African-Americans. The proposed research carries important public health implications in proposing to identify health communications that reduce a significant and costly ethnic health disparity, and in examining psychological processes that underlie effective health messaging for ethnic minorities.",Culturally Targeted Loss Framed Messaging for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Afri,9275926,R01CA175088,"['Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Prevention ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Advocate ', ' Detection ', ' Health Communication ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Communication Research ', ' Process ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' public health relevance ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' screening ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,282940,0.2638926193310361
"Reducing Rural Colon Cancer Disparities Through Multi-Level Intervention On Follow-Up After Abnormal Screening Tests ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death in the US and many rural areas experience disparately high CRC mortality rates. In rural Southern Illinois, in particular, CRC mortality is persistently high despite state-wide and nation-wide declines. Routine screening can reduce mortality, but is most impactful when individuals who test positive receive a timely and complete diagnostic follow-up. Our long-term objective is to eliminate the CRC disparities in rural Southern Illinois. For many rural and safety-net health systems, including in Southern Illinois, fecal testing (FOBT) remains a common first-line strategy for CRC screening, and many do not receive timely and complete diagnostic follow-up. Our objective in the current application is to collaborate with a rural health system to implement and evaluate a multi-level intervention (patient, provider- staff, clinic) to improve follow-up of positive FOBTs. Based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and using a Stepped Wedge Research Design, our study will address both effectiveness and implementation outcomes. Our Specific Aims are: (Aim 1) Assess pre-implementation conditions to inform strategies that will maximize the likelihood of successful implementation of the multi-level intervention; (Aim 2) Evaluate the impact of a multi-level intervention addressing patient, provider-staff, and clinic-level factors to improve follow-up after positive FOBT; and (Aim 3) Evaluate moderation and mediation of multi-level intervention effects using mixed methods. To achieve this, we will conduct a pre-implementation evaluation of each clinic (n=23) and randomly assign sites to one of three clusters to receive the multi-level intervention in staggered intervals. We will estimate the intervention effect both within and between clusters using data collected by the healthcare organization including report of a positive FOBT result to the referring provider and the patient, initiation of colonoscopy after positive FOBT, and completion of colonoscopy after positive FOBT. Secondary outcomes are documentation of screening/surveillance interval after colonoscopy and time to colonoscopy after positive FOBT. Quantitative methods will be used to assess clinic-level mediators and moderators and patient-level moderators of the intervention effect. Qualitative methods will explore other potential moderators or mediators at the patient-, provider-staff-, clinic-levels that generate explanations of how and why the intervention worked for some but not others. The Stepped Wedge approach is particularly fitting for our research purposes because practical, logistical and financial reasons make it impossible to implement the intervention in half of all clusters simultaneously. Our innovative multi-level approach has been guided by implementation theory and developed in close partnership with a rural health system. The co-construction of this study and proposed intervention with rural healthcare stakeholders enhances the potential for significant and sustainable change. Twenty-percent of the US population live in rural areas, and there is a critical need for real-world interventions that can function in these predominantly underserved regions of the United States. Project Narrative This project is highly relevant to public health because it will provide new information about ways that primary care teams and health care clinics in rural areas can help patients complete colonoscopy after an abnormal screening for colorectal cancer.

"The Interplay of Behavior, Environment, and Microbiota in Colorectal Cancer Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Tiffany Carson is an applied epidemiologist with a background in studying health disparities of black and white women. Dr. Carson's early work focused on behaviors related to diet, physical activity, obesity and related health outcomes. Recently, Dr. Carson has focused on applying her research efforts to better understand cancer disparities of black and white women. Dr. Carson's overarching career goal is to become an independently funded investigator and develop evidence-based bio-behavioral interventions to reduce cancer health disparities. To that end, this application proposes a rigorous research project and training plan focused on investigating the microbiota as a novel potential contributor to colorectal cancer (CRC) disparities between black and white women. CRC is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the United States    accounting for 9% of cancer deaths. Known risk factors for CRC include increasing age, male sex, family history, inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical inactivity, high consumption of red and processed meats and high fat diet, and obesity. Among women, even after accounting for differences in the distribution of risk factors, black women remain at 48% greater risk for CRC than white women. There is a growing body of research suggesting that the influence of diet on CRC risk is mediated through the microbiota and that microbial perturbations caused by diet, lifestyle, and antibiotics can lead to increased risk for CRC and other chronic diseases. Stress is one factor that has been shown to lead to alterations in the microbiota. Our research has shown that black women report moderate to high stress levels and additional published literature indicates that black women report higher stress levels than their white counterparts. These observations have lead to our hypothesis that a greater proportion of black women have a perturbed microbiota as a result of higher stress levels compared to white women, putting black women at greater risk for developing CRC. In the present proposal, we plan to explore this hypothesis employing a case control study design comparing the following groups: 1) black and white women with incident CRC from the Kirklin Clinic at UAB and 2) age-matched cancer-free black and white female community controls. Specifically, we will first characterize the oral and gut microbiota of black and white women with CRC and compare by race with particular focus on microbes known to be either positively or negatively associated with CRC. Because all cases will have CRC, we hypothesize that there will be no significant racial differences in the microbiota or other known risk factors for CRC such as diet. In contrast, when we repeat this experiment in cancer-free black and white female community controls, we expect to observe racial differences in the microbiota, with black women having less health-promoting bacteria and more pathogenic bacteria than white women, which would put black women at increased risk for CRC. We anticipate that a greater proportion of black females in the control group will have microbiota that resembles the microbiota of participants with CRC. Additionally, if our hypothesis is supported, psychological stress with be inversely associated with health-promoting bacteria and positively associated with pathogenic bacteria. Our findings will provide insight into how lifestyle factors that have not been fully explored to date such as stress may be associated with risk for CRC as a result of how stress perturbs the microbiota. If we determine that stress contributes to CRC risk via microbial perturbations, future bio-behavioral interventions that incorporate stress management and dietary/supplemental recommendations to promote mucosal health, and therefore reduce CRC risk, can be developed and implemented which could lead to diminished health care costs related to diagnosis and treatment and reduce CRC disparities between black and white women. In addition to providing valuable data, the proposed research project will also provide the opportunity for the additional training needed for Dr. Carson's development as an independently funded bio-behavioral cancer disparities researcher. Dr. Carson will engage in an intensive, structured training experience to develop expertise by completing the following: 1) Training in the recruitment of racially diverse clinical and community populations for bio-specimen and bio-banking research, 2) Obtaining hands-on and didactic training in bioinformatics techniques, and 3) Improving professional skills such as team science, networking, grant writing, mentoring, and high-impact publications. Under the guidance of an esteemed panel of mentors and collaborators and the high quality research and training environment that the University of Alabama at Birmingham offers, Dr. Carson's research and training experiences will make a significant contribution to the scientific community and Dr. Carson's overall career development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the USA, and the disparity between black and white women remains unexplained. This study will evaluate novel biological, behavioral and environmental factors that may contribute to this disparity. Findings from this study will provide insight into whether stress and the microbiot contribute to risk for CRC and possibly lead to innovative interventions to reduce CRC incidence and disparities.","The Interplay of Behavior, Environment, and Microbiota in Colorectal Cancer Risk",9328031,K01CA190559,"['Accounting ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Alabama ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', '

"Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions to Improve Screening Among Rural Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2014 approximately 310,030 women in the United States (U.S.) will be diagnosed with breast cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CC), or colorectal cancer (CRC), and 68,060 women will die from these cancers. These three cancers account for 39% of the cancer burden and 25% of the cancer mortality among women in the U.S. Although effective screening tests are widely available for all three cancers, many women do not adhere to screening guidelines. Furthermore, the burden of these cancers is higher among some population groups and regions. Thirty-two rural counties in northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana share similar socioeconomically underserved populations of predominately (96.2%) white women who have elevated BC, CRC, and CC mortality rates, and lower screening rates with mammography, Pap tests, and fecal occult blood testing or colonoscopy. No known intervention has addressed improving screening rates for these three main female cancers simultaneously, even though multiple health behavior change research is emerging as a new model to change the way in which interventions can be packaged. The proposed project uses an overall theoretical framework to understand health disparities which includes individual, social and community level variables, and a conceptual model for the intervention which uses a multiple behavior theoretical approach, all of which have demonstrated efficacy in improving adherence to single screening test behaviors, as well as other preventive health behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to test the comparative effectiveness of a tailored interactive computer program delivered via DVD (TIDVD) vs. a TIDVD + telephone-based patient navigation (PN) intervention (TNI) vs. Usual Care (UC) to increase guideline-based screening rates for BC, CC, and CRC among women age 50 to 74 living in these rural counties of Ohio and Indiana. Specific aims are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of a tailored and interactive DVD (TIDVD) vs. TIDVD + telephone-based PN intervention (TNI) vs. UC, to increase guideline-based cancer screening rates at 12 months post randomization for BC, CC, and CRC among 1058 women age 50 to 74 living in rural northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana; and 2) compare the cost effectiveness of the TIDVD and the TIDVD + TNI intervention vs. UC, for adherence to each screening outcome or combination of screening tests. As an Exploratory Aim, we will identify associations between theoretical variables (community, social, and individual) and screening outcomes, including interactions with the interventions. If found to be cost effective, either or both interventions hae the potential to be immediately disseminated to increase BC, CC, and CRC screening rates and ultimately reduce cancer disparities for underserved rural women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Breast cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CC), and colorectal cancer (CRC) account for 39% of the cancer burden and 25% of the cancer mortality among women in the United States (U.S.). Although effective screening tests are widely available for all three cancers, many women do not adhere to screening guidelines. Thirty-two rural counties in northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana share similar socioeconomically underserved populations of predominately white women who have elevated mortality rates and lower screening rates for these cancers. The goal of this proposal is to test the comparative effectiveness of a tailored interactive computer program delivered via DVD (TIDVD) vs. a TIDVD + telephone-based patient navigation (PN) intervention (TNI) vs Usual Care (UC) to increase guideline-based screening rates for BC, CC, and CRC among women age 50 to 74 living in these rural counties of Ohio and Indiana.

"Community Based Prevention Marketing for Systems Change: Reducing Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a Prevention Research Center that uses community-based prevention marketing (CBPM) to adapt, implement, evaluate, and disseminate evidence-based approaches to strengthen state and local health departments' and community coalitions' capacity for sustained disease prevention and health promotion. The FPRC's health priority will be the reduction of cancer disparities, and the core research project for the next five years will focus on the promotion of colorectal cancer screening (CRCS). The FPRC's mission and core research are responsive to the Guide to Community Preventive Services' focus on multilevel interventions to increase screening for cancer. The core research project will focus on colorectal cancer (CRC), selected by our State partner - the Florida Department of Health (FDOH), because it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women in the U.S. While scientific cancer advances are occurring, racial ethnic minorities and the medically underserved have consistently experienced the highest CRC mortality rates. The aims of the core research project are to: 1) examine disparities in late stage colorectal cancer incidence and screening rates to identify priority populations; 2) identify appropriate and feasible evidence-based interventions (EBI) for the priority populations; 3) conduct formative research with priority populations and key stakeholders to assess the EBIs' acceptability and to tailor EBIs to better meet priority population(s)' preferences and needs; and 4) implement and evaluate the multilevel intervention and make recommendations for future programs and policies in the state of Florida. This proposal makes three significant contributions to prevention research. First, the FPRC will work with FDOH, a community committee and other stakeholders (e.g., American Cancer Society) to test the CBPM for Systems Change framework's ability to select, tailor, promote, monitor, evaluate, and disseminate EBIs to reduce colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) health disparities. This planning framework has the potential to equip prevention researchers, health department and community partners with an effective planning framework that accelerates the translation of research to practice. Lessons learned from this demonstration project will be used to enhance the FPRC's training website and provide technical assistance to other State health departments and community partners. Second, the FPRC and its partners will create a computer simulation model of the system in which CRCS disparities are embedded and identify evidence-based interventions appropriate for addressing determinants at multiple levels in that system. This model and formative research results will be used to design an integrated, multilevel intervention for reducing CRC disparities. The intervention will be evaluated and the feasibility of scaling it up to other communities assessed. A dissemination plan will be created for effective components. Third, the FPRC will use lessons learned from the new and previous demonstration projects to enhance the CBPM training website and mentor other public health agencies and community partners that adopt it.                  Project Narrative The Florida Prevention Research Center (FPRC) uses community-based prevention marketing (CBPM) for systems change to develop, adapt, implement, evaluate, and disseminate evidence-based approaches to strengthen state and local health departments' and community coalitions' capacity for sustained disease prevention and health promotion.

"Variations in Needs after Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Survivorship after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer, the third most common cancer in men and women, has many challenges. Research has shown that colorectal cancer survivors have unmet needs and worse physical and mental quality of life compared to individuals without cancer. Medically underserved populations are known risk groups for poor survivorship care, poor quality of survival, and poor quality of life after colorecal cancer. Sexual minority populations are medically underserved, according to a recent Institute of Medicine Report, yet at present their survivorship care and their quality of life after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer is unknown. The proposed study will determine whether disparities linked to sexual orientation exist in colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life. We will obtain a population-based sample of colorectal cancer survivors who differ by sexual orientation, applying our previously tested recruitment method, which uses cancer registry data from geographic areas with an above average density of sexual minority individuals. After collecting survey data on health care and quality of life, from heterosexual and sexual minority survivors, we will test three study hypotheses: 1) Sexual minority survivors will have poorer quality health care compared to heterosexual survivors, even after controlling for disease and non-disease factors. 2) Heterosexual survivors' quality of life will be better than sexual minority survivors' quality of life, even after controlling for disease and non-disease factors and quality health care. And 3) Sexual minority survivors who are at ease with their sexual minority identity will have better quality health care and quality of life than sexual minorty survivors who have difficulty with their identity. This study will be the first to comprehensively examine sexual minority colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life, illuminating the mechanisms that influence health care and quality of life. The findings will consist of modifiable and non-modifiable factors associated with sexual minority and heterosexual colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life. Researchers, health care providers, and policy makers can then intervene to address the modifiable factors identified by this study to facilitate improvement in diverse colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life. Thi research is critically needed to realize the Institute of Medicine's goals of improving survivorshi in this special population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this study will provide information about the quality health care and the quality of life of colorectal cancers survivors of different sexual orientations. From the individual interviews with lesbian, gay, and bisexual survivors of colorectal cancer, we will derive salient factors to be included in our survey questionnaire. Using quantitative survey data obtained from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual survivors of colorectal cancers, who were recruited from three cancer registries, we will determine whether there are disparities by sexual orientation in colorectal cancer survivor's quality health care and quality of life. Ultimately, this population-based approach to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual colorectal cancer survivorship is a necessary step on which we expect to build with follow-up research that will use the findings of this study for the development and testing of interventions to improve the needs of lesbian, gay, and bisexual colorectal cancer survivors.",Variations in Needs after Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis,9302696,R01CA181392,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Buffers ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' experience ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' Reporting ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' Sampling ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' data registry ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobia ', ' Homophobic ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,590334,0.06789680106115636
"A patient-centered intervention using virtual technology to reduce colorectal cancer disparities in primary care PROJECT ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Unfortunately, there are significant CRC screening disparities that result in higher rates of CRC-related morbidity and mortality for minority and rural patient populations, particularly in the southern United States. The development of interventions that capitalize on advances in communication, informatics, and computer science have great promise for resolving theoretical and practical problems associated with CRC screening decision-making. The purpose of this proposal is to test the efficacy of a patient-centered, tailored message intervention delivered via virtual technology for increasing CRC screening within guidelines among racial/ethnic minority and rural patients. We hypothesize that exposure to a minimally tailored CRC screening intervention delivered via VHT will lead to improved cognitive processing of the intervention and increased adherence with initial and repeated annual FIT screening completion as compared to a fully tailored, text-only intervention. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct focus groups and think-aloud interviews stratified by geography, gender, and racial/ethnic background to expand and pilot test an intervention that uses a virtual human as a delivery mechanism for CRC screening information. In Specific Aim 2, patients (N = 3,000) will be recruited via primary care clinics and a secure, clinical data warehouse to complete a patient- randomized test of the efficacy of the intervention for promoting initial and repeat FIT testing. Dependent measures will be assessed via patient self-report and chart review. The proposed study will reduce health disparities and associated morbidity and mortality due to CRC via increasing screening among racial/ethnic minority and rural populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE A primary goal of Healthy People 2020 is to increase the percentage of individuals screened for colorectal cancer (CRC) across population subgroups to 80%.

"Strategies and Opportunities to Stop Colon Cancer in Priority Populations DESCRIPTION: The federal government has set a Healthy People 2020 goal of a 70.5% screening rate for colorectal cancer (CRC), but almost half of eligible U.S. adults are not up to date on their screenings. Among minority and low-income populations, the CRC screening rate is extremely low. To address this disparity, we will develop and test a culturally tailored, health care system-based program to improve CRC screening rates in OCHIN, a community-based collaborative network of more than 200 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). Racial and ethnic minorities, along with low-income and medically underserved populations, increasingly receive their primary care at FQHCs, which serve nearly 19 million patients annually throughout the United States. OCHIN is the largest national FQHC network. Its integrated electronic health record system combining medical, laboratory, and claims data will serve as a novel and robust data source for our study. In Phase I (Year 01), we will pilot-test an evidence-based approach to improving participation in CRC screening in two OCHIN FQHCs. This phase will include an assessment of the intervention s feasibility, effectiveness, and cost. In Phase II (Years 02 05), we will conduct a comparative effectiveness pragmatic clinical trial, using a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of our CRC screening program designed explicitly for FQHC clinics. Throughout the project, we will work with a diverse planning advisory group of OCHIN clinicians and patients, community representatives, state policy makers, and researchers, using principles of Community-Based Participatory Research. Because OCHIN is the largest single FQHC network and serves patients who are diverse in race, ethnicity, and insurance status, our results will play a transformative role in accelerating CRC screening research in underserved populations. Our program will expand meaningful use of electronic health information; synergistically meet national goals to improve cancer screening rates, address health disparities, and reduce health care costs; and act as a catalyst for future systems-based approaches to improve care delivery in FQHCs and other health systems.

"Wired for Colorectal Cancer Screening: An mHealth Intervention 7. ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Medically underserved populations experience a disproportionate burden of CRC mortality. Fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is a simple, easy to do, and widely accessible screening modality that helps to diminish CRC mortality disparities. The effectiveness of FOBT to reduce CRC mortality depends heavily on adherence to annual testing. Unfortunately, repeat FOBT screening ranges from 14% to 44%. A novel approach to encourage repeat annual FOBT is a technology-driven low cost mobile health (mHealth) educational intervention. mHealth interventions have been shown to lead to behavior change in a variety diseases; however its use to facilitate annual CRC screening (CRCS) with FOBT has not been studied. There is a timely opportunity to promote repeat annual FOBT screening in an existing cohort of medically underserved men and women enrolled in a trial to increase initial uptake of fecal immunochemical test (FIT), a type of FOBT, at community based clinics. Assessment of repeat FIT is beyond the scope of the parent trial, but repeat FIT uptake is expected to be low. The subject of this application is to explore the efficacy of an innovative, low cost, educational, evidence-based and theory-based mHealth intervention to promote adherence to annual FIT in a medically underserved population. During Phase I, a series of educational, targeted, and actionable mHealth messages will be developed and refined. This will be achieved by iterative focus groups and mobile technology testing and troubleshooting with (n=35) patients seen in community clinics. During Phase II, the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the Wired for CRCS intervention to educate and prompt patients to repeat CRCS with FIT will be assessed. To achieve this, 120 members of the existing cohort of men and women who are not up to date on annual FIT will be recruited and randomized to the Wired for CRCS intervention arm or usual care arm. Those randomized to the Wired for CRCS intervention will receive a series of educational, targeted, and actionable messages (refined during Phase I) on their cell phone. FIT uptake will be assessed four months after baseline. It is expected that the Wired for CRCS intervention will result in greater FIT uptake compared to usual care. Successful completion of this research will provide preliminary information on feasibility, acceptability, efficacy, usability and utility of a technology solution for promoting repeat annual FIT in a diverse sample of patients at community clinics. With this evidence, the team will be poised for a larger trial expected to provide a more definitive test of educational mHealth interventions on adherence to CRCS with annual FIT. 8. NARRATIVE Annual fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) may help to diminish disparities in CRC mortality. Successful completion of this pilot trial will provide preliminary evidence for a larger trial to determine the impact of an educational mobile health (mHealth) intervention on adherence to CRC screening with an annual fecal immunochemical test, a type of FOBT. Ultimately, if an educational mHealth intervention is found to promote adherence to CRC screening, it could be applied widely in other community-based settings and in other cancer sites where beneficial screenings and other established biomedical interventions are underutilized.",Wired for Colorectal Cancer Screening: An mHealth Intervention,9335803,R03CA198580,"['Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' literacy ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Uninsured ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' cancer site ', ' cancer location ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' usability ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' trial design ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' ']",NCI,RBHS-SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R03,2017,80489,0.18708112423785195
"Culturally Adapted Multilevel Decision Support Navigation Trial to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Disparity among At-Risk Asian American Primary Care Patients PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans, and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) is ranked as the second most common in cancer deaths among Asian Americans. However, recent data show that CRC screening rates are substantially lower for Chinese and Korean Americans (CKAs) compared with other racial/ethnic groups. To date, a small number of community-based studies have reported on the use of single level (participant level only) interventions to increase CRC screening rates among CKAs; however, very little is known about the impact of multi-level (patient-oriented and provider-oriented) interventions on CRC screening adherence among CKA patients in primary care setting. Furthermore, our preliminary data indicate physician's recommendation as the strongest facilitator of CRC screening among CKAs. Thus, the primary objective of the study is to address this important knowledge gap by conducting a randomized controlled trial to determine the impact of a multi-level culturally-sensitive decision support intervention on CRC screening adherence among 400 CKA primary care patients. Previous studies found that facilitating patient decision-making through decision support and providing patient navigation can increase CRC screening among diverse primary care patients. We will culturally adapt existing evidence- based decision support navigation intervention (CA-DSNI) and test its efficacy among 200 CKA men and 200 CKA women aged 50 to 75 eligible for CRC screening. We will recruit the participants from primary care physicians (PCPs) clinics. The study is designed to compare CRC screening outcomes between the CA-DSNI and the Advanced Control (AC). Those randomized to the AC will receive an informational booklet, a stool blood test kit and a reminder by mail. Those randomized to the CA-DSNI will receive everything the AC receives. Additionally, we will provide decision support and navigation contacts to participants, develop an individualized screening plan using a theory-based online Decision Counseling Program, share the plan with the participants' PCPs, and have PCPs to encourage the screening to participants. Using outcomes data collected by survey and medical record review, we will: (1) determine overall CRC screening adherence in the CA-DSNI vs. the AC; (2) measure change in CRC screening decision stage in the CA-DSNI vs. the AC; and (3) Assess CRC screening test-specific (stool blood test vs. colonoscopy) adherence in the CA-DSNI vs. the AC. Additionally, we will evaluate intervention reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance using interview data. IMPACT: This study represents the first instance in which CA-DSNI will be used with CKAs in primary care practice settings to address a significant cancer disparity. With growing need for linguistically and culturally competent care, more decision support, language facilitation, and navigation efforts may come into care settings. Therefore, having tested interventions ready for the target population will be timely, and medical systems may benefit from having multilevel best practices known and tested for CKAs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans, but colorectal cancer screening rate remains low in this population. The goal of this R01 award application is to increase colorectal cancer screening among underserved Chinese and Korean Americans through cultural adaptation and implementation of a decision support navigation trial provided in primary care setting.

"Novel randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in patients with colorectal cancer: Impact on survival and biology PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Abundant preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that vitamin D possesses anti-neoplastic activity, and that individuals with higher plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels have lower risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and improved survival from CRC. Despite compelling evidence implicating vitamin D in CRC, critical questions remain about whether these findings reflect a true causal relationship, and what the biological mech- anisms of vitamin D activity are. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation to achieve sufficient levels of 25(OH)D leads to improved survival in CRC patients and influences several neoplastic pathways that can be exploited as biomarkers of efficacy and targets for novel treatment strategies. We will test this hypothe- sis within two novel randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation: a) a phase II double-blind random- ized trial of high- versus low-dose vitamin D3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic CRC, and b) a randomized trial of preoperative high-dose vitamin D3 versus placebo in patients with resectable colon cancer for examination of vitamin D biology in fresh human tumor tissue. We will also lever- age a rich prospective cohort of metastatic CRC patients enrolled in a completed NCI-sponsored phase III trial of chemotherapy (CALGB/SWOG 80405) to further define and validate biomarkers of vitamin D action. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of supplemental vitamin D on survival of CRC patients, test distinct hypotheses about the vitamin D dose-response relationship, and explore biomarkers of vitamin D status, response, and efficacy. We will investigate whether circulating levels of vitamin D binding protein and tumoral expression of vitamin D receptor, 1α-hydroxylase, and 24-hydroxylase are associated with improved survival within our ran- domized trials, and whether these markers modify the relationship between vitamin D and patient outcome. In Aim 2, we will conduct a precision medicine analysis of vitamin D to elucidate the mechanistic basis for its anti- tumor activity in CRC. We will explore the impact of vitamin D supplementation on tumoral markers of inflam- mation, lymphocytic infiltrates, and inflammatory gene signatures in surgical colectomy specimens from pa- tients treated with high-dose preoperative vitamin D3 versus placebo. We will also perform next generation se- quencing and Nanostring analysis of tumors from CRC patients with high- versus low vitamin D status to identi- fy unique genetic and transcriptional signatures associated with vitamin D-mediated carcinogenesis. In sum- mary, this translational proposal leverages innovative randomized trials of vitamin D to take the next critical steps in understanding vitamin D activity and biology in CRC. Our findings will confirm causality, provide new insights into biomarkers of vitamin D activity, and lead to potential inclusion of vitamin D into standard therapy – including immunotherapy – with the ultimate goal of improving the survival of patients with CRC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S., and may plausibly be linked to vitamin D deficiency. Abundant preclinical and epide- miologic data link lower levels of vitamin D to increased risk of and mortality from colorectal cancer; this is par- ticularly relevant given increasing rates of vitamin D deficiency in the U.S., as well as profound racial disparities in vitamin D status and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. In an era of expensive and often toxic anti- neoplastic drugs, vitamin D therefore represents an attractive and accessible treatment option for patients of all races and sociodemographic groups with respect to both safety and cost.",Novel randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in patients with colorectal cancer: Impact on survival and biology,9311171,R01CA205406,"['Affect ', '

"Internet-based Motivational Interviewing for Colonoscopy in African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to other racial groups, African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) morbidity and mortality rates. Although colonoscopies can prevent CRC, nearly half of African Americans (40.2%) have not received a screening colonoscopy within the recommended time frame (one colonoscopy per ten years). It is critical to increase African Americans' screening colonoscopy rates in order to reduce racial inequities in CRC morbidity and mortality. Dr. Miller's pilot work, as well as the current literature, suggest that an Internet-based Motivational Interviewing Intervention for Colonoscopy (I-MIIC) may help improve African Americans' screening colonoscopy uptake. The proposed project will first field-test the intervention, using an iterative approach, with African Americans referred for a screening colonoscopy (N=40). The field-testing results will guide the development, revisions, and finalization of the I-MIIC. Then, a randomized clinical trial will examine the efficacy of the -MIIC for improving African Americans' screening colonoscopy uptake. Participants (N=200) will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (N=100) in which they engage in a 20-minute I-MIIC intervention or a control group (N=100) in which they review a print brochure on CRC screening. The results will contribute to the growing literature on CRC disparities. Dr. Sarah Miller is the ideal candidate to spearhead this line of research given her academic and clinical background in CRC disparities and motivational interviewing. Dr. Miller's long-term goal is to become an independent researcher with expertise in the early detection and prevention of cancer in racial/ethnic minorities. To achieve her goals, as part of the K07, Dr. Miller will receie intensive training in four areas: 1) qualitative research; 2) e-Health; 3) longitudinal data analyss, and 4) professional development. The K07 will provide Dr. Miller with a variety of avenues to achieve her training goals and enhance her expertise. In particular, Dr. Miller will have ongoing meetings with seasoned mentors as well as participate in formal coursework, workshops, conferences, and interactive trainings. The proposed K07 will form the foundation for a program of research that focuses on improving cancer screening uptake in racial/ethnic minorities with the goal of reducing disparities. At the end of the K07 funding period, Dr. Miller will submit an R01 application, based on the results of the present study. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) is the ideal environment for Dr. Miller to complete her proposed research project and training. In particular, the ISMMS can offer Dr. Miller: 1) the resources necessary to complete her research; 2) access to multiple training activities; and 3) access to a diverse patient population. Most importantly, Dr. Miller will receive guidance from a team of superior mentors with expertise in: CRC disparities, qualitative research, biostatistics, e-Health, and primary care. The mentoring team will work closely with Dr. Miller to ensure that she achieves her research and training objectives. Overall, the K07 will provide Dr. Miller with the research experience, intensive training, and mentorship needed to become a successful independent researcher. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research has significant public health relevance. The development of an Internet-based motivational interviewing intervention for colonoscopy (I-MIIC) to increase African Americans' screening colonoscopy uptake will help to reduce disparities in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates. If the I- MIIC proves efficacious, there is a strong argument to replicate this intervention with other vulnerable populations and with other cancer tests.",Internet-based Motivational Interviewing for Colonoscopy in African Americans,9323353,K07CA190726,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Appointment ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Control Groups ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Intestines ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Polyps ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Seasons ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer prevention ', ' CRC prevention ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' programs ', ' Test Result ', ' meetings ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Participant ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Reporting ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Preventive ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Premalignant ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Preparation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Cancerous ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' patient population ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' attentional control ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K07,2017,170640,0.23616207167541448
"Vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk: an integrated molecular and genetic epidemiologic study PROJECT ABSTRACT This K99/R00 Career Development Award will provide the applicant, Dr. Warren Andersen, with the research experience and training to propel her into a career as an independent investigator in the field of genetic and molecular epidemiology with a focus on the interplay between race, modifiable risk factors, and the genetic determinants of cancer risk and outcomes. The research plan uses Mendelian randomization methods to evaluate the hypothesis that circulating and bioavailable vitamin D levels are associated with decreased colorectal cancer risk. Mendelian randomization (MR) methods can be used to evaluate the associations between long-term exposures and diseases by using genetic variants as instrumental variables in place of exposures. Dr. Warren Andersen will also assess whether vitamin D binding protein modifies the association between vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk. The project will leverage resources from three established epidemiologic consortia (the ColoRectal Transdisciplinary Study (CORECT) consortium, a colorectal cancer genome-wide association study consortium among African Americans, and the Asia Colorectal Cancer Consortium) and the Southern Community Cohort Study to evaluate associations in large samples including individuals of European, Asian and African descent. Dr. Warren Andersen will create race-specific genetic scores to represent circulating vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein. Fine-mapping will be conducted to identify potentially causal variants to be included in the vitamin D genetic scores. These genetic scores will then be assessed for associations with overall colorectal cancer risk, and colorectal cancer risk stratified by specific characteristics of the tumor such as COX-2 expression, PIK3CA mutation status, and stage. During the Career Development Award Dr. Warren Andersen will gain additional skills in genetic analysis and increase her knowledge in colorectal cancer biology and health disparities. The findings from this research project will be used to develop and submit two R01 level projects before the completion of the Career Development Award. The additional experience gained from this Career Development Award will prepare Dr. Warren Andersen to be a leader in the field of genetic and molecular epidemiology of cancer, with expertise in colorectal cancer etiology, genetic and cancer epidemiology, and the root causes of racial differences in disease risk. This research topic is of much significance, as the Institute of Medicine's 2010 Report stated, investigation into the causal relationships between vitamin D and total and site-specific cancers is an important research need. The use of MR and molecular epidemiologic methods should provide a more definitive answer to the questions of the relationships of colorectal cancer risk with circulating vitamin D, bioavailable vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein. This study will provide insight into colorectal cancer etiology and potentially identify subgroups of individuals who may benefit the most from vitamin D supplementation. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to conduct a large molecular epidemiologic study using fine-mapping and Mendelian randomization methods in Whites, Asians, and African Americans to provide more definitive evidence regarding the association of circulating vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein with colorectal cancer risk. We will further study tumor markers to investigate possible mechanisms for the associations. This study will improve our understanding of colorectal cancer etiology and provide valuable data for designing cost-efficient measures to reduce the risk of this common malignancy.",Vitamin D and

"Transdisciplinary Team Science in Colorectal Cancer Prognosis: the ColoCare Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer will affect one in 20 individuals over the course of their lifetime. The ColoCare Study is a prospective cohort of men and women newly diagnosed with a first primary invasive colorectal cancer (stage I-IV) with repeat data and biospecimen collection beginning prior to surgery. The ColoCare Study was initiated at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center with subsequent consortium sites at the Moffitt Cancer Center, the German Cancer Research Center, and Huntsman Cancer Institute with institutional pilot/start-up funding to support patient recruitment. The goal of this study is to uniformly collet comprehensive sets of data and biospecimens from over 4000 multiethnic colorectal cancer patients at multiple time points (prior to surgery and 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post-surgery), including detailed treatment and risk factor data, fresh and fixed tumor and normal tissue, visceral adipose tissue, blood, stool, urine, saliva, and quantitative accelerometry data t assess physical activity. Each ColoCare Study site leverages existing infrastructure, including access to electronic medical records and NCI comprehensive/designated cancer center cores, while utilizing well-established protocols for recruitment, data collection, and biospecimen ascertainment that are consistently applied across all sites. Patients are followed up both actively and passively by study staff (in-person and through medical record reviews), as well as via linkages to cancer registry and vital status records. Currently, using pilot/institutional fund at four existing sites, we have recruited >1100 patients (n=1010 baseline bloods). With this infrastructure grant, we propose 1) to extend the ColoCare consortium to two new study centers that will enrich our numbers of underrepresented minority participants (University of Southern California, LA, and Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis) and 2) to continue and expand study procedures at all US sites, including energy balance assessments and molecular characterization of tumors. The support for expanded enrollment and continued follow-up of the ColoCare cohort will result in an estimated 4167 highly characterized enrollees. The repeat sampling of data and a diverse set of accompanying biospecimens at critical time points enables unprecedented epidemiologic and biomarker research that can inform clinical decision making and support evidence-based guidelines regarding lifestyle changes that impact outcomes. Additionally, we will establish an external advisory board and a community/participant advisory board to further guide infrastructure development and prioritize research use of this cohort. We will continue to participate in national and international consorti by contributing data and biospecimens. Support for this unique cohort of colorectal cancer patients will create a valuable resource for the broader research community. In-depth, repeated phenotyping within a single cohort will enable one-of-a-kind studies focused on the effects of health behaviors on prognosis, as well as the discovery of new biomarkers of clinically important outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    We propose to continue building and expanding the ColoCare Study, the only existing cohort of colorectal cancer patients for whom clinical data, information on health behaviors, and universal biospecimens have been systematically collected at repeat time points; ColoCare is uniquely suited for the discovery of new biomarkers of colorectal cancer treatment response and prognosis, as well as research that elucidates the influence of health behaviors on treatment efficacy and toxicity, quality-of-life, recurrence, and survival. We propose here to continue and augment collections at existing ColoCare sites, expand to two new sites that will focus on the recruitment of ethnic/racial minorities (over 4000 participants), and perform molecular characterization of tumor samples. This unique, multiethnic cohort will be an incredible resource for the broader research community, given its suitability for a wide-range of studies with potentially significant and near-term clinical

"Enhancing Prevention Pathways Towards Tribal Colorectal Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) experience significant health inequities and disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) related incidence, mortality, stage at diagnosis, and survival. Recent reductions in CRC incidence and mortality rates and improvements in stage at diagnosis and survival rates in the general U.S. population have been attributed to routine screening with prompt removal of polyps, early detection, and timely and appropriate treatment. AI/ANs are significantly less likely than non-Hispanic Whites to receive timely and risk- and age-appropriate cancer screenings, including recommended CRC screening. The short-term goal is to test the efficacy of serially implemented interventions designed to enhance annual CRC screening using the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Serial implementation refers to offering routine screening, irrespective of response to an earlier invitation, in concordance with national guidelines which recommend annual FIT testing between ages 50-75. The FIT is most appropriate because, based on consensus guidelines, it is an approved, high sensitivity fecal occult blood test that is offered annually and is available in Indian Health Service and tribal health facilities where resources to provide screening colonoscopy are limited. We will follow all positive FIT results with timely and appropriate diagnostic and treatment services. We address screening disparities through the testing of interventions designed to enhance annual CRC screening using the FIT among average- risk, on-reservation AIs aged 50-75 in the rural Southwest. The interventions are theory-informed, evidence- based, and graded in their intensity. The high intensity intervention will include navigated outreach, a mailed FIT kit, educational material, and follow-up reminders (Study Group 1). The medium intensity intervention will include a mailed FIT kit, educational material, and follow-up reminders (Study Group 2). The reference group (Study Group 3) will receive usual care (screening recommendation and a FIT kit at a clinic visit). We will use rigorous research methods to: (a) determine the efficacy of interventions to enhance annual CRC screening through completion of the FIT kit; (b) understand contextually relevant factors important for behavior change; (c) identify the most cost-effective strategies to enhance routine CRC screening; and (d) develop plans to inform sustainability and scalability. This is a collaborative effort between the University of New Mexico, the Albuquerque Area Indian Health Board (100% Indian-owned and operated), and six Pueblo Tribes in the rural Southwest. The research team has an extensive and successful history of conducting community based participatory cancer prevention research in collaboration with AI communities. Moreover, the research team recognizes the value of integrating a co-learning process and engaging in trust-based mutually beneficial research. Findings from this research could lead to an immediate increase in CRC screening and ultimately reduce the CRC disease burden among AIs experiencing cancer disparities and health inequities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age- and risk-appropriate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening coupled with prompt removal of polyps, early detection, and timely and appropriate treatment can reduce CRC incidence and mortality, detect and diagnose CRC at an earlier stage, and improve survival. However, American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have not benefitted equally from these gains in CRC control. To the best of our knowledge, no research has tested, with scientific and methodological rigor, strategies to enhance CRC screening among AIs. Documenting the efficacy of serially implemented CRC interventions designed to enhance the annual uptake of CRC screening tests among AIs can lead to broad implementation of evidence-based CRC screening interventions that could ultimately address the national and tribal priority of reducing CRC disparities among AIs.",Enhancing Prevention Pathways Towards Tribal Colorectal Health,9247763,R01CA192967,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Priorities ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Physician Executives ', ' Medical Directors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' New Mexico ', ' Polyps ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Indian Health Service ', ' United States Indian Health Service ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' Rural ', ' Program Sustainabilities ', ' Program Sustainability ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Consensus ', ' Test Result ', ' behavior change ', ' Colorectal ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Indian reservation ', ' tribal reservation ', ' reservation community ', ' native american reservation ', ' nation reservation ', ' American Indian reservation ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Address ', ' tribal health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Reservations ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Pueblo ', ' Pueblo Race ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Coupled ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' efficacy testing ', ' health equity ', ' arm ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' trial design ', ' rural Americans ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,R01,2017,558335,0.2943049524030131
"Using Context to Improve Implementation of Evidenced-based Interventions for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Rural Primary Care (Precise CRC) PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Melinda Davis has a PhD in social developmental psychology and is a Research Assistant Professor in the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) School of Medicine (Department of Family Medicine) and Assistant Professor in the OHSU-PSU School of Public Health (Health Behavior). She is the Director of Community Engaged Research for the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN) at OHSU. This K07 builds upon her applied experience as a practice facilitator and participatory researcher, addresses critical gaps in scientific training, and provides pilot data for an R01 submission in year 3 in response to PAR-16-238. Guided by a multidisciplinary team of mentors, Dr. Davis will, through this K07, consolidate her skills in implementation science, mixed-methods, and cancer prevention and control. She will also secure her transition to research independence. Research Focus: Bridging the gap between knowledge of evidence based interventions (EBIs) and application in “real world” settings is a critical issue in cancer prevention and control research. Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, yet disparities exist for rural and low-income populations. Although direct mail (DM) programs can increase CRC screening rates by nearly 40%, this EBI is not yet routine practice. Moreover, implementation and intervention outcomes vary widely across settings. Research is needed to inform how best to scale DM programs and to support follow-up colonoscopy on positive fecal tests. Guided by the social ecological model and consolidated framework for implementation research we propose three aims:  Aim 1: Identify factors associated with higher levels of primary care practice readiness to implement direct  mail programs to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.  H1: Leadership culture and higher levels of adaptive reserve will be associated with readiness.  Aim 2: Pilot test tailored implementation support for a direct mail program in four rural primary care  practices clustered in one Medicaid Accountable Care Organization (ACO).  Aim 3: Elucidate barriers, facilitators, and adaptations to direct mail program components and the  associated impact on implementation and intervention outcomes. Training Goals: The training proposed fills critical gaps to enable Dr. Davis to conduct trials to improve the identification, adaptation, and implementation of EBIs to improve cancer prevention in rural primary care. The mentoring, training, and research aims ensure scientific growth in three areas: (1) Knowledge of advanced implementation science research methods; (2) Mixed methods research design and analysis; and (3) Leading multidisciplinary teams in cancer prevention and control. Environment: The OHSU Department of Family Medicine provides institutional support for this K07. Research and training activities also utilize the robust infrastructure of the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute (OCTRI), Knight Cancer Institute, and the Kaiser Permanente Northwest Center for Health Research. Methods: We will use an intervention mixed method design with embedded convergent and sequential components. To achieve Aim 1, we will conduct a multimodal (email, phone, in-person) survey of ORPRN practices (N~190), which are spread across Oregon's 16 Medicaid ACOs. We use generalized linear mixed models to identify factors associated with higher levels of readiness. To achieve Aim 2, we will use practice facilitation informed by the Getting to Outcomes™ approach, an evidence-based model that uses 10 steps to help organizations implement EBIs, to implement DM programs into four rural primary care clinics clustered in one Medicaid ACO (PacificSource Health Plans). We will assess the number of eligible patients reached (implementation outcomes) and the impact on CRC screening (intervention outcomes) and use a merging approach to cross-tabulate findings from clinic performance data with qualitative themes from observation visits and a baseline assessments of adaptive reserve and practice-readiness. In Aim 3, we will interview key informants from each practice (N~20) to identify DM program adaptations and elucidate barriers and facilitators to implementation. Outcomes: The training and research activities in this K07 fill critical gaps in scientific training for Dr. Davis. Findings provide essential pilot data on practice readiness, implementation strategies, and intervention adaptations which will inform an R01 submission in year 3 in response to PAR-16-238 to scale DM programs across rural clinics served by Oregon's Medicaid ACOs in a two arm pragmatic clinical trial. Findings address NCI agency priorities to implement EBIs and study multilevel interventions, help address long-standing CRC screening disparities, and propel Dr. Davis to research independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Colorectal cancer screening saves lives, yet over 40% of eligible adults have not been tested. This K07 explores the impact of multilevel interventions to improve colorectal cancer screening and treatment in rural and underserved patients and is designed to facilitate Dr. Davis' transition to research independence. Findings address colorectal cancer screening disparities and methods inform other cancer prevention and control strategies.",Using Context to Improve Implementation of Evidenced-based Interventions for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Rural Primary Care (Precise CRC),9386322,K07CA211971,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' family medicine ', ' Family Practice ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Planning ', ' Institutes ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Oregon ', ' Patients ', ' Phonation ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Research Activity ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' authority ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' developmental psychology ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' informant ', ' practice-based research network ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' Information Technology ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' multimodality ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' routine practice ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' Secure ', ' arm ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' screening ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' rural patients ', ' rural underserved ', ' rural setting ', ' ']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K07,2017,170639,0.19938747957584904
"Adaptive Intervention to Maximize Colorectal Screening in Safety Net Populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening related reductions in incidence and mortality are not benefiting all population subgroups. In clinical settings, repeat attempts at promoting screening are often required over time with the same patients. Few studies have evaluated whether repeated use of interventions in underserved groups can produce greater screening. Multi 'dose' interventions may be necessary to elevate screening rates to levels seen with breast and cervical cancer screening. This study will utilize a Bayesian adaptive design to study CRC screening in a highly diverse, safety-net clinic population. Although a growing number of studies have found implementation intentions-based interventions effective, no studies have tested such techniques twice in sequence to enhance CRC screening uptake. CRC screening implementation intentions address the ""when,"" ""where"" and ""how"" details of stool sample or colonoscopy screening. A randomized design will test a comparison condition of generic health education (HE) versus implementation intentions (I2), and, for participants who do not complete screening within six months, will re-randomize to one of these two strategies again. All intervention materials will be delivered via low-cost touch screen computers and tablets customized for use in English, Spanish, Nepali, Burmese, and Arabic for Somalis (to accommodate safety-net refugee clients). Pilot testing and formative phase focus groups will test the salience and appropriateness of touch screen audio, video, and graphic materials for each of these groups (except Nepali, where materials were recently developed and pilot tested). The study will be conducted with 500 patients eligible for CRC screening in a group of 9 safety- net primary care clinics. All participants will complete a touch screen administered screening form, informed consent, a baseline survey, and receive information on test options. Because of the rapidly changing insurance landscape for the underserved, we will not cover test costs beyond coverage already in place or obtained for each participant. Participants who complete screening within 6 months will only receive HE or I2 once. Those who do not screen will receive a second intervention dose and re-assessment of insurance status to test varied combination effects of HE +HE, HE + I2, I2 + I2, or I2 + HE on CRC screening completion. Changes or variations in health coverage will be analyzed as a co-variate. Six and 12-month phone surveys will be completed with all participants. The primary outcome will be CRC screening completion at 12 months. Secondary outcomes will come from a mediation analysis of the main outcome and co-variates. We will conduct a cost analysis of the intervention and its variable components. This study will provide important information on the utility and feasibility of embedding low-cost, implementation intentions-based interventions in ""real-world"" primary care, where they may be cost effective for repeated application over time with difficult to promote behaviors such as CRC screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although Colorectal Cancer (CRC) screening is now used by more of the age eligible population than in prior decades, many low-income and uninsured individuals remain unscreened. This project will test an adaptive and sequential intervention approach to maximize rates of screening among a safety-net clinic population suffering from high rates of CRC disparities. It will target a diverse sample of patients including low-income African Americans, Latinos, refugees, and Whites. We will use a Bayesian adaptive design to test the impact of one or two doses of an ""implementation intentions"" informed behavioral intervention versus generic health education on CRC screening. Study outcomes will be measured from fecal immunochemical test or colonoscopy reports from the study testing center.",Adaptive Intervention to Maximize Colorectal Screening in Safety Net Populations,9258408,R01CA188898,"['Accounting ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Client ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Computers ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Incidence ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Insurance ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phonation ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Privatization ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tablets ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Uninsured ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' Baseline Surveys ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Colorectal ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' safety net ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Burmese ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,621534,0.2827865174684771
"MUC13 Mucin in Colorectal Cancer Health Disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most lethal malignancy in the USA and affects over a million people every year. A significant CRC health disparity exists between African Americans (AA), American Indians (AI) and Caucasians (CA) in relation to its occurrence, drug response and mortality. Due to this, the overall mortality is highr among AA/AI compared to CA. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this disparity in AA/AI are not known. Therefore, it is highly imperative to understand the molecular basis and the identification of biomarker(s) that can be used for early stage diagnosis, metastasis and drug response to reduce this unacceptable health disparity. Our laboratory has identified a novel transmembrane mucin, MUC13, which is highly overexpressed/aberrantly localized in CRC and is involved in its pathogenesis. Additionally, our recent preliminary data suggest a markedly higher and aberrant expression of MUC13 in AA/AI CRC samples compared to CA counter parts. We have shown that MUC13 is an important modulator of several signal-transduction pathways and affects multiple key proteins involved in cell growth and survival, such as sonic hedgehog, HER2 and p53. Our published and preliminary studies have suggested an aberrant expression of MUC13 which has implications in CRC progression and metastasis. Based on these compelling evidence, we hypothesize that the differential/aberrant expression of MUC13 and/or MUC13 variants are underlying factors associated with CRC health disparity. In addition, we hypothesize this differential MUC13 expression is regulated by certain microRNAs (miR-145 and miR-132) and inflammatory mediators produced by the tumor microenvironment (e.g. interleukin-6 mediated STAT5B phosphorylation) resulting in malignant colorectal cancer cells phenotypes among AA/AI populations. Three specific aims with comprehensive experimental approach are proposed to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we propose to study the expression profile of MUC13 in Caucasians, African Americans and American Indians CRC tissues and its correlation with disease progression, metastasis and patient survival. Aim 2 will investigate the presence of MUC13 spliced variants/single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their association with chemoresistance, metastasis and CRC health disparity. Aim 3 intends to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of MUC13 regulation in clinically relevant CRC tissues and cell line models. We will also investigate how various intrinsic factors can induce aberrant/ altered subcellular localization of MUC13, in clinically relevant CRC cell line models, as aberrant subcellular localization (cytoplasmic, nuclear) of MUC13 has also been associated with disease stage, prognosis and metastasis. The results of this multi factorial study will determine if MUC13 can be used as a molecular signature for early detection of aggressive and metastatic CRC in AA and AI. This comprehensive study will further provide important insights regarding MUC13 etiology in CRC and help in designing preventive and therapeutic strategies to reduce CRC mortality and CRC health disparity in underserved populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Underserved populations such as African Americans (AA) and American Indians (AI) are experiencing increasing prevalence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC), thus understanding the molecular basis of this disparity and the identification of molecular signatures that can be used for early stage diagnosis are highly desirable.

"Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions to Improve Screening Among Rural Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2014 approximately 310,030 women in the United States (U.S.) will be diagnosed with breast cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CC), or colorectal cancer (CRC), and 68,060 women will die from these cancers. These three cancers account for 39% of the cancer burden and 25% of the cancer mortality among women in the U.S. Although effective screening tests are widely available for all three cancers, many women do not adhere to screening guidelines. Furthermore, the burden of these cancers is higher among some population groups and regions. Thirty-two rural counties in northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana share similar socioeconomically underserved populations of predominately (96.2%) white women who have elevated BC, CRC, and CC mortality rates, and lower screening rates with mammography, Pap tests, and fecal occult blood testing or colonoscopy. No known intervention has addressed improving screening rates for these three main female cancers simultaneously, even though multiple health behavior change research is emerging as a new model to change the way in which interventions can be packaged. The proposed project uses an overall theoretical framework to understand health disparities which includes individual, social and community level variables, and a conceptual model for the intervention which uses a multiple behavior theoretical approach, all of which have demonstrated efficacy in improving adherence to single screening test behaviors, as well as other preventive health behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to test the comparative effectiveness of a tailored interactive computer program delivered via DVD (TIDVD) vs. a TIDVD + telephone-based patient navigation (PN) intervention (TNI) vs. Usual Care (UC) to increase guideline-based screening rates for BC, CC, and CRC among women age 50 to 74 living in these rural counties of Ohio and Indiana. Specific aims are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of a tailored and interactive DVD (TIDVD) vs. TIDVD + telephone-based PN intervention (TNI) vs. UC, to increase guideline-based cancer screening rates at 12 months post randomization for BC, CC, and CRC among 1058 women age 50 to 74 living in rural northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana; and 2) compare the cost effectiveness of the TIDVD and the TIDVD + TNI intervention vs. UC, for adherence to each screening outcome or combination of screening tests. As an Exploratory Aim, we will identify associations between theoretical variables (community, social, and individual) and screening outcomes, including interactions with the interventions. If found to be cost effective, either or both interventions hae the potential to be immediately disseminated to increase BC, CC, and CRC screening rates and ultimately reduce cancer disparities for underserved rural women.

"Colorectal cancer disparities:Racial differences in colorectal adenopolyps and altered expression of Mitochondrial genes Abstract: Regardless of race, 50 years of age is the current screening recommendations for colorectal cancer (CRC) disease based on an assumption that the prevailing CRC disparities are relatively due to differences in access to quality screening and the post diagnostic therapies. However, several lines of evidence have suggested that in younger age groups, AA have twice the CRC incidence rate as Whites, and their stage- adjusted CRC survival rates are lower than Whites. Given that most CRCs arise from precancerous of adenomatous polyps (adenopolyps) that evolve into invasive adenocarcinoma, it is plausible that certain “modifying” genes expression may potentially responsible for the observation in AA experience to earlier adenopolyps initiation and more rapid adenopolyps progression to adenocarcinoma. If such is the case, one potential factor in the persistent of CRC disparities may be the race-nonconforming/or neutral age guideline for screening initiation. Studies regarding age-related AA-White differences in CRC progression through the intermediate stages (polyp sizes of tubular, tubulovillous, and villous, and dysplastic histology) are needed. To establish such evidence, it requires genetic alteration study in a modifying gene(s) and a tissue source representing the colorectal adenopolyp prevalence and profile in the population from a large enough autopsy sample size with complete adenopolyps clearance and having complete colorectal adenopolyps documentation. Our study will leverage a unique of 640 colorectal adenopolyp/ cancer cases and 1280 control tissue samples in a frequency matched nested case-control within our lab and Southern Division Co-operative Human tissues Network at University of Alabama collected through previous NIH-funded studies. The sample size has sufficient statistical power to compare AA and Whites on precancerous of colorectal adenopolyps prevalence and cancer-relevant features with difference age strata. These tissue collections are large and well-annotated by micro-dissection. Our laboratory recently demonstrated that there were progressive increase of mitochondrial gene expressions in colorectal adenopolyps and carcinomas when compared to their normal surrounding tissues (accepted paper Tumor Biology #TUBI-16-00926R1), suggesting that certain mt-genes expression are involved in the malignancy of colorectal adenopolyps to invasive adenocarcinoma. Based on these data, the central hypothesis of this project is that over-expression of certain mt-genes play a role in the aggressiveness of precancerous colorectal tumor behavior within younger AA which are reflected in their high incidence and low survival rate of this disease. To test this hypothesis, we will determine the level of mt-genes alterations in colorectal adenopolyps between AA-White subgroups. Also, we will evaluate our results relative to AA-White differences within 10 year age strata and their related features (size, histology, anatomic location, dysplasia status, and adenocarcinoma), as well as body mass index (BMI) using univariate statistical tests, multiple regression and cluster analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans (AA) have twice the CRC incidence rate as Whites, and survival rates are lower than Whites. Studies linking rapid colorectal polyps progression to cancer among AA Individual younger than 50 years old are lacking. This study will explore mitochondrial genes expression in colorectal adenopolyp tissue samples obtained from AA and white of difference age strata and results could potentially facilitate changes in the recommended screening age.",Colorectal cancer disparities:Racial differences in colorectal adenopolyps and altered expression of Mitochondrial genes,9532244,SC3GM122669,"['Adenocarcinoma ', '

"Developing a Barbershop-Based Trial on Masculinity Barriers to Care and Colorectal Cancer Screening Uptake among African-American Men using a Mixed Methods Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Charles R. Rogers, PhD, MPH, MS, CHES®’ long-term career goal is to become an independent researcher who utilizes community-based approaches to develop, implement, and evaluate culture-specific interventions to eliminate cancer disparities among African-American men. The training, research, and scholarship activities facilitated by this National Cancer Institute (NCI) Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01) will provide Dr. Rogers with the protected time to obtain the training essential for achieving his long-term career goal. The three key training areas for this K01 include instrument development and validation, mixed methods research, and intervention development and evaluation. A three-pronged approach has been developed by Rogers to reach his long-term career goal and complete his K01 plan, including: 1) a stellar team of interdisciplinary mentors and collaborators who will guide his research and career development; 2) an innovative research study integrated with his training goals that is both rigorous in its design and scientifically relevant; and 3) didactic coursework, professional exchanges, and workshops that build upon existing resources of the University of Minnesota Medical School and its NCI-designated Masonic Cancer Center. The purpose of Dr. Rogers’ research plan involves developing and pilot testing a theory-driven, culture-specific intervention that specifically targets masculinity barriers care and colorectal cancer (CRC) uptake among African-American men (ages 45-75). CRC is preventable as screening leads to identification and removal pre-cancerous polyps; however, African-American men consistently have the highest CRC mortality rates across all gender and racial/ethnic groups; and their CRC screening uptake remains low for uncertain reason. Contributing factors are etiologically complex, yet but culture-specific masculinity barriers to care may contribute to low CRC screening uptake among African-American men. Examining masculinity barriers to care is vital as CRC screening may challenge some cultural role expectations and self-representations of African-American men whose tendency is to delay help-seeking medical care. The study’s specific aims are to: 1) develop, validate, and test a culture- specific measure of masculinity barriers to care relative to CRC screening uptake among African-American men; and 2) develop and pilot test a theory-driven, culture-specific intervention that targets masculinity barriers to care, psychosocial factors, and CRC screening uptake among African-American men. Barbershops are historically known as culturally appropriate and trusted venues in African-American communities, and are critical for this research as they provide a pathway for reaching African-American men with masculinity barriers to care who are not regularly receiving healthcare services, and in particular, CRC screening. The proposed study and integrated training plan well-position Dr. Rogers to launch an independent investigator career focused on informing culture-specific interventions to eliminate cancer inequities among African-American men. PROJECT NARRATIVE African-American men have colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates 27% and 52% higher than non-Hispanic white men, and the highest rates among across all gender and racial/ethnic groups. Though contributing factors to CRC screening inequalities among African-American men are etiologically complex, few studies have examined the effects of masculinity barriers to care on CRC screening uptake among African- American men. This research proposes to design and pilot test a theory-driven, culture-specific intervention on masculinity barriers to care to improve CRC screening uptake among African-American men (ages 45-75).",Developing a Barbershop-Based Trial on Masculinity Barriers to Care and Colorectal Cancer Screening Uptake among African-American Men using a Mixed Methods Approach,9646150,K01CA234319,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Attitude ', ' Barbering ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cities ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Life Experience ', ' male ', "" Men's Role "", ' role men ', ' male role ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Perception ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Scholarship ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' sound ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Inequality ', ' Sample Size ', ' uptake ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Reporting ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' career development ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Center ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' systematic review ', ' pilot trial ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' stem ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' trial design ', ' University resources ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' recruit ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2018,175673,0.21098126060867
"Vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk: an integrated molecular and genetic epidemiologic study PROJECT ABSTRACT This K99/R00 Career Development Award will provide the applicant, Dr. Warren Andersen, with the research experience and training to propel her into a career as an independent investigator in the field of genetic and molecular epidemiology with a focus on the interplay between race, modifiable risk factors, and the genetic determinants of cancer risk and outcomes. The research plan uses Mendelian randomization methods to evaluate the hypothesis that circulating and bioavailable vitamin D levels are associated with decreased colorectal cancer risk. Mendelian randomization (MR) methods can be used to evaluate the associations between long-term exposures and diseases by using genetic variants as instrumental variables in place of exposures. Dr. Warren Andersen will also assess whether vitamin D binding protein modifies the association between vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk. The project will leverage resources from three established epidemiologic consortia (the ColoRectal Transdisciplinary Study (CORECT) consortium, a colorectal cancer genome-wide association study consortium among African Americans, and the Asia Colorectal Cancer Consortium) and the Southern Community Cohort Study to evaluate associations in large samples including individuals of European, Asian and African descent. Dr. Warren Andersen will create race-specific genetic scores to represent circulating vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein. Fine-mapping will be conducted to identify potentially causal variants to be included in the vitamin D genetic scores. These genetic scores will then be assessed for associations with overall colorectal cancer risk, and colorectal cancer risk stratified by specific characteristics of the tumor such as COX-2 expression, PIK3CA mutation status, and stage. During the Career Development Award Dr. Warren Andersen will gain additional skills in genetic analysis and increase her knowledge in colorectal cancer biology and health disparities. The findings from this research project will be used to develop and submit two R01 level projects before the completion of the Career Development Award. The additional experience gained from this Career Development Award will prepare Dr. Warren Andersen to be a leader in the field of genetic and molecular epidemiology of cancer, with expertise in colorectal cancer etiology, genetic and cancer epidemiology, and the root causes of racial differences in disease risk. This research topic is of much significance, as the Institute of Medicine's 2010 Report stated, investigation into the causal relationships between vitamin D and total and site-specific cancers is an important research need. The use of MR and molecular epidemiologic methods should provide a more definitive answer to the questions of the relationships of colorectal cancer risk with circulating vitamin D, bioavailable vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein. This study will provide insight into colorectal cancer etiology and potentially identify subgroups of individuals who may benefit the most from vitamin D supplementation. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to conduct a large molecular epidemiologic study using fine-mapping and Mendelian randomization methods in Whites, Asians, and African Americans to provide more definitive evidence regarding the association of circulating vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein with colorectal cancer risk. We will further study tumor markers to investigate possible mechanisms for the associations. This study will improve our understanding of colorectal cancer etiology and provide valuable data for designing cost-efficient measures to reduce the risk of this common malignancy.",Vitamin D and

"Internet-based Motivational Interviewing for Colonoscopy in African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to other racial groups, African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) morbidity and mortality rates. Although colonoscopies can prevent CRC, nearly half of African Americans (40.2%) have not received a screening colonoscopy within the recommended time frame (one colonoscopy per ten years). It is critical to increase African Americans' screening colonoscopy rates in order to reduce racial inequities in CRC morbidity and mortality. Dr. Miller's pilot work, as well as the current literature, suggest that an Internet-based Motivational Interviewing Intervention for Colonoscopy (I-MIIC) may help improve African Americans' screening colonoscopy uptake. The proposed project will first field-test the intervention, using an iterative approach, with African Americans referred for a screening colonoscopy (N=40). The field-testing results will guide the development, revisions, and finalization of the I-MIIC. Then, a randomized clinical trial will examine the efficacy of the -MIIC for improving African Americans' screening colonoscopy uptake. Participants (N=200) will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (N=100) in which they engage in a 20-minute I-MIIC intervention or a control group (N=100) in which they review a print brochure on CRC screening. The results will contribute to the growing literature on CRC disparities. Dr. Sarah Miller is the ideal candidate to spearhead this line of research given her academic and clinical background in CRC disparities and motivational interviewing. Dr. Miller's long-term goal is to become an independent researcher with expertise in the early detection and prevention of cancer in racial/ethnic minorities. To achieve her goals, as part of the K07, Dr. Miller will receie intensive training in four areas: 1) qualitative research; 2) e-Health; 3) longitudinal data analyss, and 4) professional development. The K07 will provide Dr. Miller with a variety of avenues to achieve her training goals and enhance her expertise. In particular, Dr. Miller will have ongoing meetings with seasoned mentors as well as participate in formal coursework, workshops, conferences, and interactive trainings. The proposed K07 will form the foundation for a program of research that focuses on improving cancer screening uptake in racial/ethnic minorities with the goal of reducing disparities. At the end of the K07 funding period, Dr. Miller will submit an R01 application, based on the results of the present study. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) is the ideal environment for Dr. Miller to complete her proposed research project and training. In particular, the ISMMS can offer Dr. Miller: 1) the resources necessary to complete her research; 2) access to multiple training activities; and 3) access to a diverse patient population. Most importantly, Dr. Miller will receive guidance from a team of superior mentors with expertise in: CRC disparities, qualitative research, biostatistics, e-Health, and primary care. The mentoring team will work closely with Dr. Miller to ensure that she achieves her research and training objectives. Overall, the K07 will provide Dr. Miller with the research experience, intensive training, and mentorship needed to become a successful independent researcher. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research has significant public health relevance. The development of an Internet-based motivational interviewing intervention for colonoscopy (I-MIIC) to increase African Americans' screening colonoscopy uptake will help to reduce disparities in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates. If the I- MIIC proves efficacious, there is a strong argument to replicate this intervention with other vulnerable populations and with other cancer tests.",Internet-based Motivational Interviewing for Colonoscopy in African Americans,9545705,K07CA190726,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Appointment ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Intestines ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Polyps ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Seasons ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Competence ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' prevent colorectal cancer ', ' colo-rectal cancer prevention ', ' CRC prevention ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' programs ', ' Test Result ', ' meetings ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Participant ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Reporting ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Preventive ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Premalignant ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Preparation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Cancerous ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' patient population ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' e-Health ', ' eHealth ', ' attentional control ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' intervention cost ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K07,2018,170640,0.23616207167541448
"Effectiveness and Implementation of mPATH-CRC:  a Mobile Health System for Colorectal Cancer Screening Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Screening for CRC reduces mortality and is widely recommended for all adults starting at age 50, yet over 35% of Americans remain unscreened. To address the multiple barriers to CRC screening (patient, clinician, and system), our team developed mPATH-CRC (mobile PAtient Technology for Health-Colorectal Cancer), a patient-friendly iPad program used by individuals immediately before a routine primary care visit. mPATH-CRC is a CRC screening decision aid that helps patients make a screening decision, allows patients to “self-order” a CRC screening test, and minimizes provider and system barriers. After the visit, mPATH-CRC automatically sends patients who choose to be screened supportive text messages at key times to help them complete their chosen test. In our recently completed randomized controlled trial of 450 diverse patients (R01CA178941), mPATH- CRC doubled the proportion of patients who completed CRC screening. To fully realize mPATH-CRC's potential to decrease CRC mortality, the program now must be implemented in primary care practices in a way that encourages routine and sustained use. However, while hundreds of mobile health (mHealth) tools have been developed in recent years, the optimal strategies for implementing and maintaining mHealth interventions in clinical practice are unknown. We have developed a “high touch” mHealth implementation strategy based on our prior research and guided by the Technology Acceptance Model and the Dynamic Sustainability Framework. Our strategy leverages evidence-based elements including clinic champions, facilitation, regular data feedback, follow-up training, and adaptation. Our team now proposes to compare the results of the “high touch” strategy to a “low touch” strategy using a Type III hybrid study design and incorporating mixed methods to evaluate implementation, maintenance, and effectiveness of mPATH-CRC in a diverse sample of community-based practices. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to: 1) in a cluster-randomized controlled trial of 28 primary care clinics, compare the implementation outcomes of a “high touch” evidence-based mHealth implementation strategy with a “low touch” implementation strategy; 2) in a nested pre-post study, estimate the effect of mPATH-CRC on completion of CRC screening within 16 weeks of visit; and 3) determine the factors that facilitate or impede the maintenance of mHealth interventions like mPATH-CRC by surveying and interviewing clinic staff and providers as part of a mixed-methods analysis. This project could decrease CRC morbidity and mortality by translating our evidence-based CRC-screening intervention into community practice, directly addressing the goals of Healthy People 2020 and the National Cancer Moonshot. Importantly, completion of these aims will yield essential information for successful implementation of other technology- mediated interventions in primary care settings, addressing a current gap in knowledge. mPATH-CRC is an innovative iPad app that patients use before a primary care medical visit to help them receive colorectal cancer screening, a widely recommended test that decreases mortality. However, while hundreds of health apps have been developed in recent years, the best strategies for incorporating apps in routine primary care remain unknown. This project will determine the optimal way to implement mPATH-CRC and other technology-based programs in community-based primary care practices, increasing the use of life- saving screening tests and improving the delivery of medical care.",Effectiveness and Implementation of mPATH-CRC:  a Mobile Health System for Colorectal Cancer Screening,9520693,R01CA218416,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Savings ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Community Practice ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' dissemination trial ', ' implementation trial ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community based practice ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' primary care setting ', ' secondary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' secondary analysis ', ' Text Messaging ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NCI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,553244,0.2758657905103999
"Salinomycin Targets Colorectal Cancer by Inhibiting Cancer Stem Cells and Telomerase PROJECT ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of death in most developed countries including the United States. The major cause of CRC patient death is by hepatic metastasis. Despite intensive studies, our knowledge about the nature of CRC metastasis cues and the mechanisms underlying their origination is still limited. Standard chemotherapy for CRC tumors relies on a number of cytotoxic drugs, targeted agents and their combinations. However, to date, we have no specific therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. There is an increasing need to develop alternative drugs targeting specific pathways that inhibit colorectal tumor growth and hepatic metastasis. The objective of this investigation is to develop salinomycin and MST-312 as novel therapeutic strategies for metastatic colorectal cancer. Salinomycin is a polyether antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces albus that acts as a potassium ionophore. Salinomycin possesses selective cancer stem cell inhibitory activity. We herein combine salinomycin with MST-312 for synergistic effects against metastasis. MST-312 (telomerase inhibitor IX) is a synthetic compound that acts as a telomerase inhibitor. Our central hypothesis is that dual targeting cancer stem cell and telomerase may synergize their anti-tumor effects and block hepatic metastasis via the eradication of colorectal cancer stem cells. We will test this hypothesis by performing the following specific aims. Aim 1: To determine whether hTERT signaling axis promotes the tumor initiation, drug resistance and metastatic potential of CD51+ colorectal cancer cells. Aim 2: To demonstrate that dual targeting CSCs and telomerase in colorectal cancer cells with salinomycin and MST- 312 significantly reduces cell invasiveness and stem cell-like traits compared to targeting CSCs and telomerase alone. Aim 3: To demonstrate in animal models that dual targeting with salinomycin and MST-312 inhibits the colon tumor proliferation and hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer xenografts compared to either agent alone. The results from the proposed experiments would expand our understanding of mechanisms of colon CSCs growth and metastasis inhibition resulting in a paradigm shift in treatment of CRC improving outcome for this deadly disease. Colorectal cancer (CRC), the incidence of which increases exponentially with aging, is the third deadliest cancer in the US. The high mortality is attributed to disease relapse and hepatic metastasis. Therefore, preventing metastasis would reduce poor treatment outcomes. To this end, we will target the telomerase and cancer stem cell populations which are playing important roles in colorectal cancer proliferation and metastasis. The primary goal of this investigation is to examine dual inhibition of telomerase and stemness as a novel therapeutic strategy for metastatic cancer. In addition, we will study experimental hepatic metastasis mechanism and metastasis blockade in an animal model. We expect that selective targeting telomerase and stemness offer a new therapeutic modality, and help to reduce health disparities from colorectal cancer.",Salinomycin Targets Colorectal Cancer by

"Using Context to Improve Implementation of Evidenced-based Interventions for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Rural Primary Care (Precise CRC) PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Melinda Davis has a PhD in social developmental psychology and is a Research Assistant Professor in the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) School of Medicine (Department of Family Medicine) and Assistant Professor in the OHSU-PSU School of Public Health (Health Behavior). She is the Director of Community Engaged Research for the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN) at OHSU. This K07 builds upon her applied experience as a practice facilitator and participatory researcher, addresses critical gaps in scientific training, and provides pilot data for an R01 submission in year 3 in response to PAR-16-238. Guided by a multidisciplinary team of mentors, Dr. Davis will, through this K07, consolidate her skills in implementation science, mixed-methods, and cancer prevention and control. She will also secure her transition to research independence. Research Focus: Bridging the gap between knowledge of evidence based interventions (EBIs) and application in “real world” settings is a critical issue in cancer prevention and control research. Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, yet disparities exist for rural and low-income populations. Although direct mail (DM) programs can increase CRC screening rates by nearly 40%, this EBI is not yet routine practice. Moreover, implementation and intervention outcomes vary widely across settings. Research is needed to inform how best to scale DM programs and to support follow-up colonoscopy on positive fecal tests. Guided by the social ecological model and consolidated framework for implementation research we propose three aims:  Aim 1: Identify factors associated with higher levels of primary care practice readiness to implement direct  mail programs to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.  H1: Leadership culture and higher levels of adaptive reserve will be associated with readiness.  Aim 2: Pilot test tailored implementation support for a direct mail program in four rural primary care  practices clustered in one Medicaid Accountable Care Organization (ACO).  Aim 3: Elucidate barriers, facilitators, and adaptations to direct mail program components and the  associated impact on implementation and intervention outcomes. Training Goals: The training proposed fills critical gaps to enable Dr. Davis to conduct trials to improve the identification, adaptation, and implementation of EBIs to improve cancer prevention in rural primary care. The mentoring, training, and research aims ensure scientific growth in three areas: (1) Knowledge of advanced implementation science research methods; (2) Mixed methods research design and analysis; and (3) Leading multidisciplinary teams in cancer prevention and control. Environment: The OHSU Department of Family Medicine provides institutional support for this K07. Research and training activities also utilize the robust infrastructure of the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute (OCTRI), Knight Cancer Institute, and the Kaiser Permanente Northwest Center for Health Research. Methods: We will use an intervention mixed method design with embedded convergent and sequential components. To achieve Aim 1, we will conduct a multimodal (email, phone, in-person) survey of ORPRN practices (N~190), which are spread across Oregon's 16 Medicaid ACOs. We use generalized linear mixed models to identify factors associated with higher levels of readiness. To achieve Aim 2, we will use practice facilitation informed by the Getting to Outcomes™ approach, an evidence-based model that uses 10 steps to help organizations implement EBIs, to implement DM programs into four rural primary care clinics clustered in one Medicaid ACO (PacificSource Health Plans). We will assess the number of eligible patients reached (implementation outcomes) and the impact on CRC screening (intervention outcomes) and use a merging approach to cross-tabulate findings from clinic performance data with qualitative themes from observation visits and a baseline assessments of adaptive reserve and practice-readiness. In Aim 3, we will interview key informants from each practice (N~20) to identify DM program adaptations and elucidate barriers and facilitators to implementation. Outcomes: The training and research activities in this K07 fill critical gaps in scientific training for Dr. Davis. Findings provide essential pilot data on practice readiness, implementation strategies, and intervention adaptations which will inform an R01 submission in year 3 in response to PAR-16-238 to scale DM programs across rural clinics served by Oregon's Medicaid ACOs in a two arm pragmatic clinical trial. Findings address NCI agency priorities to implement EBIs and study multilevel interventions, help address long-standing CRC screening disparities, and propel Dr. Davis to research independence.

"Participatory Research to Advance Colon Cancer Prevention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer death in the United States. This is troubling given that screening rates are marked by a pronounced disparity, with Latinos who have been in the United States for fewer than 10 years and the uninsured having the lowest rates. These individuals generally receive care at one of over 1,200 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) that serve over 21 million persons nationwide. While colorectal cancer screening rates among FQHC patients are a cause for great concern, studies have demonstrated success for improving screening rates. Programs that mail fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) kits with pictograph instructions to eligible patients report higher screening rates. While new technologies, such as automated phone calls and text messages, have been explored to remind patients to complete screening, little is known about their effectiveness in diverse populations. Moreover, such programs often adopt a one-size fits all approach and their effectiveness has not been tested among subgroups least likely to be screened. To address these issues, we will work with the advisory board assembled for our successful STOP CRC project and additional community stakeholders to adapt and spread a direct-mail FIT and reminder program (PROMPT) in two phases. In Phase I, we will design and evaluate a randomized controlled trial to test systems-based, automated and non-automated strategies to increase colorectal cancer screening in an FQHC with diverse patient populations. In Phase II, we will assess the spread of the program to 11 clinics (estimated age-eligible patient population ~ 22,000). The proposed study's design and evaluation will be guided by the RE-AIM framework using intervention mapping and will involve low-income and ethnically diverse patients who are served by Yakima Valley Farmworkers Clinic. PROMPT will be the first trial to sequentially test the effectiveness of reminders to a direct-mail colorectal cancer screening program, then spread the selected best practice to additional clinics within the FQHC network. PROMPT will apply novel and locally develop strategies to engage stakeholders in adapting the intervention, defining the intervention components, and selecting a best practice for spread. If the trial succeeds, it will have broad-scale implementation potential for a similar program to decrease cancer screening disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About half of the adults in the U.S. who should get screened for colorectal cancer do not get screened. Clinics that mail fecal tests to patients who are due for screening can increase screening rates and reduce screening disparities. With the goal of catching and treating cancers early, we will use a novel participatory approach to test reminders to a mailing program then test the spread of the program throughout a community clinic network.",Participatory Research to Advance Colon Cancer Prevention,9509533,U01MD010665,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Persons ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' farm worker ', ' farmworker ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' Home visitation ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' Yakima Valley ', ' Text Messaging ', ' screening program ', ' prevent colon cancer ', ' colon cancer prevention ', ' detect colon cancer ', ' colon cancer detection ', ' colon cancer screening ', ' patient portal ', ' screening disparities ', ' usual care control group ', ' usual care arm ', ' ']",NIMHD,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2018,530705,0.15593507223508793
"Colonic responses to vitamin D and aspirin in African- and European-Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  African Americans (AA) have the greatest burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the US, and biological reasons for this disparity remain incompletely understood. Interactions between host and environmental factors, including chemopreventive treatments, are known to modify CRC risk, and there is emerging evidence of differences in treatment effects between AA and European Americans (EA) for the two most promising chemopreventive agents, vitamin D and aspirin. Our broad objective is to model and understand how inter- ethnic differences in treatment responses could contribute to CRC disparities. Our laboratory has optimized stem cell-derived human organoid cultures to study cellular responses between individuals that have not been feasible using traditional models. In this proposal, we use colonic organoids to test the central hypothesis that transcriptional, chromatin accessibility and cellular responses to vitamin D and/or aspirin differ between AA and EA, and that these inter-ethnic differences could impact CRC risk and clinical treatment response.  We previously treated ex vivo primary colon tissue from AA and EA with active vitamin D (1,25D) and identified several genes with inter-ethnic response differences. The success of finding genes with inter-ethnic response differences provides rationale for extending our genome-wide approach to 1,25D, aspirin and combination treatments in a larger sample size of colonic organoids (80 AA & 80 EA) to achieve greater power to identify inter-ethnic differences in transcriptional networks as well as chromatin accessibility. We will replicate observed differences in an independent cohort of organoids as well as test for cancer-relevant cellular treatment phenotypes in a subset of treated organoids (50 AA & 50 EA) (Aim 1). Further, using RNA-seq data obtained in Aim 1, we will test for a genetic contribution to response differences between individuals and ethnicities using allele specific expression. The response genes and SNPs identified will be tested for enrichment among genes and SNPs from NIH-funded CRC GWAS and chemoprevention trials as well as tested mechanistically using functional assays (Aim 2).  The outcomes of our innovative study will: i) elucidate underlying biology and genetic architecture of responses to vitamin D and aspirin in the colon and how they differ by ethnicity, ii) connect cellular response with CRC risk and response to chemoprevention, and iii) identify genes and SNPs for mechanistic studies as well as for possible development as novel biomarkers for personalized CRC prevention in order to, ultimately, reduce CRC disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Environmental factors, including responses to treatments, play important roles in cancer risk in the colon. By studying how individuals respond to environmental factors, such as treatment with vitamin D and aspirin, we will learn about how cancer can be prevented, and it will be possible to predict who is most likely to benefit from these preventative interventions. This is especially important in African Americans who have the highest rates of colon cancer and are most likely to die from this preventable disease.",Colonic responses to vitamin D and aspirin in African- and European-Americans,9602436,R01CA220329,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Aspirin ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Attention ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chromatin ', ' Colon ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Maps ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Organoids ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Experimental Models ', ' delta opioid receptor ', ' δOR ', ' δ-OR ', ' δ opioid receptors ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' prevent colorectal cancer ', ' colo-rectal cancer prevention ', ' CRC prevention ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' Chemoprevention ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Host Factor ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' cell assay ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' anticarcinogenic ', ' anti-carcinogenic ', ' Chemopreventive ', ' Chemopreventive Agent ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' treatment effect ', ' high risk ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' novel marker ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' ATACseq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' targeted agent ', ' Risk stratification ', ' colorectal cancer risk ', ' genetic architecture ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2018,370575,0.09775891271533022
"Helicobacter pylori protein-specific antibodies and colorectal cancer risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common and third most deadly cancer in the US. Current evidence suggests that CRC incidence is increasing among both men and women younger than 50 years of age, who are also more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage disease. Additionally, there is a significant racial disparity, in that African American men and women experience a higher incidence of colorectal cancer compared to white men and women, and an even higher rate of death from colorectal cancer compared to the white population. Recent studies suggest that infection with Helicobacter pylori, a known gastric-cancer carcinogen, may also increase the risk of CRC, although these findings have been inconsistent. Two recent meta-analyses found statistically significant 40% to 50% increased odds for CRC among H. pylori-positive individuals. However, the majority of the studies surveyed did not take into account the H. pylori sub-type. It is known that, as H. pylori has evolved over 50,000 years to live in the human stomach, the bacteria have become highly diverse genetically. The proposed project builds on our work in the Southern Community Cohort Study, in which we found a statistically significant 60-80% increase in the odds of CRC for individuals sero-positive for one of five specific H. pylori proteins. For colon cancer alone, thes associations were stronger, so that sero- positivity to any of these five proteins was associated with a significant, approximate two-fold increased risk, most prominently for the known H. pylori virulence factor VacA (OR for VacA sero-positivity, 2.24). The association of VacA sero-positivity was particularly strong for CRC that has distant spread (OR, 5.67), among younger (<55 y) individuals (OR, 3.48), and for cancer of the right colon (OR, 3.13). Furthermore, a strong, significant, positive dose-response association across increasing quartiles of VacA antibody level was also observed. The current project seeks to produce the most definitive study to date of the H. pylori-CRC association through evaluation of the association in a large, collaborative nested case-control study (including over 4,000 prospectively-ascertained cases from 10 cohort studies spanning the US, and 1:1 matched controls), assessment of differences in the association by time from blood collection to diagnosis, and examination of the potential interaction of regular aspirin use on the association of H. pylori protein-specific infection with CRC risk. Thus, the current project allows us to thoroughly evaluate the novel association between Helicobacter pylori protein-specific infection and CRC risk, particularly for aggressive disease, building the groundwork for significantly strengthening CRC prevention and screening strategies with a new risk biomarker. Furthermore, this project provides the opportunity to potentially identify an infectious exposure to a common cancer that may be modifiable by a regimen of regular aspirin use, and moreover has already been proven to be modifiable through the use of H. pylori-eradication therapy and, thus, possibly holds great promise as a CRC prevention strategy.

"Culturally Targeted Loss Framed Messaging for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Afri DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary African-Americans are at a substantially increased risk of both developing and dying from colorectal cancer (CRC). This costly disparity can be largely attributed to African-Americans' diminished use of available CRC screenings. Although early detection of CRC via screening is highly beneficial, efforts to encourage their use among African-Americans have not been successful, suggesting a critical need to develop and evaluate effective health messaging strategies. In turn, health communication research has advocated the use of both loss-framed messaging and also personal prevention messaging to encourage illness detection b behaviors. However, the capacity of these messaging strategies to encourage CRC screening among African-Americans is not well understood. This includes limited knowledge about the potential of such messages to interface with perceptions of racism and medical mistrust that can impede screening behavior, and also whether loss-framed and personal prevention messages can be simultaneously employed to better promote CRC screening among African-Americans. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop health communications that reduce significant and costly ethnic health disparities, and to reveal psychological processes that underlie effective health messaging for ethnic minorities. The immediate objective of this application is to identify how gain and loss-framed messaging, as well as personal prevention messaging, may be used to reduce CRC screening disparities among African-Americans. The central hypothesis is that African-Americans will be best compelled to obtain screening for CRC when messages simultaneously emphasize personal prevention and are loss-framed. The specific aims are to 1) identify and compare effects of stand-alone gain versus loss- framed health messaging on African-Americans' CRC screening attitudes, intentions, and behavior; 2) identify and compare effects of gain versus loss-framed health messaging on African-Americans' perceived racism and medical mistrust; 3) determine the effect of coupling gain and loss-framed messages with a culturally-targeted personal prevention message on African-Americans' CRC screening attitudes, intentions, and behavior. The proposed research will develop and administer for unique versions of a CRC informational and screening video communication. These videos will be used to experimentally evaluate the effects of stand-alone and coupled loss-framed and personal prevention health messages on CRC screening attitudes, intentions, and behavior in a local sample of African-Americans. The proposed research will also identify the effects of health messages on perceived racism and medical mistrust. The public health implications of this project are significant. Namely, the proposed research will provide knowledge that is critical for developing and evaluating useful approaches to ethnic minority health messaging, and for better understanding how best to encourage cancer detection behaviors among African-Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative The proposed research will evaluate how broad-spectrum and culture-specific health messaging strategies can be combined to better promote colorectal cancer screening among African-Americans.

"MUC13 Mucin in Colorectal Cancer Health Disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most lethal malignancy in the USA and affects over a million people every year. A significant CRC health disparity exists between African Americans (AA), American Indians (AI) and Caucasians (CA) in relation to its occurrence, drug response and mortality. Due to this, the overall mortality is highr among AA/AI compared to CA. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this disparity in AA/AI are not known. Therefore, it is highly imperative to understand the molecular basis and the identification of biomarker(s) that can be used for early stage diagnosis, metastasis and drug response to reduce this unacceptable health disparity. Our laboratory has identified a novel transmembrane mucin, MUC13, which is highly overexpressed/aberrantly localized in CRC and is involved in its pathogenesis. Additionally, our recent preliminary data suggest a markedly higher and aberrant expression of MUC13 in AA/AI CRC samples compared to CA counter parts. We have shown that MUC13 is an important modulator of several signal-transduction pathways and affects multiple key proteins involved in cell growth and survival, such as sonic hedgehog, HER2 and p53. Our published and preliminary studies have suggested an aberrant expression of MUC13 which has implications in CRC progression and metastasis. Based on these compelling evidence, we hypothesize that the differential/aberrant expression of MUC13 and/or MUC13 variants are underlying factors associated with CRC health disparity. In addition, we hypothesize this differential MUC13 expression is regulated by certain microRNAs (miR-145 and miR-132) and inflammatory mediators produced by the tumor microenvironment (e.g. interleukin-6 mediated STAT5B phosphorylation) resulting in malignant colorectal cancer cells phenotypes among AA/AI populations. Three specific aims with comprehensive experimental approach are proposed to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we propose to study the expression profile of MUC13 in Caucasians, African Americans and American Indians CRC tissues and its correlation with disease progression, metastasis and patient survival. Aim 2 will investigate the presence of MUC13 spliced variants/single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their association with chemoresistance, metastasis and CRC health disparity. Aim 3 intends to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of MUC13 regulation in clinically relevant CRC tissues and cell line models. We will also investigate how various intrinsic factors can induce aberrant/ altered subcellular localization of MUC13, in clinically relevant CRC cell line models, as aberrant subcellular localization (cytoplasmic, nuclear) of MUC13 has also been associated with disease stage, prognosis and metastasis. The results of this multi factorial study will determine if MUC13 can be used as a molecular signature for early detection of aggressive and metastatic CRC in AA and AI. This comprehensive study will further provide important insights regarding MUC13 etiology in CRC and help in designing preventive and therapeutic strategies to reduce CRC mortality and CRC health disparity in underserved populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Underserved populations such as African Americans (AA) and American Indians (AI) are experiencing increasing prevalence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC), thus understanding the molecular basis of this disparity and the identification of molecular signatures that can be used for early stage diagnosis are highly desirable. This study will determine the role of MUC13, its variants/SNPs and its regulators (miRNAs, transcription factors and cytokines) in early diagnosis and disease progression and metastasis.

"Danyell S. Wilson-Howard Diversity Supplement for Dr. Janice Krieger's R01 Project Summary This diversity supplement application is based on the R01 awarded to Dr. Janice Krieger titled, “A patient- centered intervention using virtual technology to reduce colorectal cancer disparities in primary care” (1R01CA207689-01). Significant colorectal cancer (CRC) screening disparities result in higher rates of CRC- related morbidity and mortality for minority and rural patient populations, particularly in the southern United States. The development of interventions that capitalize on advances in communication, informatics, and computer science show great promise for resolving theoretical and practical problems associated with CRC screening decision-making. The goals of the parent project are: to evaluate the use of virtual human technology (VHT) in tailored CRC screening interventions for racial/ethnic minorities and rural patients aged 50-73, and to determine whether the efficacy of a CRC screening intervention can be improved using: (a) tailored message content, and/or (b) VHT delivery for promoting screening within guidelines among racial/ethnic minorities and rural patients. The ultimate goal of the parent project is to test whether a minimally tailored CRC intervention delivered via VHT will lead to increased adherence with initial and repeated annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening completion in the target populations – as compared to a fully tailored, text-only intervention. Project Narrative This project examines the privacy-protecting behaviors of older, rural, racial/ethnic minorities to provide a framework for understanding the factors that influence how marginalized people make health-privacy decisions. Further, this research will identify how people relate to new technologies, particularly health technologies, which may influence the use, adherence, and manipulation of these systems or devices.",Danyell S.

"Scaling Colorectal Cancer Screening Through Outreach, Referral, and Engagement (SCORE): A State-Level Program to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Burden in Vulnerable Populations PROJECT SUMMARY Despite strong evidence that colorectal cancer (CRC) screening reduces mortality, rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care (herein referred to as “CRC screening”) remain suboptimal in the US. In North Carolina (NC), underuse of screening contributes to particularly high CRC burden in certain regions. Community health centers (CHCs) play a critical role in providing CRC screening for these vulnerable populations. Yet, CRC screening rates in NC CHCs are well below the estimated national rate of 62%. Substantial efforts are needed to reach the national target of 80%. Because multiple patient-, provider-, and system-level factors contribute to low screening rates, multilevel interventions are needed to achieve screening targets. Accumulating evidence shows that interventions involving mailed screening outreach, practice-based screening in-reach (using patient navigators), and systematically improving colonoscopy access, all increase screening. However, in practice, CHCs face substantial resource limitations and lack the means to systematically implement a multi-level intervention of outreach, in-reach, and improved colonoscopy access for uninsured patients. Until a multi-level intervention is shown to be both effective and cost-effective from stakeholder perspectives, screening rates will remain low, leaving thousands of vulnerable patients at risk. We hypothesize that standardizing these interventions for CHCs at the state-level will yield cost-effective approaches to increasing screening. Our long-term goal is to reduce CRC burden and disparities through improved screening. Our objective here is to leverage our expertise in CRC screening intervention research, implementation science, stakeholder engagement, and modeling to achieve this goal for our state. Our central hypothesis is that a pragmatic trial assessing impacts and costs for combinations of these evidence-based interventions (EBIs) will yield one or more strategies that stakeholders find to be cost-effective and sustainable. The specific aims for our study are: Aim 1 (Planning and Exploratory Phase): Pilot test a multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening in vulnerable populations in three NC regions. In this phase, we will complete pilot studies needed for our signature trial, plan for implementation evaluation and sustainability, and develop a process for evaluating locally-developed innovative approaches for improving screening. Aim 2 (Implementation Phase): Building on Aim 1 findings, implement and evaluate multilevel CRC screening approaches in vulnerable populations in NC. In this phase, we will conduct our signature trial, assess implementation outcomes, evaluate the use of stakeholder-engaged modeling for sustaining and scaling the multilevel intervention, and select and evaluate locally-developed innovations for improving screening. This project is innovative in combining outreach and in-reach EBIs and in its use of stakeholder-engaged simulation modeling to inform sustainability. The proposed research is significant because it will have a substantial impact on CRC morbidity, mortality, and disparities in vulnerable communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project is relevant to public health because an effective strategy for improving colorectal cancer screening rates will lead to the prevention or early detection of thousands of colorectal cancer cases annually among minority, low-income, and uninsured patients. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NCI's mission to conduct and fund research that improves early detection and diagnosis and reduces cancer disparities.","Scaling Colorectal Cancer Screening Through Outreach, Referral, and Engagement (SCORE): A State-Level Program to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Burden in Vulnerable Populations",9627357,UG3CA233251,"['Adoption ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Goals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Measurement ', ' Program Sustainabilities ', ' Program Sustainability ', ' Funding ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' community intervention ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' implementation science ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' screening ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,UG3,2018,762693,0.2845007889835289
"Novel randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in patients with colorectal cancer: Impact on survival and biology PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Abundant preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that vitamin D possesses anti-neoplastic activity, and that individuals with higher plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels have lower risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and improved survival from CRC. Despite compelling evidence implicating vitamin D in CRC, critical questions remain about whether these findings reflect a true causal relationship, and what the biological mech- anisms of vitamin D activity are. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation to achieve sufficient levels of 25(OH)D leads to improved survival in CRC patients and influences several neoplastic pathways that can be exploited as biomarkers of efficacy and targets for novel treatment strategies. We will test this hypothe- sis within two novel randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation: a) a phase II double-blind random- ized trial of high- versus low-dose vitamin D3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic CRC, and b) a randomized trial of preoperative high-dose vitamin D3 versus placebo in patients with resectable colon cancer for examination of vitamin D biology in fresh human tumor tissue. We will also lever- age a rich prospective cohort of metastatic CRC patients enrolled in a completed NCI-sponsored phase III trial of chemotherapy (CALGB/SWOG 80405) to further define and validate biomarkers of vitamin D action. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of supplemental vitamin D on survival of CRC patients, test distinct hypotheses about the vitamin D dose-response relationship, and explore biomarkers of vitamin D status, response, and efficacy. We will investigate whether circulating levels of vitamin D binding protein and tumoral expression of vitamin D receptor, 1α-hydroxylase, and 24-hydroxylase are associated with improved survival within our ran- domized trials, and whether these markers modify the relationship between vitamin D and patient outcome. In Aim 2, we will conduct a precision medicine analysis of vitamin D to elucidate the mechanistic basis for its anti- tumor activity in CRC. We will explore the impact of vitamin D supplementation on tumoral markers of inflam- mation, lymphocytic infiltrates, and inflammatory gene signatures in surgical colectomy specimens from pa- tients treated with high-dose preoperative vitamin D3 versus placebo. We will also perform next generation se- quencing and Nanostring analysis of tumors from CRC patients with high- versus low vitamin D status to identi- fy unique genetic and transcriptional signatures associated with vitamin D-mediated carcinogenesis. In sum- mary, this translational proposal leverages innovative randomized trials of vitamin D to take the next critical steps in understanding vitamin D activity and biology in CRC. Our findings will confirm causality, provide new insights into biomarkers of vitamin D activity, and lead to potential inclusion of vitamin D into standard therapy – including immunotherapy – with the ultimate goal of improving the survival of patients with CRC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S., and may plausibly be linked to vitamin D deficiency. Abundant preclinical and epide- miologic data link lower levels of vitamin D to increased risk of and mortality from colorectal cancer; this is par- ticularly relevant given increasing rates of vitamin D deficiency in the U.S., as well as profound racial disparities in vitamin D status and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. In an era of expensive and often toxic anti- neoplastic drugs, vitamin D therefore represents an attractive and accessible treatment option for patients of all races and sociodemographic groups with

"Variations in Needs after Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Survivorship after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer, the third most common cancer in men and women, has many challenges. Research has shown that colorectal cancer survivors have unmet needs and worse physical and mental quality of life compared to individuals without cancer. Medically underserved populations are known risk groups for poor survivorship care, poor quality of survival, and poor quality of life after colorecal cancer. Sexual minority populations are medically underserved, according to a recent Institute of Medicine Report, yet at present their survivorship care and their quality of life after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer is unknown. The proposed study will determine whether disparities linked to sexual orientation exist in colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life. We will obtain a population-based sample of colorectal cancer survivors who differ by sexual orientation, applying our previously tested recruitment method, which uses cancer registry data from geographic areas with an above average density of sexual minority individuals. After collecting survey data on health care and quality of life, from heterosexual and sexual minority survivors, we will test three study hypotheses: 1) Sexual minority survivors will have poorer quality health care compared to heterosexual survivors, even after controlling for disease and non-disease factors. 2) Heterosexual survivors' quality of life will be better than sexual minority survivors' quality of life, even after controlling for disease and non-disease factors and quality health care. And 3) Sexual minority survivors who are at ease with their sexual minority identity will have better quality health care and quality of life than sexual minorty survivors who have difficulty with their identity. This study will be the first to comprehensively examine sexual minority colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life, illuminating the mechanisms that influence health care and quality of life. The findings will consist of modifiable and non-modifiable factors associated with sexual minority and heterosexual colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life. Researchers, health care providers, and policy makers can then intervene to address the modifiable factors identified by this study to facilitate improvement in diverse colorectal cancer survivors' health care and quality of life. Thi research is critically needed to realize the Institute of Medicine's goals of improving survivorshi in this special population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this study will provide information about the quality health care and the quality of life of colorectal cancers survivors of different sexual orientations. From the individual interviews with lesbian, gay, and bisexual survivors of colorectal cancer, we will derive salient factors to be included in our survey questionnaire. Using quantitative survey data obtained from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual survivors of colorectal cancers, who were recruited from three cancer registries, we will determine whether there are disparities by sexual orientation in colorectal cancer survivor's quality health care and quality of life. Ultimately, this population-based approach to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual colorectal cancer survivorship is a necessary step on which we expect to build with follow-up research that will use the findings of this study for the development and testing of interventions to improve the needs of lesbian, gay, and bisexual colorectal cancer survivors.",Variations in Needs after Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis,9513449,R01CA181392,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Buffers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' experience ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' Reporting ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' Sampling ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' data registry ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' recruit ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2018,497934,0.06789680106115636
"Normative Messages to Promote Colorectal Cancer Screening Uptake among African Americans Project Summary/Abstract  Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in the United States for both men and women. Despite gains in CRC survival, African Americans (AAs) still fare worse in CRC incidence and mortality compared to European Americans (EA). Given that CRC incidence and mortality are directly related to CRC screening, this disparity can be attributed to the corresponding screening disparity wherein AAs are less likely to attend CRC screening compared to EAs. It follows that interventions to increase CRC screening intentions and subsequent CRC screening behaviors among AAs are instrumental in addressing the disparities in CRC incidence and mortality. Video-based interventions have been used effectively in a number of CRC screening interventions aimed at AAs’ CRC screening knowledge and behaviors. Additionally, interventions that target individuals’ perceptions of behavioral norms have successfully influenced people’s engagement across a number of health behaviors; however, despite their promise, norm- based messages have not been utilized for CRC screening interventions with AAs. For the current study we will use an experimental design to examine the extent to which injunctive and descriptive norm messages about CRC screening influence AAs’ normative perceptions and CRC screening intentions. We will also examine the extent to which racial identity and group-based medical mistrust moderate the effects of norm messages. Finally, we will explore the effects of norm messaging on CRC screening uptake. We will test the following specific aims:  Aim 1: To (a) examine the unique effects of injunctive norm and descriptive norm messages on normative perceptions, CRC screening intentions, and (b) to explore whether the norm-messages foment stronger association between normative expectations and CRC screening intentions among a cohort of screen eligible AAs. We will recruit participants who are non-compliant with CRC screening.  Aim 2: To (a) examine the moderating roles of racial identity and group-based medical mistrust and (b) explore the moderating role of perceptions of barriers and behavioral control on the effects of normative messaging. We will examine whether norm-based messages lead to more favorable normative perceptions and stronger effects of normative perceptions, among participants who more strongly identify as AAs, who harbor greater group-based medical mistrust and who perceive fewer behavioral impediments.  Aim 3: To explore the effects of injunctive and descriptive norm messages on CRC screening uptake. We will explore whether participants who receive the norm-based interventions are more likely to request a CRC screening kit, and more likely to return the CRC screening kit, compared to participants who do not receive the intervention. Project Narrative  Disparities in colorectal cancer screening for African Americans (i.e., fewer African Americans screened relative to European Americans) are directly related to the disparities in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality faced by African Americans (i.e., more African American being diagnosed with and dying from colorectal cancer).

"Optimizing Colorectal Cancer Screening PREcision and Outcomes in CommunIty-baSEd Populations (PRECISE) Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Most deaths are preventable through early detection, but failures of screening completion and quality substantially impair test effectiveness. This proposal unites the productive PROSPR I CRC Centers into a single collaboration to address key questions and pilot interventions to improve CRC screening outcomes. In PROSPR I, we developed a strong transdisciplinary, multisite collaboration. We collected 316 data elements, performed validation studies, created high-quality pooled data sets to identify patient, provider, and system gaps in the CRC screening process factors and published >60 manuscripts. Our unified PROSPR II Research Center (PRC) will use these proven collaborations and >10 years of longitudinal data for >8.9 million screen-eligible people (~ 1 of 40 eligible people in the US), large numbers of screening exposures (>8.4 million fecal immunochemical tests [FIT] and >1.9 million colonoscopies), and outcomes (>28,000 CRCs). Our PRC is geographically, demographically and economically diverse (three states, >800,000 African Americans, 1.6 million Hispanics, and 1 million Asian Americans). The health systems have different CRC screening patterns, different modalities, and include all major insurance/reimbursement methods (safety net, Medicare, Medicaid, high-deductible and pre-paid/fee-for-service, staff-model and incentivized providers).  Our PROSPR I research identified major deficiencies in three areas of CRC screening: who should get screening and surveillance and when; why people do not complete recommended screening, surveillance or follow-up of positive tests; and how test quality and accuracy can be improved. Project 1 will identify on whom and when screening should be performed, particularly for those with conflicting recommendations (e.g., African Americans aged 40-49 years, and patients 76-85 years old). Project 2 will evaluate when surveillance should occur after a precancerous polyp diagnosis, using baseline colonoscopy results and precise new 10-year risk estimates for CRC. Project 3 will explore long-term screening patterns and multilevel drivers of why screening and surveillance are not appropriately completed, especially in understudied patients who never screen, fail to re-screen, use surveillance inappropriately or fail to follow up after a positive screening test. Project 4 will evaluate how to increase the effectiveness of FIT and colonoscopy by optimizing age- and sex-stratified quantitative FIT abnormal ranges, establishing precise adenoma detection thresholds for quality improvement and evaluating drivers of adenoma detection. We will use results from these observational studies, behavioral science methods, and stakeholder involvement to develop and pilot test multilevel interventions. Our transdisciplinary team of scientists, physicians, and healthcare experts will also provide leadership and data for trans-PROSPR, multiple-organ collaborations. The proposed research can substantially decrease the burden of CRC by reducing disparities and identifying ways to improve screening completion and effectiveness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Screening can reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in clinical trials. However, the real practice of screening in different community based populations differs from what can be achieved in trials. Optimizing screening strategies by characterizing potential failures of the screening process, improving the accuracy of screening tests, developing screening strategies tailored to personal risk and identifying ways to help more people complete screening offers substantial potential for decreasing colorectal cancer deaths.",Optimizing Colorectal Cancer Screening PREcision and Outcomes in CommunIty-baSEd Populations (PRECISE),9429336,UM1CA222035,"['adenoma ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Consultations ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Deductibles ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Incentives ', ' Incidence ', ' Insurance ', ' Leadership ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Polyps ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' aged 85 and older ', ' aged 85 and greater ', ' age 85 and older ', ' age 85 and greater ', ' 85+ years old ', ' human very old age (85+) ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Polypectomy ', ' PLYPCMY ', ' Colorectal ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Manuscripts ', ' validation studies ', ' Modality ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Detection ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', ' safety net ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' screening ', ' colorectal cancer patients ', ' colo-rectal cancer patients ', ' colon cancer patients ', ' precision screening ', ' personalized screening ', ' Patient risk ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' colorectal cancer risk ', ' preventable mortality ', ' preventable death ', ' ']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,UM1,2018,3264203,0.26455630864600027
"Adaptive Intervention to Maximize Colorectal Screening in Safety Net Populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening related reductions in incidence and mortality are not benefiting all population subgroups. In clinical settings, repeat attempts at promoting screening are often required over time with the same patients. Few studies have evaluated whether repeated use of interventions in underserved groups can produce greater screening. Multi 'dose' interventions may be necessary to elevate screening rates to levels seen with breast and cervical cancer screening. This study will utilize a Bayesian adaptive design to study CRC screening in a highly diverse, safety-net clinic population. Although a growing number of studies have found implementation intentions-based interventions effective, no studies have tested such techniques twice in sequence to enhance CRC screening uptake. CRC screening implementation intentions address the ""when,"" ""where"" and ""how"" details of stool sample or colonoscopy screening. A randomized design will test a comparison condition of generic health education (HE) versus implementation intentions (I2), and, for participants who do not complete screening within six months, will re-randomize to one of these two strategies again. All intervention materials will be delivered via low-cost touch screen computers and tablets customized for use in English, Spanish, Nepali, Burmese, and Arabic for Somalis (to accommodate safety-net refugee clients). Pilot testing and formative phase focus groups will test the salience and appropriateness of touch screen audio, video, and graphic materials for each of these groups (except Nepali, where materials were recently developed and pilot tested). The study will be conducted with 500 patients eligible for CRC screening in a group of 9 safety- net primary care clinics. All participants will complete a touch screen administered screening form, informed consent, a baseline survey, and receive information on test options. Because of the rapidly changing insurance landscape for the underserved, we will not cover test costs beyond coverage already in place or obtained for each participant. Participants who complete screening within 6 months will only receive HE or I2 once. Those who do not screen will receive a second intervention dose and re-assessment of insurance status to test varied combination effects of HE +HE, HE + I2, I2 + I2, or I2 + HE on CRC screening completion. Changes or variations in health coverage will be analyzed as a co-variate. Six and 12-month phone surveys will be completed with all participants. The primary outcome will be CRC screening completion at 12 months. Secondary outcomes will come from a mediation analysis of the main outcome and co-variates. We will conduct a cost analysis of the intervention and its variable components. This study will provide important information on the utility and feasibility of embedding low-cost, implementation intentions-based interventions in ""real-world"" primary care, where they may be cost effective for repeated application over time with difficult to promote behaviors such as CRC screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although Colorectal Cancer (CRC) screening is now used by more of the age eligible population than in prior decades, many low-income and uninsured individuals remain unscreened. This project will test an adaptive and sequential intervention approach to maximize rates of screening among a safety-net clinic population suffering from high rates of CRC disparities. It will target a diverse sample of patients including low-income African Americans, Latinos, refugees, and Whites. We will use a Bayesian adaptive design to test the impact of one or two doses of an ""implementation intentions"" informed behavioral intervention versus generic health education on CRC screening.

"A patient-centered intervention using virtual technology to reduce colorectal cancer disparities in primary care PROJECT ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Unfortunately, there are significant CRC screening disparities that result in higher rates of CRC-related morbidity and mortality for minority and rural patient populations, particularly in the southern United States. The development of interventions that capitalize on advances in communication, informatics, and computer science have great promise for resolving theoretical and practical problems associated with CRC screening decision-making. The purpose of this proposal is to test the efficacy of a patient-centered, tailored message intervention delivered via virtual technology for increasing CRC screening within guidelines among racial/ethnic minority and rural patients. We hypothesize that exposure to a minimally tailored CRC screening intervention delivered via VHT will lead to improved cognitive processing of the intervention and increased adherence with initial and repeated annual FIT screening completion as compared to a fully tailored, text-only intervention. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct focus groups and think-aloud interviews stratified by geography, gender, and racial/ethnic background to expand and pilot test an intervention that uses a virtual human as a delivery mechanism for CRC screening information. In Specific Aim 2, patients (N = 3,000) will be recruited via primary care clinics and a secure, clinical data warehouse to complete a patient- randomized test of the efficacy of the intervention for promoting initial and repeat FIT testing. Dependent measures will be assessed via patient self-report and chart review. The proposed study will reduce health disparities and associated morbidity and mortality due to CRC via increasing screening among racial/ethnic minority and rural populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE A primary goal of Healthy People 2020 is to increase the percentage of individuals screened for colorectal cancer (CRC) across population subgroups to 80%. The proposed study will reduce health disparities and associated morbidity and mortality due to CRC by increasing FIT screening among racial/ethnic minorities and rural patients through a novel, culturally sensitive intervention.",A patient-centered intervention using virtual technology to reduce colorectal cancer disparities in primary care,9419914,R01CA207689,"['Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Rural Population ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Individual ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' uptake ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' Exposure to ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' computer science ', ' Informatics ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Appearance ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient registry ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' virtual human ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' scale up ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' web-enabled ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' tailored messaging ', ' usability ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' prototype ', ' patient population ', ' efficacy testing ', ' clinical data repository ', ' clinical data warehouse ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' precision screening ', ' personalized screening ', ' rural patients ', ' recruit ', ' patient barriers ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' patient engagement ', ' screening disparities ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2018,615852,0.3155099810058364
"Culturally Adapted Multilevel Decision Support Navigation Trial to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Disparity among At-Risk Asian American Primary Care Patients PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans, and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) is ranked as the second most common in cancer deaths among Asian Americans. However, recent data show that CRC screening rates are substantially lower for Chinese and Korean Americans (CKAs) compared with other racial/ethnic groups. To date, a small number of community-based studies have reported on the use of single level (participant level only) interventions to increase CRC screening rates among CKAs; however, very little is known about the impact of multi-level (patient-oriented and provider-oriented) interventions on CRC screening adherence among CKA patients in primary care setting. Furthermore, our preliminary data indicate physician's recommendation as the strongest facilitator of CRC screening among CKAs. Thus, the primary objective of the study is to address this important knowledge gap by conducting a randomized controlled trial to determine the impact of a multi-level culturally-sensitive decision support intervention on CRC screening adherence among 400 CKA primary care patients. Previous studies found that facilitating patient decision-making through decision support and providing patient navigation can increase CRC screening among diverse primary care patients. We will culturally adapt existing evidence- based decision support navigation intervention (CA-DSNI) and test its efficacy among 200 CKA men and 200 CKA women aged 50 to 75 eligible for CRC screening. We will recruit the participants from primary care physicians (PCPs) clinics. The study is designed to compare CRC screening outcomes between the CA-DSNI and the Advanced Control (AC). Those randomized to the AC will receive an informational booklet, a stool blood test kit and a reminder by mail. Those randomized to the CA-DSNI will receive everything the AC receives. Additionally, we will provide decision support and navigation contacts to participants, develop an individualized screening plan using a theory-based online Decision Counseling Program, share the plan with the participants' PCPs, and have PCPs to encourage the screening to participants. Using outcomes data collected by survey and medical record review, we will: (1) determine overall CRC screening adherence in the CA-DSNI vs. the AC; (2) measure change in CRC screening decision stage in the CA-DSNI vs. the AC; and (3) Assess CRC screening test-specific (stool blood test vs. colonoscopy) adherence in the CA-DSNI vs. the AC. Additionally, we will evaluate intervention reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance using interview data. IMPACT: This study represents the first instance in which CA-DSNI will be used with CKAs in primary care practice settings to address a significant cancer disparity. With growing need for linguistically and culturally competent care, more decision support, language facilitation, and navigation efforts may come into care settings. Therefore, having tested interventions ready for the target population will be timely, and medical systems may benefit from having multilevel best practices known and tested for CKAs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans, but colorectal cancer screening rate remains low in this population. The goal of this R01 award application is to increase colorectal cancer screening among underserved Chinese and Korean Americans through cultural adaptation and implementation of a decision support navigation trial provided in primary care setting.

"Prediciting and addressing colonoscopy non-adherence in community settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. While research has shown that colorectal cancer screening decreases colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, only 65% of eligible adults were screened at the recommended interval in 2015. Even more troubling, those who are screened do not always get timely follow-up care for abnormal results. Dr. Lynn Butterly demonstrated that patient navigation can effectively raise rates of colonoscopy uptake among low-income, uninsured patients in New Hampshire, boosting rates 27 percentage points over usual care (96.2% vs 69.3%, P<.001). Using data from the STOP CRC study of 26 community clinics, our team developed a risk prediction model that can stratify patients according to their probability of adherence with follow-up colonoscopy. Our study will answer a key pragmatic question: can patient navigation effectively improve follow-up colonoscopy among patients who have a moderate or low probability of adhering to follow-up colonoscopy; and secondarily, does the effectiveness of patient navigation differ by patients’ probability level? We will build on our successful ongoing research to test a patient-level intervention, driven by the Chronic Care Model, to increase diagnostic follow-up for colorectal cancer screening. In Aim 1, we will validate the risk prediction model, stratify patients according to risk, and adapt patient navigation materials to local resources and settings. In Aim 2, we will conduct a two-arm randomized-controlled trial involving 28 clinics (~1200 patients with positive fecal tests) and will compare patient navigation and usual care in raising rates of follow-up colonoscopy. We will assess the effectiveness (completion of colonoscopy within 1 year) of the program overall, as well as the effectiveness by category of probability of adherence to follow-up colonoscopy (moderate vs. low). This large-scale, clinic-randomized, two-arm follow-up colonoscopy program among safety net patients will leverage the expertise of our research team, which has implemented numerous systems-based interventions in multiple health care settings and used electronic health record tools to deliver clinic-based interventions. We will build on these successes in undertaking the largest study to-date addressing follow-up colonoscopy uptake among patients who receive care in safety net clinics. This study could optimize the delivery of patient navigation, support the broad adoption of patient navigation programs, and greatly improve colonoscopy follow-up rates in this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Thousands of adults each year undergo screening for colorectal cancer through a fecal test, but those whose test results are positive do not always get timely follow-up colonoscopies. Our team has developed a model that can tell which patients are likely to get a follow-up colonoscopy, and we will use the model to test whether patient navigation can increase follow-up colonoscopy among patients who have a moderate or low probability of getting follow-up.

"Host genetic susceptibility to gut microbiota-driven colorectal carcinogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT After obtaining a Ph.D. in Microbiology, I pursued postdoctoral training in gastrointestinal oncology, with a focus on malignancies that represent health disparities among Hispanics. Throughout my doctoral training, I worked on various research projects that examined the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to gastric and colorectal cancer disparities among Hispanics, which led me to design the present study that combines my expertise in microbiology and gastrointestinal oncology to examine host genetic susceptibility to gut microbiota-driven colorectal cancer (a gene-environment interaction). Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death in Puerto Rico and the U.S. More than 60% of CRC patients in the U.S. are diagnosed at more advanced stages, emphasizing the need for CRC prevention and risk stratification strategies, that other than routine screening, are still unavailable. Host genetics and environmental factors, including inflammation and the gut microbiota, are accepted as major contributors to colorectal carcinogenesis. A dynamic balance between the host immune system and the gut microbiota is essential to protect colonic tissues against chronic inflammation, which may lead to CRC. Cytokines maintain the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory actions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter regions of the IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 genes, key cytokines that regulate inflammation in the gut, have been reported to alter their expression, increase inflammation, and are associated with CRC. Intestinal inflammation has also been shown to alter the gut microbiota by enriching Gram-negative bacteria, some of which have toxins that may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis. The main goal of this study is to investigate if SNPs in the promoter regions of the IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 genes, key cytokines that regulate inflammation in the gut, increase the risk for colorectal adenomas (CRC precursor lesions) by enriching a subset of toxin-producing gut microbiota (gene-environment interaction). The central hypothesis is that individuals with pro-inflammatory genotypes have increased colonic inflammation that leads to an enrichment of toxin-producing gut microbiota, thereby promoting the carcinogenic process. This study proposes three innovative, hypothesis-driven Specific Aims. Using a case- control study design, Aim 1 & 2 will examine the association between SNPs in key cytokine genes, gut bacteria toxin genes, and colorectal adenomas. Aim 3 will result in the generation of an in vitro enteroid model to study the mechanisms underlying the CRC-promoting host genetic-gut microbiota interactions. The significance of this study is that it will contribute to a better understanding of host genetic susceptibility to gut microbiota- driven CRC (gene-environment interaction) and will be the foundation for the development of host gene- and/or bacterial gene-based CRC prevention and/or risk stratification strategies that will ultimately help reduce CRC incidence and mortality. The protected time provided by this award will be invaluable for the development of my independent research track and for the generation of strong preliminary data for future grant submissions. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 1st and 3rd leading cause of cancer-related death in men and women in the Puerto Rico and the United States, respectively; however, CRC prevention and risk stratification strategies, other than routine screening, are still unavailable. The current proposal aims to gain insight into the interplay between host genetic susceptibility and the gut microbiota by examining if polymorphisms in key cytokines that regulate inflammation increase risk for colorectal adenomas, CRC precursor lesions, when exposed to a subset of toxin-producing gut microbiota using a case-control study design and by generating in vitro enteroid (“mini-intestine”) model. The data generated by this study will provide important information about host genetic susceptibility to microbiome-driven colorectal carcinogenesis (gene-environment interaction) and will lay the foundation for the development of host gene- and/or bacterial gene-based CRC prevention and/or risk stratification strategies that will ultimately help reduce CRC incidence and mortality.",Host

"(ACCSIS) Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia This multi-site project aims to increase screening and follow-up for colorectal cancer (CRC) in central Appalachia, a medically underserved region recognized as one of three distinct “hotspots” for CRC mortality. Specifically, the Appalachian Regional Commission classifies 32 eastern Ohio (OH) counties and the 54 counties in eastern Kentucky (KY) as north central and central Appalachia, respectively. CRC incidence and mortality rates in the area are among the highest in the nation, and neither state meets the national target of 80% of eligible residents screened for CRC. There have been few randomized intervention trials addressing multiple levels of influence on CRC screening behaviors and outcomes in this region. To address this gap, investigators at the University of Kentucky and The Ohio State University will build on a 12-year collaborative history, strong relationships with Appalachian communities and health clinics, and extensive experience with community-based cancer prevention and control intervention research to develop, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention (MLI) – adapted from evidence-based interventions that include components targeting clinics and providers (in-reach) and the community (outreach) – to increase CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care among patients age 50-74 in 12 counties in Appalachian KY and OH. The overall goals of this project are to contribute to the evidence-base for a MLI that increases rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care, particularly in rural, medically underserved populations, and help showcase best practices for how MLIs can be scaled-up to reduce the burden of CRC in the U.S. For the Planning-Exploratory Phase (UG3) in Year 1, our specific aims are to: 1) Pilot test, measure, and refine a MLI to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care in Appalachian OH and Appalachian KY; and 2) Provide evidence supporting transition to the Implementation Phase (UH3) [per NCI approval]. For the Implementation Phase (UH4) in Years 2-5, our specific aims are to: 1) Test the revised MLI in a group randomized trial, delayed intervention to assess the impact of the MLI on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among Appalachian KY and Appalachian OH populations; and 2) Assess dissemination and sustainability of the intervention. The project will be implemented in collaboration with community and clinical partners in 12 counties, 6 in Ohio and 6 in Kentucky. Counties will be randomized to early or delayed intervention after baseline data collection. The main outcome will be CRC screening as defined by US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines and measured by clinic electronic health records and county- level behavioral assessments using random digit dialed telephone surveys similar to CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Our work will be accomplished through collaboration with the ACCSIS Coordinating Center, other ACCSIS Research Projects, ACCSIS Steering Committee and Workgroups, NCI, and community partners. If effective, this MLI will be disseminated to our clinical and community partners throughout Appalachia. This project will implement and evaluate community and clinical interventions designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer in Appalachian regions of Ohio and Kentucky. The first year of the project will develop and refine the interventions to be implemented and tested in the next 4 years. Results will showcase best practices for how multilevel interventions can be scaled-up to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer in the U.S.",(ACCSIS) Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia,9627516,UG3CA233282,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Area Health Education Centers ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Data Collection ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Kentucky ', ' Low Income Population ', ' mortality ', ' Ohio ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Savings ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Administrator ', ' Rural Community ', ' Caring ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Trust ', ' Rural ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' uptake ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' experience ', ' Localized Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Localized Malignancy ', ' Localized Cancer ', ' Local Cancer ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' Provider ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Address ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' safety net ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' medically underserved ', ' implementation science ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' screening ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,UG3,2018,770562,0.3082283123888368
"Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening and Follow-up through Implementation Science (ACCSIS) Program PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT To advance research in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in support of the goals of the Beau Biden Cancer MoonshotSM Initiative, RTI International proposes to serve as the Coordinating Center (CC) for the Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening and follow-up through Implementation Science (ACCSIS) Program. As the CC, RTI will provide scientific expertise and logistical support to create a cohesive research group that will develop the evidence base to increase CRC screening, diagnosis, and referral-to-care among populations who currently have low rates of screening. Specifically, we will (1) enhance productivity of ACCSIS Program members and stakeholders by providing necessary logistical, communications, and operational support; (2) support the generation of the evidence base on multilevel interventions to increase CRC screening by establishing common data elements and harmonized data collection procedures across research projects; (3) identify and support locally-developed innovative approaches to accelerate the evaluation of additional promising interventions to increase CRC screening; and (4) generate a user-friendly data repository and disseminate program findings to facilitate the adaption and scale-up of successful interventions. RTI has specific strengths that will enhance the scientific productivity of the program, including the following six. (1) We will use previously tested procedures and policies, based on our experience as the CC for more than 35 multisite projects, to enhance coordination among ACCSIS studies. (2) Our team, led by Dr. Sujha Subramanian, has more than a decade of experience in CRC screening studies, and will be supported by a multidisciplinary team of experts in implementation science, heath systems and community clinical linkages, heath disparities, multisite data collection, biostatistics, ethics and health data regulations, web design, data repository management, and dissemination. (3) We will enhance existing frameworks for common data collection that we have developed through our partnership with more than 40 CRC implementation programs by expanding the frameworks to include moderators and mediators. Expansion will allow us to understand the underlying pathways at each level of the intervention (patient, provider, and organization or community). (4) We will draw upon our ready-built network of CRC stakeholders to incorporate lessons learned from prior implementation studies and to identify locally-developed innovative approaches. (5) We will leverage internal expertise in implementation science methods and conduct mixed analysis using both quantitative and qualitative data to perform a comprehensive assessment of the cross- site findings from the multilevel interventions. (6) We will combine our leadership in communication science methods with our award-winning multimedia team to deliver an evidence-based branding strategy and dissemination plan to increase the visibility and reach of the ACCSIS Program.

"Host-environment interactions in colorectal cancer disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a health burden worldwide that is highly prevalent and deadly but also preventable. African Americans (AAs) suffer disproportionately from CRC in the US, and biological factors underlying these disparities remain understudied. Environmental exposures, such as active vitamin D ( 1α,25(OH)2D3) , interact with normal colon to modify CRC development. If we could understand how these interactions differ between individuals or populations, they could be harnessed to identify those at highest CRC risk and potentially identify new ways to prevent this cancer. Until now, traditional models could not study host-environment interactions between individuals in human colon. To address this gap, we have established an experimental framework that uses primary ex vivo colon culture and human organoid culture to study inter-individual and inter-ethnic differences in responses to environmental exposures. Our initial work has identified a promising candidate, uridine phosphorylase 1 (UPP1), a key enzyme of uridine homeostasis and pyrimidine salvage that showed significant inter-ethnic differences in transcriptional response to 1α,25(OH)2D3. A knock out mouse of uridine phosphorylase led to spontaneous colon tumors due to DNA damage providing rationale for studying this candidate in the context of CRC disparities. In this exploratory study, we will test the hypothesis that 1α,25(OH)2D3  regulates uridine homeostasis and DNA damage in the colon, and that this regulation differs between populations (Aim 1). Having found that our experimental framework is productive and promising, we will extend it to identify inter-ethnic differences in gene expression and in chromatin accessibility in response to vitamin D with greater power compared to our preliminary study (Aim 2). Ultimately, this exploratory work is the basis for larger, comprehensive studies of inter-individual and inter-ethnic host-environment interactions in CRC susceptibility. In an era where the need for precision medicine at the individual and population level is recognized, our studies will determine how 1α,25(OH)2D3 responses differ across populations that eventually might lead to personalized vitamin D-based interventions for CRC prevention especially in AAs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Environmental factors play an important role in cancer development in the colon. By studying how individuals respond to environmental factors, such as vitamin D, we will learn about how cancer develops and it will be possible to predict who is at highest risk and would benefit from preventative interventions.

"The Interplay of Behavior, Environment, and Microbiota in Colorectal Cancer Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Tiffany Carson is an applied epidemiologist with a background in studying health disparities of black and white women. Dr. Carson's early work focused on behaviors related to diet, physical activity, obesity and related health outcomes. Recently, Dr. Carson has focused on applying her research efforts to better understand cancer disparities of black and white women. Dr. Carson's overarching career goal is to become an independently funded investigator and develop evidence-based bio-behavioral interventions to reduce cancer health disparities. To that end, this application proposes a rigorous research project and training plan focused on investigating the microbiota as a novel potential contributor to colorectal cancer (CRC) disparities between black and white women. CRC is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the United States    accounting for 9% of cancer deaths. Known risk factors for CRC include increasing age, male sex, family history, inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical inactivity, high consumption of red and processed meats and high fat diet, and obesity. Among women, even after accounting for differences in the distribution of risk factors, black women remain at 48% greater risk for CRC than white women. There is a growing body of research suggesting that the influence of diet on CRC risk is mediated through the microbiota and that microbial perturbations caused by diet, lifestyle, and antibiotics can lead to increased risk for CRC and other chronic diseases. Stress is one factor that has been shown to lead to alterations in the microbiota. Our research has shown that black women report moderate to high stress levels and additional published literature indicates that black women report higher stress levels than their white counterparts. These observations have lead to our hypothesis that a greater proportion of black women have a perturbed microbiota as a result of higher stress levels compared to white women, putting black women at greater risk for developing CRC. In the present proposal, we plan to explore this hypothesis employing a case control study design comparing the following groups: 1) black and white women with incident CRC from the Kirklin Clinic at UAB and 2) age-matched cancer-free black and white female community controls. Specifically, we will first characterize the oral and gut microbiota of black and white women with CRC and compare by race with particular focus on microbes known to be either positively or negatively associated with CRC. Because all cases will have CRC, we hypothesize that there will be no significant racial differences in the microbiota or other known risk factors for CRC such as diet. In contrast, when we repeat this experiment in cancer-free black and white female community controls, we expect to observe racial differences in the microbiota, with black women having less health-promoting bacteria and more pathogenic bacteria than white women, which would put black women at increased risk for CRC. We anticipate that a greater proportion of black females in the control group will have microbiota that resembles the microbiota of participants with CRC. Additionally, if our hypothesis is supported, psychological stress with be inversely associated with health-promoting bacteria and positively associated with pathogenic bacteria. Our findings will provide insight into how lifestyle factors that have not been fully explored to date such as stress may be associated with risk for CRC as a result of how stress perturbs the microbiota. If we determine that stress contributes to CRC risk via microbial perturbations, future bio-behavioral interventions that incorporate stress management and dietary/supplemental recommendations to promote mucosal health, and therefore reduce CRC risk, can be developed and implemented which could lead to diminished health care costs related to diagnosis and treatment and reduce CRC disparities between black and white women. In addition to providing valuable data, the proposed research project will also provide the opportunity for the additional training needed for Dr. Carson's development as an independently funded bio-behavioral cancer disparities researcher. Dr. Carson will engage in an intensive, structured training experience to develop expertise by completing the following: 1) Training in the recruitment of racially diverse clinical and community populations for bio-specimen and bio-banking research, 2) Obtaining hands-on and didactic training in bioinformatics techniques, and 3) Improving professional skills such as team science, networking, grant writing, mentoring, and high-impact publications. Under the guidance of an esteemed panel of mentors and collaborators and the high quality research and training environment that the University of Alabama at Birmingham offers, Dr. Carson's research and training experiences will make a significant contribution to the scientific community and Dr. Carson's overall career development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the USA, and the disparity between black and white women remains unexplained. This study will evaluate novel biological, behavioral and environmental factors that may contribute to this disparity. Findings from this study will provide insight into whether stress and the microbiot contribute to risk for CRC and possibly lead to innovative interventions to reduce CRC incidence and disparities.","The Interplay of Behavior, Environment, and Microbiota in Colorectal Cancer Risk",9547306,K01CA190559,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alabama ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol

"A Multilevel CBPR Intervention to Improve Colorectal Cancer Screening in Underserved Vietnamese Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third highest cause of mortality in Vietnamese and Asian Americans. CRC incidence is rising rapidly in Vietnamese Americans, but they have among the lowest rates of CRC screening (14%) and are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease, which is highly preventable. Over 85% of Vietnamese Americans in our region (PA, NJ and NYC) are foreign-born with limited English proficiency, have low SES, and live in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Many lack knowledge about CRC risks and screening benefits, and have limited access to culturally appropriate preventive care. Thus, a multilevel intervention is needed to address the multiple barriers to and determinants of CRC screening in this community. Vietnamese community organizations (VCOs) serve dynamic social functions and represent an important resource for addressing this critical health disparity priority by promoting CRC screening. This project builds on established partnerships and successful work of Center for Asian Health, Temple University with Vietnamese CBOs that address their critical health disparities. CBPR principles will be applied to engage 20 VCOs in all phases of planning, implementing, evaluating, and disseminating a culturally appropriate, theory- and evidence-based multilevel CRC intervention. The proposed intervention will be guided by Social Ecological Model, which addresses sociocultural, behavioral and environmental determinants and intervention strategies at individual, interpersonal, and community organizational levels. CDC's Clinical Preventive Services Guidelines for adults 50+ (CPS) recommend that cancer screenings and other preventive services should be promoted. The standard CPS will be provided to both intervention and control groups, and intervention group will receive CPS + multilevel CRC intervention. Specific Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that CPS + multilevel CRC intervention will yield higher CRC screening rates compared to CPS control at 12-month follow up; Aim 2 is to examine whether CPS + multilevel CRC intervention (which includes CHW-led group education, automated and interactive text messaging and phone-based peer support) is more effective in changing screening determinants (e.g. KAB, self-efficacy, risk factors, lifestyles, social support, social norms, access barriers) than CPS control condition; and Aim 3 is to assess costs and cost-effectiveness of CPS + multilevel CRC intervention compared to CPS control condition in relation to CRC screening rates in order to inform future dissemination efforts. In sum, this project represents the first large-scale community-based randomized controlled trial of a multilevel, culturally-appropriate CBPR intervention to increase CRC screening among underserved Vietnamese. If effective, this innovative multilevel CRC intervention can be used as a model program that has potential generalizability and sustainability in Asian American and other underserved ethnic communities to impact preventive behaviors at population level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in Vietnamese Americans (VAs) but they have among the lowest rates of CRC screening (14%) and are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease, which is highly preventable. Although promoting preventive care for at-risk populations is a public health priority, little is known about effective CRC screening intervention for the fast-growing and undeserved VAs and this project aims to determine the effectiveness of a multilevel, theory- and evidence- based CBPR intervention to increase CRC screening in underserved VAs. This innovative multilevel intervention is the first of its kind in the US that is tailored to the speciic needs, characteristics and assets of this disparity population, and has potential generalizability and sustainability in Asian American and other underserved ethnic communities to impact preventive behaviors at population level.",A Multilevel CBPR Intervention to Improve Colorectal Cancer Screening in Underserved Vietnamese Americans,9403939,U01MD010627,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Logic ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' prevent colorectal cancer ', ' colo-rectal cancer prevention ', ' CRC prevention ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' member ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' social ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Sum ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Social Functioning ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' ethnic disadvantage ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' public health priorities ', ' screening ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' peer support ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' Text Messaging ', ' colorectal cancer risk ', ' ']",NIMHD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,U01,2018,891113,0.28251438410321383
"Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening and Follow-up through Implementation Science (ACCSIS) Program PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT To advance research in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in support of the goals of the Beau Biden Cancer MoonshotSM Initiative, RTI International proposes to serve as the Coordinating Center (CC) for the Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening and follow-up through Implementation Science (ACCSIS) Program. As the CC, RTI will provide scientific expertise and logistical support to create a cohesive research group that will develop the evidence base to increase CRC screening, diagnosis, and referral-to-care among populations who currently have low rates of screening. Specifically, we will (1) enhance productivity of ACCSIS Program members and stakeholders by providing necessary logistical, communications, and operational support; (2) support the generation of the evidence base on multilevel interventions to increase CRC screening by establishing common data elements and harmonized data collection procedures across research projects; (3) identify and support locally-developed innovative approaches to accelerate the evaluation of additional promising interventions to increase CRC screening; and (4) generate a user-friendly data repository and disseminate program findings to facilitate the adaption and scale-up of successful interventions. RTI has specific strengths that will enhance the scientific productivity of the program, including the following six. (1) We will use previously tested procedures and policies, based on our experience as the CC for more than 35 multisite projects, to enhance coordination among ACCSIS studies. (2) Our team, led by Dr. Sujha Subramanian, has more than a decade of experience in CRC screening studies, and will be supported by a multidisciplinary team of experts in implementation science, heath systems and community clinical linkages, heath disparities, multisite data collection, biostatistics, ethics and health data regulations, web design, data repository management, and dissemination. (3) We will enhance existing frameworks for common data collection that we have developed through our partnership with more than 40 CRC implementation programs by expanding the frameworks to include moderators and mediators. Expansion will allow us to understand the underlying pathways at each level of the intervention (patient, provider, and organization or community). (4) We will draw upon our ready-built network of CRC stakeholders to incorporate lessons learned from prior implementation studies and to identify locally-developed innovative approaches. (5) We will leverage internal expertise in implementation science methods and conduct mixed analysis using both quantitative and qualitative data to perform a comprehensive assessment of the cross- site findings from the multilevel interventions. (6) We will combine our leadership in communication science methods with our award-winning multimedia team to deliver an evidence-based branding strategy and dissemination plan to increase the visibility and reach of the ACCSIS Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Use of recommended screening tests can reduce colorectal cancer mortality, but screening uptake is suboptimal. As the Coordinating Center for the Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening and follow-up through Implementation Science (ACCSIS) Program, RTI International will facilitate coordination and collaboration among the ACCSIS Research Projects and locally-developed innovated approaches to provide the evidence base on multilevel interventions necessary to scale up colorectal cancer screening, follow-up, and referral to care, especially among minorities and other vulnerable populations.",Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening and Follow-up through Implementation Science (ACCSIS) Program,10006947,U24CA233218,"['theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Health system ', ' Coordination and Collaboration ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' systematic review ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' user-friendly ', ' comparative ', ' implementation science ', ' evidence base ', ' successful intervention ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' health data ', ' webinar ', ' data warehouse ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Banks ', ' Infrastructure ', ' screening guidelines ', ' screening recommendations ', ' recommended screening ', ' Adoption ', ' Award ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Feedback ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Productivity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Teleconferences ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Schedule ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Collaborations ', ' Consensus ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohesion ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Regulation ', ' ']",NCI,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,U24,2019,785056,0.2907344539696178
"Scaling Colorectal Cancer Screening Through Outreach, Referral, and Engagement (SCORE): A State-Level Program to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Burden in Vulnerable Populations PROJECT SUMMARY Despite strong evidence that colorectal cancer (CRC) screening reduces mortality, rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care (herein referred to as “CRC screening”) remain suboptimal in the US. In North Carolina (NC), underuse of screening contributes to particularly high CRC burden in certain regions. Community health centers (CHCs) play a critical role in providing CRC screening for these vulnerable populations. Yet, CRC screening rates in NC CHCs are well below the estimated national rate of 62%. Substantial efforts are needed to reach the national target of 80%. Because multiple patient-, provider-, and system-level factors contribute to low screening rates, multilevel interventions are needed to achieve screening targets. Accumulating evidence shows that interventions involving mailed screening outreach, practice-based screening in-reach (using patient navigators), and systematically improving colonoscopy access, all increase screening. However, in practice, CHCs face substantial resource limitations and lack the means to systematically implement a multi-level intervention of outreach, in-reach, and improved colonoscopy access for uninsured patients. Until a multi-level intervention is shown to be both effective and cost-effective from stakeholder perspectives, screening rates will remain low, leaving thousands of vulnerable patients at risk. We hypothesize that standardizing these interventions for CHCs at the state-level will yield cost-effective approaches to increasing screening. Our long-term goal is to reduce CRC burden and disparities through improved screening. Our objective here is to leverage our expertise in CRC screening intervention research, implementation science, stakeholder engagement, and modeling to achieve this goal for our state. Our central hypothesis is that a pragmatic trial assessing impacts and costs for combinations of these evidence-based interventions (EBIs) will yield one or more strategies that stakeholders find to be cost-effective and sustainable. The specific aims for our study are: Aim 1 (Planning and Exploratory Phase): Pilot test a multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening in vulnerable populations in three NC regions. In this phase, we will complete pilot studies needed for our signature trial, plan for implementation evaluation and sustainability, and develop a process for evaluating locally-developed innovative approaches for improving screening. Aim 2 (Implementation Phase): Building on Aim 1 findings, implement and evaluate multilevel CRC screening approaches in vulnerable populations in NC. In this phase, we will conduct our signature trial, assess implementation outcomes, evaluate the use of stakeholder-engaged modeling for sustaining and scaling the multilevel intervention, and select and evaluate locally-developed innovations for improving screening. This project is innovative in combining outreach and in-reach EBIs and in its use of stakeholder-engaged simulation modeling to inform sustainability. The proposed research is significant because it will have a substantial impact on CRC morbidity, mortality, and disparities in vulnerable communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project is relevant to public health because an effective strategy for improving colorectal cancer screening rates will lead to the prevention or early detection of thousands of colorectal cancer cases annually among minority, low-income, and uninsured patients. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NCI's mission to conduct and fund research that improves early detection and diagnosis and reduces cancer disparities.","Scaling Colorectal Cancer Screening Through Outreach, Referral, and Engagement (SCORE): A State-Level Program to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Burden in Vulnerable Populations",9997416,UH3CA233251,"['Adoption ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Hybrids ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Measurement ', ' Program Sustainability ', ' Program Sustainabilities ', ' Funding ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' community intervention ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' implementation science ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' screening ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,UH3,2019,1134289,0.2845007889835289
"A patient-centered intervention using virtual technology to reduce colorectal cancer disparities in primary care PROJECT ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Unfortunately, there are significant CRC screening disparities that result in higher rates of CRC-related morbidity and mortality for minority and rural patient populations, particularly in the southern United States. The development of interventions that capitalize on advances in communication, informatics, and computer science have great promise for resolving theoretical and practical problems associated with CRC screening decision-making. The purpose of this proposal is to test the efficacy of a patient-centered, tailored message intervention delivered via virtual technology for increasing CRC screening within guidelines among racial/ethnic minority and rural patients. We hypothesize that exposure to a minimally tailored CRC screening intervention delivered via VHT will lead to improved cognitive processing of the intervention and increased adherence with initial and repeated annual FIT screening completion as compared to a fully tailored, text-only intervention. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct focus groups and think-aloud interviews stratified by geography, gender, and racial/ethnic background to expand and pilot test an intervention that uses a virtual human as a delivery mechanism for CRC screening information. In Specific Aim 2, patients (N = 3,000) will be recruited via primary care clinics and a secure, clinical data warehouse to complete a patient- randomized test of the efficacy of the intervention for promoting initial and repeat FIT testing. Dependent measures will be assessed via patient self-report and chart review. The proposed study will reduce health disparities and associated morbidity and mortality due to CRC via increasing screening among racial/ethnic minority and rural populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE A primary goal of Healthy People 2020 is to increase the percentage of individuals screened for colorectal cancer (CRC) across population subgroups to 80%.

"Role of Circadian Factors in Inflammation and Colorectal Adenoma Risk Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common and deadly forms of cancer. In South Carolina, our group has documented racial CRC disparities that exceed national rates. Most colon tumors arise from adenomas (adenomatous polyps) that are detected via a screening colonoscopy. Gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation and aberrant DNA methylation are key processes driving adenoma formation and CRC risk. Sleep loss and circadian rhythm disruption can induce inflammation, alter DNA methylation, and increase CRC risk. African- Americans (AAs) differ from European-Americans (EAs) in their endogenous circadian timing, and they are more likely than EAs to have poor sleep and excessive stress (allostatic overload or ‘weathering’). This case- control study will test the hypothesis that disruption of circadian processes and sleep is associated with inflammation and adenoma risk among AA and EA patients receiving a screening colonoscopy. Molecular timekeeping is controlled by ‘clock genes’ that regulate circadian gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms. Clock genes can modulate inflammation (e.g., TNFα, IL-6 expression), and they act as tumor suppressors (e.g., the ‘Period’ or PER genes). Our research suggests that genetic variation or aberrant methylation in PER genes is associated with increased adenoma risk, and that sleep disorders can increase CRC risk. Melatonin is a clock-regulated hormone that suppresses GI inflammation and inhibits colon tumor growth by binding to its cellular receptors (MT-1, RORα). This study will characterize biobehavioral circadian disruption indicators (sleep disturbances, social jet lag, fatigue, stress), along with key molecular correlates (PER3 genotype and methylation of: clock genes [PER1, PER2, PER3]; clock-controlled genes [MT-1, RORα, TNFα, IL-6]; and global DNA methylation [LINE-1]) to determine their role in inflammation and adenoma risk. A biobehavioral framework will address the following Specific Aims: 1) Conduct a case-control study among patients undergoing a screening colonoscopy to determine whether circadian disruption indicators (DNA methylation, biobehavioral, genetic) are associated with adenoma case status relative to controls, and if the relationship is modified by race (N=1,000; 400 cases, 600 controls); 2) Determine if circadian disruption indicators are associated with inflammation in normal GI tissue (TNFα, IL-6 mRNA expression); 3) Determine whether behavioral and molecular circadian disruption indicators are related; 4) Among adenoma cases, determine if methylation of candidate circadian genes in adenomas differs from normal GI tissue. Our team has a strong track record of providing high quality colonoscopy services and in engaging AA and EA communities in research. Prospective data collection (relative to colonoscopy) and the use of valid, quantitative biobehavioral and molecular measures will limit the potential introduction of bias. This study will rigorously examine circadian-based behavioral and molecular risk factors as they relate to GI inflammation and colorectal adenoma risk. Circadian-based risk factors may serve as novel, modifiable targets for CRC prevention. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common and deadly forms of cancer, and the racial CRC disparity in South Carolina exceeds the national average. This study will use a biobehavioral case-control design to determine whether the disruption of circadian rhythms and sleep, including their genetic and epigenetic (DNA methylation) correlates, is associated with inflammation or colorectal adenomas among African- and European- American patients receiving a screening colonoscopy. Our study will rigorously evaluate whether circadian- based factors may serve as novel, modifiable targets for CRC prevention.",Role of Circadian Factors in Inflammation and Colorectal Adenoma

"Novel randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in patients with colorectal cancer: Impact on survival and biology PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Abundant preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that vitamin D possesses anti-neoplastic activity, and that individuals with higher plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels have lower risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and improved survival from CRC. Despite compelling evidence implicating vitamin D in CRC, critical questions remain about whether these findings reflect a true causal relationship, and what the biological mech- anisms of vitamin D activity are. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation to achieve sufficient levels of 25(OH)D leads to improved survival in CRC patients and influences several neoplastic pathways that can be exploited as biomarkers of efficacy and targets for novel treatment strategies. We will test this hypothe- sis within two novel randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation: a) a phase II double-blind random- ized trial of high- versus low-dose vitamin D3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic CRC, and b) a randomized trial of preoperative high-dose vitamin D3 versus placebo in patients with resectable colon cancer for examination of vitamin D biology in fresh human tumor tissue. We will also lever- age a rich prospective cohort of metastatic CRC patients enrolled in a completed NCI-sponsored phase III trial of chemotherapy (CALGB/SWOG 80405) to further define and validate biomarkers of vitamin D action. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of supplemental vitamin D on survival of CRC patients, test distinct hypotheses about the vitamin D dose-response relationship, and explore biomarkers of vitamin D status, response, and efficacy. We will investigate whether circulating levels of vitamin D binding protein and tumoral expression of vitamin D receptor, 1α-hydroxylase, and 24-hydroxylase are associated with improved survival within our ran- domized trials, and whether these markers modify the relationship between vitamin D and patient outcome. In Aim 2, we will conduct a precision medicine analysis of vitamin D to elucidate the mechanistic basis for its anti- tumor activity in CRC. We will explore the impact of vitamin D supplementation on tumoral markers of inflam- mation, lymphocytic infiltrates, and inflammatory gene signatures in surgical colectomy specimens from pa- tients treated with high-dose preoperative vitamin D3 versus placebo. We will also perform next generation se- quencing and Nanostring analysis of tumors from CRC patients with high- versus low vitamin D status to identi- fy unique genetic and transcriptional signatures associated with vitamin D-mediated carcinogenesis. In sum- mary, this translational proposal leverages innovative randomized trials of vitamin D to take the next critical steps in understanding vitamin D activity and biology in CRC. Our findings will confirm causality, provide new insights into biomarkers of vitamin D activity, and lead to potential inclusion of vitamin D into standard therapy – including immunotherapy – with the ultimate goal of improving the survival of patients with CRC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S., and may plausibly be linked to vitamin D deficiency. Abundant preclinical and epide- miologic data link lower levels of vitamin D to increased risk of and mortality from colorectal cancer; this is par- ticularly relevant given increasing rates of vitamin D deficiency in the U.S., as well as profound racial disparities in vitamin D status and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. In an era of expensive and often toxic anti- neoplastic drugs, vitamin D therefore represents an attractive and accessible treatment option for patients of all races and sociodemographic groups with respect to both safety and cost.",Novel randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in patients with colorectal cancer: Impact on survival and biology,9653971,R01CA205406,"['Affect ', '

"Prediciting and addressing colonoscopy non-adherence in community settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. While research has shown that colorectal cancer screening decreases colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, only 65% of eligible adults were screened at the recommended interval in 2015. Even more troubling, those who are screened do not always get timely follow-up care for abnormal results. Dr. Lynn Butterly demonstrated that patient navigation can effectively raise rates of colonoscopy uptake among low-income, uninsured patients in New Hampshire, boosting rates 27 percentage points over usual care (96.2% vs 69.3%, P<.001). Using data from the STOP CRC study of 26 community clinics, our team developed a risk prediction model that can stratify patients according to their probability of adherence with follow-up colonoscopy. Our study will answer a key pragmatic question: can patient navigation effectively improve follow-up colonoscopy among patients who have a moderate or low probability of adhering to follow-up colonoscopy; and secondarily, does the effectiveness of patient navigation differ by patients’ probability level? We will build on our successful ongoing research to test a patient-level intervention, driven by the Chronic Care Model, to increase diagnostic follow-up for colorectal cancer screening. In Aim 1, we will validate the risk prediction model, stratify patients according to risk, and adapt patient navigation materials to local resources and settings. In Aim 2, we will conduct a two-arm randomized-controlled trial involving 28 clinics (~1200 patients with positive fecal tests) and will compare patient navigation and usual care in raising rates of follow-up colonoscopy. We will assess the effectiveness (completion of colonoscopy within 1 year) of the program overall, as well as the effectiveness by category of probability of adherence to follow-up colonoscopy (moderate vs. low). This large-scale, clinic-randomized, two-arm follow-up colonoscopy program among safety net patients will leverage the expertise of our research team, which has implemented numerous systems-based interventions in multiple health care settings and used electronic health record tools to deliver clinic-based interventions. We will build on these successes in undertaking the largest study to-date addressing follow-up colonoscopy uptake among patients who receive care in safety net clinics. This study could optimize the delivery of patient navigation, support the broad adoption of patient navigation programs, and greatly improve colonoscopy follow-up rates in this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Thousands of adults each year undergo screening for colorectal cancer through a fecal test, but those whose test results are positive do not always get timely follow-up colonoscopies. Our team has developed a model that can tell which patients are likely to get a follow-up colonoscopy, and we will use the model to test whether patient navigation can increase follow-up colonoscopy among patients who have a moderate or low probability of getting follow-up.

"Vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk: an integrated molecular and genetic epidemiologic study PROJECT ABSTRACT This K99/R00 Career Development Award will provide the applicant, Dr. Warren Andersen, with the research experience and training to propel her into a career as an independent investigator in the field of genetic and molecular epidemiology with a focus on the interplay between race, modifiable risk factors, and the genetic determinants of cancer risk and outcomes. The research plan uses Mendelian randomization methods to evaluate the hypothesis that circulating and bioavailable vitamin D levels are associated with decreased colorectal cancer risk. Mendelian randomization (MR) methods can be used to evaluate the associations between long-term exposures and diseases by using genetic variants as instrumental variables in place of exposures. Dr. Warren Andersen will also assess whether vitamin D binding protein modifies the association between vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk. The project will leverage resources from three established epidemiologic consortia (the ColoRectal Transdisciplinary Study (CORECT) consortium, a colorectal cancer genome-wide association study consortium among African Americans, and the Asia Colorectal Cancer Consortium) and the Southern Community Cohort Study to evaluate associations in large samples including individuals of European, Asian and African descent. Dr. Warren Andersen will create race-specific genetic scores to represent circulating vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein. Fine-mapping will be conducted to identify potentially causal variants to be included in the vitamin D genetic scores. These genetic scores will then be assessed for associations with overall colorectal cancer risk, and colorectal cancer risk stratified by specific characteristics of the tumor such as COX-2 expression, PIK3CA mutation status, and stage. During the Career Development Award Dr. Warren Andersen will gain additional skills in genetic analysis and increase her knowledge in colorectal cancer biology and health disparities. The findings from this research project will be used to develop and submit two R01 level projects before the completion of the Career Development Award. The additional experience gained from this Career Development Award will prepare Dr. Warren Andersen to be a leader in the field of genetic and molecular epidemiology of cancer, with expertise in colorectal cancer etiology, genetic and cancer epidemiology, and the root causes of racial differences in disease risk. This research topic is of much significance, as the Institute of Medicine's 2010 Report stated, investigation into the causal relationships between vitamin D and total and site-specific cancers is an important research need. The use of MR and molecular epidemiologic methods should provide a more definitive answer to the questions of the relationships of colorectal cancer risk with circulating vitamin D, bioavailable vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein. This study will provide insight into colorectal cancer etiology and potentially identify subgroups of individuals who may benefit the most from vitamin D supplementation. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to conduct a large molecular epidemiologic study using fine-mapping and Mendelian randomization methods in Whites, Asians, and African Americans to provide more definitive evidence regarding the association of circulating vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein with colorectal cancer risk. We will further study tumor markers to investigate possible mechanisms for the associations.

"Colonic responses to vitamin D and aspirin in African- and European-Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  African Americans (AA) have the greatest burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the US, and biological reasons for this disparity remain incompletely understood. Interactions between host and environmental factors, including chemopreventive treatments, are known to modify CRC risk, and there is emerging evidence of differences in treatment effects between AA and European Americans (EA) for the two most promising chemopreventive agents, vitamin D and aspirin. Our broad objective is to model and understand how inter- ethnic differences in treatment responses could contribute to CRC disparities. Our laboratory has optimized stem cell-derived human organoid cultures to study cellular responses between individuals that have not been feasible using traditional models. In this proposal, we use colonic organoids to test the central hypothesis that transcriptional, chromatin accessibility and cellular responses to vitamin D and/or aspirin differ between AA and EA, and that these inter-ethnic differences could impact CRC risk and clinical treatment response.  We previously treated ex vivo primary colon tissue from AA and EA with active vitamin D (1,25D) and identified several genes with inter-ethnic response differences. The success of finding genes with inter-ethnic response differences provides rationale for extending our genome-wide approach to 1,25D, aspirin and combination treatments in a larger sample size of colonic organoids (80 AA & 80 EA) to achieve greater power to identify inter-ethnic differences in transcriptional networks as well as chromatin accessibility. We will replicate observed differences in an independent cohort of organoids as well as test for cancer-relevant cellular treatment phenotypes in a subset of treated organoids (50 AA & 50 EA) (Aim 1). Further, using RNA-seq data obtained in Aim 1, we will test for a genetic contribution to response differences between individuals and ethnicities using allele specific expression. The response genes and SNPs identified will be tested for enrichment among genes and SNPs from NIH-funded CRC GWAS and chemoprevention trials as well as tested mechanistically using functional assays (Aim 2).  The outcomes of our innovative study will: i) elucidate underlying biology and genetic architecture of responses to vitamin D and aspirin in the colon and how they differ by ethnicity, ii) connect cellular response with CRC risk and response to chemoprevention, and iii) identify genes and SNPs for mechanistic studies as well as for possible development as novel biomarkers for personalized CRC prevention in order to, ultimately, reduce CRC disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Environmental factors, including responses to treatments, play important roles in cancer risk in the colon. By studying how individuals respond to environmental factors, such as treatment with vitamin D and aspirin, we will learn about how cancer can be prevented, and it will be possible to predict who is most likely to benefit from these preventative interventions.

"Host genetic susceptibility to gut microbiota-driven colorectal carcinogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT After obtaining a Ph.D. in Microbiology, I pursued postdoctoral training in gastrointestinal oncology, with a focus on malignancies that represent health disparities among Hispanics. Throughout my doctoral training, I worked on various research projects that examined the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to gastric and colorectal cancer disparities among Hispanics, which led me to design the present study that combines my expertise in microbiology and gastrointestinal oncology to examine host genetic susceptibility to gut microbiota-driven colorectal cancer (a gene-environment interaction). Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death in Puerto Rico and the U.S. More than 60% of CRC patients in the U.S. are diagnosed at more advanced stages, emphasizing the need for CRC prevention and risk stratification strategies, that other than routine screening, are still unavailable. Host genetics and environmental factors, including inflammation and the gut microbiota, are accepted as major contributors to colorectal carcinogenesis. A dynamic balance between the host immune system and the gut microbiota is essential to protect colonic tissues against chronic inflammation, which may lead to CRC. Cytokines maintain the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory actions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter regions of the IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 genes, key cytokines that regulate inflammation in the gut, have been reported to alter their expression, increase inflammation, and are associated with CRC. Intestinal inflammation has also been shown to alter the gut microbiota by enriching Gram-negative bacteria, some of which have toxins that may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis. The main goal of this study is to investigate if SNPs in the promoter regions of the IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 genes, key cytokines that regulate inflammation in the gut, increase the risk for colorectal adenomas (CRC precursor lesions) by enriching a subset of toxin-producing gut microbiota (gene-environment interaction). The central hypothesis is that individuals with pro-inflammatory genotypes have increased colonic inflammation that leads to an enrichment of toxin-producing gut microbiota, thereby promoting the carcinogenic process. This study proposes three innovative, hypothesis-driven Specific Aims. Using a case- control study design, Aim 1 & 2 will examine the association between SNPs in key cytokine genes, gut bacteria toxin genes, and colorectal adenomas. Aim 3 will result in the generation of an in vitro enteroid model to study the mechanisms underlying the CRC-promoting host genetic-gut microbiota interactions. The significance of this study is that it will contribute to a better understanding of host genetic susceptibility to gut microbiota- driven CRC (gene-environment interaction) and will be the foundation for the development of host gene- and/or bacterial gene-based CRC prevention and/or risk stratification strategies that will ultimately help reduce CRC incidence and mortality. The protected time provided by this award will be invaluable for the development of my independent research track and for the generation of strong preliminary data for future grant submissions. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 1st and 3rd leading cause of cancer-related death in men and women in the Puerto Rico and the United States, respectively; however, CRC prevention and risk stratification strategies, other than routine screening, are still unavailable. The current proposal aims to gain insight into the interplay between host genetic susceptibility and the gut microbiota by examining if polymorphisms in key cytokines that regulate inflammation increase risk for colorectal adenomas, CRC precursor lesions, when exposed to a subset of toxin-producing gut microbiota using a case-control study design and by generating in vitro enteroid (“mini-intestine”) model. The data generated by this study will provide important information about host genetic susceptibility to microbiome-driven colorectal carcinogenesis (gene-environment interaction) and will lay the foundation for the development of host gene- and/or bacterial gene-based CRC prevention and/or risk stratification strategies that will ultimately help reduce CRC incidence and mortality.",Host

"Participatory Research to Advance Colon Cancer Prevention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer death in the United States. This is troubling given that screening rates are marked by a pronounced disparity, with Latinos who have been in the United States for fewer than 10 years and the uninsured having the lowest rates. These individuals generally receive care at one of over 1,200 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) that serve over 21 million persons nationwide. While colorectal cancer screening rates among FQHC patients are a cause for great concern, studies have demonstrated success for improving screening rates. Programs that mail fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) kits with pictograph instructions to eligible patients report higher screening rates. While new technologies, such as automated phone calls and text messages, have been explored to remind patients to complete screening, little is known about their effectiveness in diverse populations. Moreover, such programs often adopt a one-size fits all approach and their effectiveness has not been tested among subgroups least likely to be screened. To address these issues, we will work with the advisory board assembled for our successful STOP CRC project and additional community stakeholders to adapt and spread a direct-mail FIT and reminder program (PROMPT) in two phases. In Phase I, we will design and evaluate a randomized controlled trial to test systems-based, automated and non-automated strategies to increase colorectal cancer screening in an FQHC with diverse patient populations. In Phase II, we will assess the spread of the program to 11 clinics (estimated age-eligible patient population ~ 22,000). The proposed study's design and evaluation will be guided by the RE-AIM framework using intervention mapping and will involve low-income and ethnically diverse patients who are served by Yakima Valley Farmworkers Clinic. PROMPT will be the first trial to sequentially test the effectiveness of reminders to a direct-mail colorectal cancer screening program, then spread the selected best practice to additional clinics within the FQHC network. PROMPT will apply novel and locally develop strategies to engage stakeholders in adapting the intervention, defining the intervention components, and selecting a best practice for spread. If the trial succeeds, it will have broad-scale implementation potential for a similar program to decrease cancer screening disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About half of the adults in the U.S. who should get screened for colorectal cancer do not get screened. Clinics that mail fecal tests to patients who are due for screening can increase screening rates and reduce screening disparities. With the goal of catching and treating cancers early, we will use a novel participatory approach to test reminders to a mailing program then test the spread of the program throughout a community clinic network.",Participatory Research to Advance Colon Cancer Prevention,9728735,U01MD010665,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Persons ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' farm worker ', ' farmworker ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' Instruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' Yakima Valley ', ' Text Messaging ', ' texting ', ' short message service ', ' screening program ', ' colon cancer prevention ', ' prevent colon cancer ', ' colon cancer screening ', ' detect colon cancer ', ' colon cancer detection ', ' patient portal ', ' screening disparities ', ' usual care arm ', ' usual care control group ', ' community clinic ', ' ']",NIMHD,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2019,464567,0.15593507223508793
"Salinomycin Targets Colorectal Cancer by Inhibiting Cancer Stem Cells and Telomerase PROJECT ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of death in most developed countries including the United States. The major cause of CRC patient death is by hepatic metastasis. Despite intensive studies, our knowledge about the nature of CRC metastasis cues and the mechanisms underlying their origination is still limited. Standard chemotherapy for CRC tumors relies on a number of cytotoxic drugs, targeted agents and their combinations. However, to date, we have no specific therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. There is an increasing need to develop alternative drugs targeting specific pathways that inhibit colorectal tumor growth and hepatic metastasis. The objective of this investigation is to develop salinomycin and MST-312 as novel therapeutic strategies for metastatic colorectal cancer. Salinomycin is a polyether antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces albus that acts as a potassium ionophore. Salinomycin possesses selective cancer stem cell inhibitory activity. We herein combine salinomycin with MST-312 for synergistic effects against metastasis. MST-312 (telomerase inhibitor IX) is a synthetic compound that acts as a telomerase inhibitor. Our central hypothesis is that dual targeting cancer stem cell and telomerase may synergize their anti-tumor effects and block hepatic metastasis via the eradication of colorectal cancer stem cells. We will test this hypothesis by performing the following specific aims. Aim 1: To determine whether hTERT signaling axis promotes the tumor initiation, drug resistance and metastatic potential of CD51+ colorectal cancer cells. Aim 2: To demonstrate that dual targeting CSCs and telomerase in colorectal cancer cells with salinomycin and MST- 312 significantly reduces cell invasiveness and stem cell-like traits compared to targeting CSCs and telomerase alone. Aim 3: To demonstrate in animal models that dual targeting with salinomycin and MST-312 inhibits the colon tumor proliferation and hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer xenografts compared to either agent alone. The results from the proposed experiments would expand our understanding of mechanisms of colon CSCs growth and metastasis inhibition resulting in a paradigm shift in treatment of CRC improving outcome for this deadly disease. Colorectal cancer (CRC), the incidence of which increases exponentially with aging, is the third deadliest cancer in the US. The high mortality is attributed to disease relapse and hepatic metastasis. Therefore, preventing metastasis would reduce poor treatment outcomes. To this end, we will target the telomerase and cancer stem cell populations which are playing important roles in colorectal cancer proliferation and metastasis. The primary goal of this investigation is to examine dual inhibition of telomerase and stemness as a novel therapeutic strategy for metastatic cancer. In addition, we will study experimental hepatic metastasis mechanism and metastasis blockade in an animal model. We expect that selective targeting telomerase and stemness offer a new therapeutic modality, and help to reduce health disparities from colorectal cancer.",Salinomycin Targets Colorectal Cancer by

"Developing a Barbershop-Based Trial on Masculinity Barriers to Care and Colorectal Cancer Screening Uptake among African-American Men using a Mixed Methods Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Charles R. Rogers, PhD, MPH, MS, CHES®’ long-term career goal is to become an independent researcher who utilizes community-based approaches to develop, implement, and evaluate culture-specific interventions to eliminate cancer disparities among African-American men. The training, research, and scholarship activities facilitated by this National Cancer Institute (NCI) Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01) will provide Dr. Rogers with the protected time to obtain the training essential for achieving his long-term career goal. The three key training areas for this K01 include instrument development and validation, mixed methods research, and intervention development and evaluation. A three-pronged approach has been developed by Rogers to reach his long-term career goal and complete his K01 plan, including: 1) a stellar team of interdisciplinary mentors and collaborators who will guide his research and career development; 2) an innovative research study integrated with his training goals that is both rigorous in its design and scientifically relevant; and 3) didactic coursework, professional exchanges, and workshops that build upon existing resources of the University of Minnesota Medical School and its NCI-designated Masonic Cancer Center. The purpose of Dr. Rogers’ research plan involves developing and pilot testing a theory-driven, culture-specific intervention that specifically targets masculinity barriers care and colorectal cancer (CRC) uptake among African-American men (ages 45-75). CRC is preventable as screening leads to identification and removal pre-cancerous polyps; however, African-American men consistently have the highest CRC mortality rates across all gender and racial/ethnic groups; and their CRC screening uptake remains low for uncertain reason. Contributing factors are etiologically complex, yet but culture-specific masculinity barriers to care may contribute to low CRC screening uptake among African-American men. Examining masculinity barriers to care is vital as CRC screening may challenge some cultural role expectations and self-representations of African-American men whose tendency is to delay help-seeking medical care. The study’s specific aims are to: 1) develop, validate, and test a culture- specific measure of masculinity barriers to care relative to CRC screening uptake among African-American men; and 2) develop and pilot test a theory-driven, culture-specific intervention that targets masculinity barriers to care, psychosocial factors, and CRC screening uptake among African-American men. Barbershops are historically known as culturally appropriate and trusted venues in African-American communities, and are critical for this research as they provide a pathway for reaching African-American men with masculinity barriers to care who are not regularly receiving healthcare services, and in particular, CRC screening. The proposed study and integrated training plan well-position Dr. Rogers to launch an independent investigator career focused on informing culture-specific interventions to eliminate cancer inequities among African-American men. PROJECT NARRATIVE African-American men have colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates 27% and 52% higher than non-Hispanic white men, and the highest rates among across all gender and racial/ethnic groups. Though contributing factors to CRC screening inequalities among African-American men are etiologically complex, few studies have examined the effects of masculinity barriers to care on CRC screening uptake among African- American men. This research proposes to design and pilot test a theory-driven, culture-specific intervention on masculinity barriers to care to improve CRC screening uptake among African-American men (ages 45-75).",Developing a Barbershop-Based Trial on Masculinity Barriers to Care and Colorectal Cancer Screening Uptake among African-American Men using a Mixed Methods Approach,9786695,K01CA234319,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Attitude ', ' Barbering ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cities ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Diagnosis ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Life Experience ', ' male ', ' role men ', ' male role ', "" Men's Role "", "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Perception ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Psychometrics ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Scholarship ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' sound ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Twins ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Inequality ', ' Sample Size ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Reporting ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' career development ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' survive cancer ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' systematic review ', ' pilot trial ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' stem ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' trial design ', ' University resources ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' recruit ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' cognitive interview ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2019,175673,0.21098126060867
"Transdisciplinary Team Science in Colorectal Cancer Prognosis: the ColoCare Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer will affect one in 20 individuals over the course of their lifetime. The ColoCare Study is a prospective cohort of men and women newly diagnosed with a first primary invasive colorectal cancer (stage I-IV) with repeat data and biospecimen collection beginning prior to surgery. The ColoCare Study was initiated at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center with subsequent consortium sites at the Moffitt Cancer Center, the German Cancer Research Center, and Huntsman Cancer Institute with institutional pilot/start-up funding to support patient recruitment. The goal of this study is to uniformly collet comprehensive sets of data and biospecimens from over 4000 multiethnic colorectal cancer patients at multiple time points (prior to surgery and 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post-surgery), including detailed treatment and risk factor data, fresh and fixed tumor and normal tissue, visceral adipose tissue, blood, stool, urine, saliva, and quantitative accelerometry data t assess physical activity. Each ColoCare Study site leverages existing infrastructure, including access to electronic medical records and NCI comprehensive/designated cancer center cores, while utilizing well-established protocols for recruitment, data collection, and biospecimen ascertainment that are consistently applied across all sites. Patients are followed up both actively and passively by study staff (in-person and through medical record reviews), as well as via linkages to cancer registry and vital status records. Currently, using pilot/institutional fund at four existing sites, we have recruited >1100 patients (n=1010 baseline bloods). With this infrastructure grant, we propose 1) to extend the ColoCare consortium to two new study centers that will enrich our numbers of underrepresented minority participants (University of Southern California, LA, and Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis) and 2) to continue and expand study procedures at all US sites, including energy balance assessments and molecular characterization of tumors. The support for expanded enrollment and continued follow-up of the ColoCare cohort will result in an estimated 4167 highly characterized enrollees. The repeat sampling of data and a diverse set of accompanying biospecimens at critical time points enables unprecedented epidemiologic and biomarker research that can inform clinical decision making and support evidence-based guidelines regarding lifestyle changes that impact outcomes. Additionally, we will establish an external advisory board and a community/participant advisory board to further guide infrastructure development and prioritize research use of this cohort. We will continue to participate in national and international consorti by contributing data and biospecimens. Support for this unique cohort of colorectal cancer patients will create a valuable resource for the broader research community. In-depth, repeated phenotyping within a single cohort will enable one-of-a-kind studies focused on the effects of health behaviors on prognosis, as well as the discovery of new biomarkers of clinically important outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    We propose to continue building and expanding the ColoCare Study, the only existing cohort of colorectal cancer patients for whom clinical data, information on health behaviors, and universal biospecimens have been systematically collected at repeat time points; ColoCare is uniquely suited for the discovery of new biomarkers of colorectal cancer treatment response and prognosis, as well as research that elucidates the influence of health behaviors on treatment efficacy and toxicity, quality-of-life, recurrence, and survival. We propose here to continue and augment collections at existing ColoCare sites, expand to two new sites that will focus on the recruitment of ethnic/racial minorities (over 4000 participants), and perform molecular characterization of tumor samples. This unique, multiethnic cohort will be an incredible resource for the broader research community, given its suitability for a wide-range of studies with potentially significant and near-term clinical

"Prediciting and addressing colonoscopy non-adherence in community settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. While research has shown that colorectal cancer screening decreases colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, only 65% of eligible adults were screened at the recommended interval in 2015. Even more troubling, those who are screened do not always get timely follow-up care for abnormal results. Dr. Lynn Butterly demonstrated that patient navigation can effectively raise rates of colonoscopy uptake among low-income, uninsured patients in New Hampshire, boosting rates 27 percentage points over usual care (96.2% vs 69.3%, P<.001). Using data from the STOP CRC study of 26 community clinics, our team developed a risk prediction model that can stratify patients according to their probability of adherence with follow-up colonoscopy. Our study will answer a key pragmatic question: can patient navigation effectively improve follow-up colonoscopy among patients who have a moderate or low probability of adhering to follow-up colonoscopy; and secondarily, does the effectiveness of patient navigation differ by patients’ probability level? We will build on our successful ongoing research to test a patient-level intervention, driven by the Chronic Care Model, to increase diagnostic follow-up for colorectal cancer screening. In Aim 1, we will validate the risk prediction model, stratify patients according to risk, and adapt patient navigation materials to local resources and settings. In Aim 2, we will conduct a two-arm randomized-controlled trial involving 28 clinics (~1200 patients with positive fecal tests) and will compare patient navigation and usual care in raising rates of follow-up colonoscopy. We will assess the effectiveness (completion of colonoscopy within 1 year) of the program overall, as well as the effectiveness by category of probability of adherence to follow-up colonoscopy (moderate vs. low). This large-scale, clinic-randomized, two-arm follow-up colonoscopy program among safety net patients will leverage the expertise of our research team, which has implemented numerous systems-based interventions in multiple health care settings and used electronic health record tools to deliver clinic-based interventions. We will build on these successes in undertaking the largest study to-date addressing follow-up colonoscopy uptake among patients who receive care in safety net clinics. This study could optimize the delivery of patient navigation, support the broad adoption of patient navigation programs, and greatly improve colonoscopy follow-up rates in this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Thousands of adults each year undergo screening for colorectal cancer through a fecal test, but those whose test results are positive do not always get timely follow-up colonoscopies. Our team has developed a model that can tell which patients are likely to get a follow-up colonoscopy, and we will use the model to test whether patient navigation can increase follow-up colonoscopy among patients who have a moderate or low probability of getting follow-up.

"Reducing Colorectal Cancer Health Disparities: An mHealth Intervention to Improve Screening among African American Men PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Poverty has a myriad of pernicious effects on health, including higher incidence and mortality for most forms of cancer. Colorectal cancer (CRC), the second overall leading cause of cancer death, is no exception. CRC is diagnosed 40% more often in those lower in socioeconomic status (SES). In the United States, race and SES are inextricably linked, leading to profound health disparities. Indeed, CRC is particularly burdensome for Black people; most notably African American men. CRC incidence is 20% higher in Black men as compared to white men with death rates 52% higher. African American men have the lowest survival rates at all CRC stages.  Because the precancerous polyps that cause most CRCs grow slowly, adherence to CRC screening can prevent most cases from becoming invasive cancer. Unfortunately, use of screening tests is inadequate, especially among low SES African American men. Indeed, 40% of the racial disparity in CRC incidence and 20% of the mortality differences can be attributed to lack of screening. Being Black, male, and low SES in the United States intersect to form a complex set of institutional, provider, and patient-level barriers that lead to these differential screening rates. Most existing approaches to increase CRC screening in this group utilize in- person or telephone-based education and patient navigation. While effective, these approaches are costly and resource intensive, limiting their adoption among organizations that primarily serve low SES African American men, such as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs).  To address the need for an effective, affordable, and scalable intervention to increase CRC screening among medically underserved African American men, this project will develop a theory-based, tailored, and culturally- targeted CRC screening mHealth intervention for this group. The proposed intervention will be based on the health belief model (HBM) and delivered via mobile phone. It will include text messages designed to improve CRC knowledge and health beliefs. Additionally, the program will present three web-based video components: scripted vignettes, unscripted peer narratives, and educational instruction. All program content will be designed to reduce health literacy barriers and promote adherence to CRC screening recommendations. Finally, it will be culturally targeted by contextualizing HBM constructs with the health beliefs most relevant to low SES African American men and by integrating gender- and race-congruent imagery, language, and values.  Eight FQHC staff members and 20 African American men will be recruited for focus group discussions to shape the proposed intervention. When a prototype version of the program is completed, 20 African American men who are nonadherent to CRC screening (i.e., target end-users) will be recruited for usability testing. The usability test will include a series of tasks intended to highlight the different features of the proposed intervention. Three usability metrics will be assessed: efficiency, accuracy, and subjective satisfaction. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop a mobile phone-based program designed to eliminate colorectal cancer disparities among medically underserved African American men. The proposed intervention is designed for use in Federally Qualified Health Centers and other clinics serving underinsured or uninsured patients. It can be integrated with electronic health records to identify primary care patients not compliant with colorectal cancer screening or deployed in the community via outreach workers.",Reducing Colorectal Cancer Health Disparities: An mHealth Intervention to Improve Screening among African American Men,9907523,R43CA246899,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Privacy ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Death Rate ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' non-compliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' non-compliant ', ' preference ', ' Familiarity ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Exclusion ', ' outreach ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Security ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' systematic review ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer invasiveness ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' medically underserved ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' prototype ', ' group intervention ', ' primary care setting ', ' screening ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' texting ', ' short message service ', ' intervention cost ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' patient barriers ', ' web-based assessment ', ' web-based screening ', ' screening guidelines ', ' screening recommendations ', ' recommended screening ', ' ']",NCI,"ISA ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2019,209611,0.24719901985364204
"Using audio and video brochures in a mail-based FIT outreach intervention PROJECT SUMMARY Our overall goal is to improve the completion of CRC (CRC) screening tests among mid-life adults (50-64 years of age) who reside in Appalachia. CRC screening tests are widely available, however many mid-life adults do not adhere to screening guidelines. Ohio ranks 31st and Kentucky ranks 24th among the United States (U.S.) for CRC screening adherence and CRC screening among Appalachian residents is lower than national standards. This factor likely contributes to the higher CRC incidence and mortality rates in Appalachian Ohio and Appalachian Kentucky compared to rates in the U.S. Because of these CRC disparities, the Appalachian region is included in one of three “hotspots” (spatial clusters of counties with unnecessarily high CRC mortality rates) identified in the U.S. that could benefit from CRC screening interventions. Factors contributing to CRC disparities among Appalachian residents include: lower socioeconomic status and educational attainment; limited health literacy; lifestyle factors; significant co-morbidities; health insurance issues; living in a rural area with inadequate public transportation; less access to healthcare; and lower CRC screening rates. Based on these screening data, lack of public transportation and the distance needed to travel for a colonoscopy in a rural region, and that annual CRC screening with fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is a recommended test option by the United States Preventive Service Task Force and the American Cancer Society, a mailed FIT intervention is a more viable strategy for Appalachian residents. While FIT outreach programs have been shown to increase CRC screening, many adults still do not complete a FIT mailed to their home (up to 70% non-completion in past studies). Common patient barriers to FIT completion include: lack of provider recommendation, perception of low CRC risk; concern about doing the test correctly; messiness with sample collection; concern about test results; forgetfulness; and embarrassment with specimen mailing. Importantly, many of these barriers may be addressed by materials (e.g. FIT instructions) sent with a FIT. However, a limitation of prior FIT outreach interventions has been including materials that are heavy in text and only supplemented with pictures, which may not be appropriate for individuals with limited health literacy. We will develop and pilot test two FIT outreach interventions that address this limitation and overcome other common CRC screening barriers. The interventions will use newer technology, audio or video brochures that include FIT instructions. Audio and video brochures incorporate audio or a video screen (with audio capabilities) surrounded by illustrations, pictures, and text. These brochures offer novel approaches for increasing FIT return by addressing common FIT barriers via targeted CRC screening information and FIT instructions appropriate for all health literacy skills. In addition, we will include disposable gloves in the interventions to address a common screening barrier, the perceived messiness associated with specimen collection. An established interdisciplinary team will use community-engaged research strategies to: Develop two mail- based FIT outreach interventions that use newer technology (audio brochure or video brochure) and disposable gloves in collaboration with Appalachian mid-life adults and healthcare providers (Aim 1); and Conduct a pilot study of the two developed mail-based FIT outreach interventions vs. mailed usual care materials to establish acceptability and obtain preliminary efficacy data on increasing CRC screening (Aim 2). Study findings will inform a future large randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the developed FIT outreach interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates are significantly higher and CRC screening rates are lower among mid-life adults (50-64 years old) living in Appalachian Ohio and Appalachian Kentucky compared to rates of mid-life adults living in the United States. Given that reducing CRC disparities is a public health priority, this proposal will develop and conduct a pilot study of two novel mail-based Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) outreach interventions that include an audio brochure or a video brochure and disposable gloves to increase CRC screening rates among Appalachian mid-life adults at average-risk for CRC.",Using audio and video brochures in a mail-based FIT outreach intervention,9649300,R21AG061496,"['Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' efficacy testing ', ' public health priorities ', ' screening ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' rurality ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' patient barriers ', ' colorectal cancer risk ', ' colo-rectal cancer risk ', ' screening guidelines ', ' screening recommendations ', ' recommended screening ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ', ' hereditary non-polyposis colo-rectal cancer ', ' Lynch Syndrome ', ' LS/HNPCC ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colo-rectal Neoplasms ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Defective Mismatch Repair Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Colorectal Endometrial Cancer Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Colo-rectal Endometrial Cancer Syndrome ', ' HNPCC ', ' Familial Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Kentucky ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' mortality ', ' Ohio ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' familial polyposis ', ' familial adenomatous polyposis ', ' Polyposis Coli ', ' Hereditary Adenomatous Polyposis Coli ', ' Familial Polyposis Syndrome ', ' Familial Polyposis Coli ', ' Familial Adenomatous Polyposis Syndrome ', ' Familial Adenomatous Polyposis Coli ', ' Adenomatous Polyposis of the Colon ', ' APC -

"Using Context to Improve Implementation of Evidenced-based Interventions for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Rural Primary Care (Precise CRC) PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Melinda Davis has a PhD in social developmental psychology and is a Research Assistant Professor in the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) School of Medicine (Department of Family Medicine) and Assistant Professor in the OHSU-PSU School of Public Health (Health Behavior). She is the Director of Community Engaged Research for the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN) at OHSU. This K07 builds upon her applied experience as a practice facilitator and participatory researcher, addresses critical gaps in scientific training, and provides pilot data for an R01 submission in year 3 in response to PAR-16-238. Guided by a multidisciplinary team of mentors, Dr. Davis will, through this K07, consolidate her skills in implementation science, mixed-methods, and cancer prevention and control. She will also secure her transition to research independence. Research Focus: Bridging the gap between knowledge of evidence based interventions (EBIs) and application in “real world” settings is a critical issue in cancer prevention and control research. Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, yet disparities exist for rural and low-income populations. Although direct mail (DM) programs can increase CRC screening rates by nearly 40%, this EBI is not yet routine practice. Moreover, implementation and intervention outcomes vary widely across settings. Research is needed to inform how best to scale DM programs and to support follow-up colonoscopy on positive fecal tests. Guided by the social ecological model and consolidated framework for implementation research we propose three aims:  Aim 1: Identify factors associated with higher levels of primary care practice readiness to implement direct  mail programs to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.  H1: Leadership culture and higher levels of adaptive reserve will be associated with readiness.  Aim 2: Pilot test tailored implementation support for a direct mail program in four rural primary care  practices clustered in one Medicaid Accountable Care Organization (ACO).  Aim 3: Elucidate barriers, facilitators, and adaptations to direct mail program components and the  associated impact on implementation and intervention outcomes. Training Goals: The training proposed fills critical gaps to enable Dr. Davis to conduct trials to improve the identification, adaptation, and implementation of EBIs to improve cancer prevention in rural primary care. The mentoring, training, and research aims ensure scientific growth in three areas: (1) Knowledge of advanced implementation science research methods; (2) Mixed methods research design and analysis; and (3) Leading multidisciplinary teams in cancer prevention and control. Environment: The OHSU Department of Family Medicine provides institutional support for this K07. Research and training activities also utilize the robust infrastructure of the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute (OCTRI), Knight Cancer Institute, and the Kaiser Permanente Northwest Center for Health Research. Methods: We will use an intervention mixed method design with embedded convergent and sequential components. To achieve Aim 1, we will conduct a multimodal (email, phone, in-person) survey of ORPRN practices (N~190), which are spread across Oregon's 16 Medicaid ACOs. We use generalized linear mixed models to identify factors associated with higher levels of readiness. To achieve Aim 2, we will use practice facilitation informed by the Getting to Outcomes™ approach, an evidence-based model that uses 10 steps to help organizations implement EBIs, to implement DM programs into four rural primary care clinics clustered in one Medicaid ACO (PacificSource Health Plans). We will assess the number of eligible patients reached (implementation outcomes) and the impact on CRC screening (intervention outcomes) and use a merging approach to cross-tabulate findings from clinic performance data with qualitative themes from observation visits and a baseline assessments of adaptive reserve and practice-readiness. In Aim 3, we will interview key informants from each practice (N~20) to identify DM program adaptations and elucidate barriers and facilitators to implementation. Outcomes: The training and research activities in this K07 fill critical gaps in scientific training for Dr. Davis. Findings provide essential pilot data on practice readiness, implementation strategies, and intervention adaptations which will inform an R01 submission in year 3 in response to PAR-16-238 to scale DM programs across rural clinics served by Oregon's Medicaid ACOs in a two arm pragmatic clinical trial. Findings address NCI agency priorities to implement EBIs and study multilevel interventions, help address long-standing CRC screening disparities, and propel Dr. Davis to research independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Colorectal cancer screening saves lives, yet over 40% of eligible adults have not been tested. This K07 explores the impact of multilevel interventions to improve colorectal cancer screening and treatment in rural and underserved patients and is designed to facilitate Dr. Davis' transition to research independence.

"Implementing multilevel colon cancer screening interventions to reduce rural cancer disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many rural communities are medically underserved and experience persistently elevated rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality relative to declining national rates. Routine screening reduces population CRC mortality, yet its impact is reduced because many adults who have an abnormal screening result with fecal testing do not receive diagnostic follow-up with colonoscopy. Rural residents and healthcare providers face unique barriers to screening follow-up including fewer providers who offer colonoscopy and longer travel distances to obtain healthcare. Rural Southern Illinois is a region with high poverty, slow economic growth, isolated households, widely dispersed medical care, and high CRC mortality. To reduce disparities in CRC mortality in rural areas where fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) is a common first-line screening strategy, we must identify effective, sustainable, and disseminable strategies to improve follow-up of positive screening tests. Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine have collaborated with Southern Illinois Healthcare, a rural not-for-profit health system, since 2015 to identify cancer prevention and control priorities and reduce disparities. From 2017 to 2018, we conducted a formal pre-implementation assessment of CRC screening and follow-up processes to identify feasible and promising evidence-based interventions and strategies for improvement. Based on our substantial and specific preliminary data, we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement a multilevel intervention of follow-up of abnormal colon cancer screening tests in primary care clinics across rural Southern Illinois. Using a stepped wedge trial design and cluster randomization, we will implement the multi-level intervention in 18 clinics. We will intervene at three levels (patients, providers/clinical teams, clinics) and evaluate implementation outcomes per Proctor's evaluation model using interviews, surveys, and field notes. Aim 2. Evaluate the impact of the multilevel intervention on follow-up of abnormal screening test results in rural primary care settings in Southern Illinois. Our stepped-wedge design will allow us to test the impact of the multi-level intervention on rates of screening follow-up. We measure outcomes at three levels. Patient: After positive FIT, receipt of referral and completion of colonoscopy. Primary Care Provider: Receipt of positive FIT results and referral for follow-up. Clinic-level: Patients with positive FIT complete colonoscopy. We will assess change in CRC screening rates and investigate interactions between and across levels. Data for primary outcomes will come from the healthcare system's ongoing patient registry that draws from electronic medical records and lab records. The co- construction of this proposal between university researchers and health system stakeholders enhances the potential for significant and sustainable change for effective and efficient screening and early detection. There is a critical need for real-world strategies that can function within rural community health systems to improve health and reduce disparities. NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer death. Screening is effective at reducing colorectal cancer mortality, but is limited when patients who screen positive do not receive complete diagnostic follow-up. This study tests a multi-level intervention to promote evaluation and follow-up of positive colorectal cancer screening tests in a rural area that is medically underserved and has high rates of colorectal cancer mortality compared to urban and suburban areas.",Implementing multilevel colon cancer screening interventions to reduce rural cancer disparities,9816436,R01CA233848,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Service area ', ' Health Catchment Area ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Household ', ' Illinois ', ' Incidence ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' Mississippi ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Records ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Process Measure ', ' Rural Community ', ' Caring ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' suburb ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Rural ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Rivers ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Clinic ', ' Test Result ', ' behavior change ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient registry ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Screening Result ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' tv watching ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' medically underserved ', ' implementation science ', ' primary care setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' screening ', ' trial design ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' rural healthcare ', ' rural health care ', ' rural dwellers ', ' rural resident ', ' rural underserved ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' colon cancer screening ', ' detect colon cancer ', ' colon cancer detection ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,487178,0.21157960238446033
"Reporting Nutrition Risk Factors via Virtual Humans for Colorectal Cancer Prevention. Project Summary Alcohol and red/processed meat consumption are two diet-related risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC). Informing patients of personal nutrition risk factors for CRC may help to stimulate accurate CRC risk perceptions and facilitate CRC prevention behaviors. For rural adults at risk for CRC, technology may help overcome disparities that affect CRC risk such as low screening rates, poor diet, low literacy, and limited access to healthcare. This diversity supplement is connected to an R01 awarded to Dr. Janice Krieger (1R01CA207689-01A1) titled “A Patient-Centered Intervention using Technology to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Disparities in Primary Care”. This proposed diversity supplement adds a nutrition module delivered in a virtual environment to enhance the personal relevancy of CRC risk information and encourage CRC prevention behaviors in two ways. First, virtual health assistants (VHAs) will collect patient reported outcomes (PROs) specific to alcohol and red/processed meat consumption. Second, VHAs will present participants with personalized nutritional risk information using visual and graphic content. Focus groups and think-aloud interviews with rural adults between the ages of 50-73 years old will ensure the nutrition module is culturally and socially relevant and presents appropriate content and messages. Focus groups will use storyboards to depict components of the planned nutrition module that will be added to the existing CRC screening intervention. Using an iterative approach, we will modify the nutrition module to include an interactive and visually engaging process of reporting and receiving tailored feedback for alcohol and meat consumption in the virtual environment. We will then test the nutrition module for usability with think-aloud interviews. We will pilot test the intervention among black and white rural adults. We will use a pre-post, 3-group randomization with participants receiving the VHA-delivered tailored nutrition module (n=30), text-based tailored nutrition module (n=30), or attention control module (n=30) on a web-enabled computer or tablet. We will test if the intervention increases 1) accurate CRC risk perceptions, 2) intentions to screen for CRC 3) and information seeking behaviors to reduce alcohol and red/processed meat intake compared to the tailored text-based nutrition module or attention control condition. This project builds upon prior and ongoing work that leverages virtual human technology to increase CRC screening among rural populations and racial minorities. We test if patient engagement with nutrition risk factors delivered in a virtual setting can stimulate accurate risk perceptions and promote CRC prevention behaviors. Findings will inform optimal message design for CRC prevention and test the impact of concreate representations of risk on CRC prevention goals. Long-term, the goal of this work is to integrate the nutrition module within healthcare systems to facilitate collection of nutrition PROs for CRC prevention. The CRC intervention and nutrition module delivered with virtual human technology is a scalable and affordable intervention with potential to increase screening rates in rural and underserved areas. Project Narrative This project uses insights from rural adults to inform an interactive nutrition module for use in an existing colorectal cancer (CRC) screening intervention. This is the first project that uses virtual health assistants to collect nutritional risk factors for CRC as patient reported outcomes (PROs) that can integrate into the electronic health record. Outcomes will contribute to knowledge of what message design components are effective at stimulating accurate CRC risk perceptions and promoting screening behaviors among rural adults.",Reporting Nutrition Risk Factors via Virtual Humans for Colorectal Cancer Prevention.,9828827,R01CA207689,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Counseling ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' Meat ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Population ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' nutrition education ', ' diet education ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' prevent colorectal cancer ', ' prevent colo-rectal cancer ', ' colo-rectal cancer prevention ', ' CRC prevention ', ' Knowledge ', ' Nutritional status ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Reaction ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' information seeking behavior ', ' visual feedback ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' risk perception ', ' virtual reality ', ' virtual world ', ' virtual environment ', ' VR simulation ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence ', ' Biomarker of Dietary Intake ', ' Intake ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Cancer and Nutrition ', ' Collection ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Text ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' post intervention ', ' virtual ', ' virtual human ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' web-enabled ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' tailored messaging ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' parent project ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' attentional control ', ' racial minority ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' Processed Meats ', ' rural patients ', ' rural underserved ', ' colorectal cancer risk ', ' colo-rectal cancer risk ', ' patient engagement ', ' dietary guidelines ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2019,50435,0.2479332231450525
"A Multilevel CBPR Intervention to Improve Colorectal Cancer Screening in Underserved Vietnamese Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third highest cause of mortality in Vietnamese and Asian Americans. CRC incidence is rising rapidly in Vietnamese Americans, but they have among the lowest rates of CRC screening (14%) and are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease, which is highly preventable. Over 85% of Vietnamese Americans in our region (PA, NJ and NYC) are foreign-born with limited English proficiency, have low SES, and live in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Many lack knowledge about CRC risks and screening benefits, and have limited access to culturally appropriate preventive care. Thus, a multilevel intervention is needed to address the multiple barriers to and determinants of CRC screening in this community. Vietnamese community organizations (VCOs) serve dynamic social functions and represent an important resource for addressing this critical health disparity priority by promoting CRC screening. This project builds on established partnerships and successful work of Center for Asian Health, Temple University with Vietnamese CBOs that address their critical health disparities. CBPR principles will be applied to engage 20 VCOs in all phases of planning, implementing, evaluating, and disseminating a culturally appropriate, theory- and evidence-based multilevel CRC intervention. The proposed intervention will be guided by Social Ecological Model, which addresses sociocultural, behavioral and environmental determinants and intervention strategies at individual, interpersonal, and community organizational levels. CDC's Clinical Preventive Services Guidelines for adults 50+ (CPS) recommend that cancer screenings and other preventive services should be promoted. The standard CPS will be provided to both intervention and control groups, and intervention group will receive CPS + multilevel CRC intervention. Specific Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that CPS + multilevel CRC intervention will yield higher CRC screening rates compared to CPS control at 12-month follow up; Aim 2 is to examine whether CPS + multilevel CRC intervention (which includes CHW-led group education, automated and interactive text messaging and phone-based peer support) is more effective in changing screening determinants (e.g. KAB, self-efficacy, risk factors, lifestyles, social support, social norms, access barriers) than CPS control condition; and Aim 3 is to assess costs and cost-effectiveness of CPS + multilevel CRC intervention compared to CPS control condition in relation to CRC screening rates in order to inform future dissemination efforts. In sum, this project represents the first large-scale community-based randomized controlled trial of a multilevel, culturally-appropriate CBPR intervention to increase CRC screening among underserved Vietnamese. If effective, this innovative multilevel CRC intervention can be used as a model program that has potential generalizability and sustainability in Asian American and other underserved ethnic communities to impact preventive behaviors at population level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in Vietnamese Americans (VAs) but they have among the lowest rates of CRC screening (14%) and are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease, which is highly preventable. Although promoting preventive care for at-risk populations is a public health priority, little is known about effective CRC screening intervention for the fast-growing and undeserved VAs and this project aims to determine the effectiveness of a multilevel, theory- and evidence- based CBPR intervention to increase CRC screening in underserved VAs. This innovative multilevel intervention is the first of its kind in the US that is tailored to the speciic needs, characteristics and assets of this disparity population, and has potential

"Normative Messages to Promote Colorectal Cancer Screening Uptake among African Americans Project Summary/Abstract  Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in the United States for both men and women. Despite gains in CRC survival, African Americans (AAs) still fare worse in CRC incidence and mortality compared to European Americans (EA). Given that CRC incidence and mortality are directly related to CRC screening, this disparity can be attributed to the corresponding screening disparity wherein AAs are less likely to attend CRC screening compared to EAs. It follows that interventions to increase CRC screening intentions and subsequent CRC screening behaviors among AAs are instrumental in addressing the disparities in CRC incidence and mortality. Video-based interventions have been used effectively in a number of CRC screening interventions aimed at AAs’ CRC screening knowledge and behaviors. Additionally, interventions that target individuals’ perceptions of behavioral norms have successfully influenced people’s engagement across a number of health behaviors; however, despite their promise, norm- based messages have not been utilized for CRC screening interventions with AAs. For the current study we will use an experimental design to examine the extent to which injunctive and descriptive norm messages about CRC screening influence AAs’ normative perceptions and CRC screening intentions. We will also examine the extent to which racial identity and group-based medical mistrust moderate the effects of norm messages. Finally, we will explore the effects of norm messaging on CRC screening uptake. We will test the following specific aims:  Aim 1: To (a) examine the unique effects of injunctive norm and descriptive norm messages on normative perceptions, CRC screening intentions, and (b) to explore whether the norm-messages foment stronger association between normative expectations and CRC screening intentions among a cohort of screen eligible AAs. We will recruit participants who are non-compliant with CRC screening.  Aim 2: To (a) examine the moderating roles of racial identity and group-based medical mistrust and (b) explore the moderating role of perceptions of barriers and behavioral control on the effects of normative messaging. We will examine whether norm-based messages lead to more favorable normative perceptions and stronger effects of normative perceptions, among participants who more strongly identify as AAs, who harbor greater group-based medical mistrust and who perceive fewer behavioral impediments.  Aim 3: To explore the effects of injunctive and descriptive norm messages on CRC screening uptake. We will explore whether participants who receive the norm-based interventions are more likely to request a CRC screening kit, and more likely to return the CRC screening kit, compared to participants who do not receive the intervention. Project Narrative  Disparities in colorectal cancer screening for African Americans (i.e., fewer African Americans screened relative to European Americans) are directly related to the disparities in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality faced by African Americans (i.e., more African American being diagnosed with and dying from colorectal cancer). The current study tests the extent to which messages that target African Americans’ perceptions of colorectal cancer screening behavioral norms influence screening intentions and behaviors.",Normative Messages to Promote Colorectal Cancer Screening Uptake among African Americans,9770813,R03CA216011,"['Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Influentials ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Probability ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Route ', ' non-compliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' non-compliant ', ' American ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cognitive ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial identity ', ' cancer survival ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' recruit ', ' screening disparities ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,77000,0.2865804655156274
"(ACCSIS) Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia This multi-site project aims to increase screening and follow-up for colorectal cancer (CRC) in central Appalachia, a medically underserved region recognized as one of three distinct “hotspots” for CRC mortality. Specifically, the Appalachian Regional Commission classifies 32 eastern Ohio (OH) counties and the 54 counties in eastern Kentucky (KY) as north central and central Appalachia, respectively. CRC incidence and mortality rates in the area are among the highest in the nation, and neither state meets the national target of 80% of eligible residents screened for CRC. There have been few randomized intervention trials addressing multiple levels of influence on CRC screening behaviors and outcomes in this region. To address this gap, investigators at the University of Kentucky and The Ohio State University will build on a 12-year collaborative history, strong relationships with Appalachian communities and health clinics, and extensive experience with community-based cancer prevention and control intervention research to develop, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention (MLI) – adapted from evidence-based interventions that include components targeting clinics and providers (in-reach) and the community (outreach) – to increase CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care among patients age 50-74 in 12 counties in Appalachian KY and OH. The overall goals of this project are to contribute to the evidence-base for a MLI that increases rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care, particularly in rural, medically underserved populations, and help showcase best practices for how MLIs can be scaled-up to reduce the burden of CRC in the U.S. For the Planning-Exploratory Phase (UG3) in Year 1, our specific aims are to: 1) Pilot test, measure, and refine a MLI to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care in Appalachian OH and Appalachian KY; and 2) Provide evidence supporting transition to the Implementation Phase (UH3) [per NCI approval]. For the Implementation Phase (UH4) in Years 2-5, our specific aims are to: 1) Test the revised MLI in a group randomized trial, delayed intervention to assess the impact of the MLI on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among Appalachian KY and Appalachian OH populations; and 2) Assess dissemination and sustainability of the intervention. The project will be implemented in collaboration with community and clinical partners in 12 counties, 6 in Ohio and 6 in Kentucky. Counties will be randomized to early or delayed intervention after baseline data collection. The main outcome will be CRC screening as defined by US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines and measured by clinic electronic health records and county- level behavioral assessments using random digit dialed telephone surveys similar to CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Our work will be accomplished through collaboration with the ACCSIS Coordinating Center, other ACCSIS Research Projects, ACCSIS Steering Committee and Workgroups, NCI, and community partners. If effective, this MLI will be disseminated to our clinical and community partners throughout Appalachia. This project will implement and evaluate community and clinical interventions designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer in Appalachian regions of Ohio and Kentucky. The first year of the project will develop and refine the interventions to be implemented and tested in the next 4 years. Results will showcase best practices for how multilevel interventions can be scaled-up to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer in the U.S.",(ACCSIS) Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia,9997414,UH3CA233282,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Area Health Education Centers ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Kentucky ', ' Low Income Population ', ' mortality ', ' Ohio ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Savings ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Administrator ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Rural Community ', ' Caring ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Trust ', ' Rural ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' uptake ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' experience ', ' Localized Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Localized Malignancy ', ' Localized Cancer ', ' Local Cancer ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' Provider ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Address ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' safety net ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' medically underserved ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' screening ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' community clinic ', ' Rural Appalachia ', ' Rural Appalachian ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,UH3,2019,1262419,0.3082283123888368
"Screening More patients for CRC through Adapting and Refining Targeted Evidence-based Interventions in Rural settings (SMARTER CRC) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: This two-phase project is designed to achieve the Cancer Moonshot objectives by reducing the burden of CRC on the US population. Specifically, we aim to improve CRC screening rates, follow-up colonoscopy, and referral to care in rural Medicaid patients by implementing a direct mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach and patient navigation for follow-up colonoscopy. We leverage partnerships with the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Kaiser Northwest Center for Health Research, and Medicaid Health Plans and deliver training and implementation support to participating rural primary care clinics using practice facilitation. In total, we anticipate working with 30 organizations to facilitate implementation with 130 primary care clinics (reaching 17,000+ rural Medicaid patients). In Phase I (Year 01), we will conduct a milestone driven pilot to build the necessary infrastructure for a large-scale implementation-effectiveness trial, including adapting the clinic-health plan-vendor supported direct mail program for rural Medicaid patients that have not established care and/or never been screened; conducting a pilot study testing the feasibility and acceptability of patient navigation to support follow-up colonoscopy following an abnormal fecal test; engaging Medicaid Health Plans and recruiting 30 primary care clinics located in rural and frontier counties in Oregon; and developing the training and support materials needed to implement a large-scale trial in these settings. In Phase II (Years 02-05), we will conduct an implementation-effectiveness study using a quasi- experimental stepped wedge design in 30 rural primary care clinics using program training and practice facilitation to support implementation. As in the pilot, the intervention combines: (1) a clinic-health plan- vendor supported direct-mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach for patients who have never been screened or who have yet to establish care and (2) patient navigation for those who are referred for colonoscopy as either the primary screening or for follow-up from an abnormal fecal test. We will evaluate effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention through quantitative and qualitative measures. Results from the implementation study will inform scale-up of the program through partnerships with 20 regional and national organizations that serve rural/frontier primary care clinics using webinars, train-the-trainer workshops and collaborative learning activities using the ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) model. PROJECT NARRATIVE Disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, follow-up, and referral to care exist in rural communities and for sub-populations within (e.g., Medicaid enrollees, Hispanic patients). In SMARTER CRC, our multidisciplinary team will adapt, pilot, then test the implementation and scale-up of targeted direct-mail and patient navigation programs – two effective multicomponent interventions – in partnership with rural clinics, health plans (payers), and commercial vendors. Our approach leverages an established rural practice-based research network; addresses patient, clinic, and community level factors; and will ultimately reduce CRC disparities in rural Medicaid patients and support Biden's Cancer Moonshot objectives.",Screening More patients for CRC through Adapting and Refining Targeted Evidence-based Interventions in Rural settings (SMARTER CRC),9868743,UG3CA244298,"['Rural ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Native Americans ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' outreach ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient registry ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' practice-based research network ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' implementation trial ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' aged ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' screening ', ' colon cancer patients ', ' colorectal cancer patients ', ' colo-rectal cancer patients ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' program dissemination ', ' project dissemination ', ' webinar ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' frontier counties ', ' rural environment ', ' rural counties ', ' rural underserved ', ' rural setting ', ' rural place ', ' rural locality ', ' recruit ', ' health plan ', ' health plans ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' patient engagement ', ' patient outreach ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' screening disparities ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' endoscopic imaging ', ' Endoscopy ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Oregon ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Population ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training Support ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Vendor ', ' Measures ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Rural Community ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Caring ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' ']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,UG3,2019,644131,0.09715626751270276
"A patient-centered intervention using virtual technology to reduce colorectal cancer disparities in primary care PROJECT ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Unfortunately, there are significant CRC screening disparities that result in higher rates of CRC-related morbidity and mortality for minority and rural patient populations, particularly in the southern United States. The development of interventions that capitalize on advances in communication, informatics, and computer science have great promise for resolving theoretical and practical problems associated with CRC screening decision-making. The purpose of this proposal is to test the efficacy of a patient-centered, tailored message intervention delivered via virtual technology for increasing CRC screening within guidelines among racial/ethnic minority and rural patients. We hypothesize that exposure to a minimally tailored CRC screening intervention delivered via VHT will lead to improved cognitive processing of the intervention and increased adherence with initial and repeated annual FIT screening completion as compared to a fully tailored, text-only intervention. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct focus groups and think-aloud interviews stratified by geography, gender, and racial/ethnic background to expand and pilot test an intervention that uses a virtual human as a delivery mechanism for CRC screening information. In Specific Aim 2, patients (N = 3,000) will be recruited via primary care clinics and a secure, clinical data warehouse to complete a patient- randomized test of the efficacy of the intervention for promoting initial and repeat FIT testing. Dependent measures will be assessed via patient self-report and chart review. The proposed study will reduce health disparities and associated morbidity and mortality due to CRC via increasing screening among racial/ethnic minority and rural populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE A primary goal of Healthy People 2020 is to increase the percentage of individuals screened for colorectal cancer (CRC) across population subgroups to 80%. The proposed study will reduce health disparities and associated morbidity and mortality due to CRC by increasing FIT screening among racial/ethnic minorities and rural patients through a novel, culturally sensitive intervention.",A patient-centered intervention using virtual technology to reduce colorectal cancer disparities in primary care,9645058,R01CA207689,"['Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Rural Population ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Individual ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Exposure to ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' computer science ', ' Informatics ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Appearance ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient registry ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' cost ', ' virtual human ', ' Minority ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' web-enabled ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' tailored messaging ', ' usability ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' prototype ', ' patient population ', ' efficacy testing ', ' clinical data warehouse ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' personalized screening ', ' precision screening ', ' rural patients ', ' recruit ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' patient barriers ', ' patient engagement ', ' screening disparities ', ' Infrastructure ', ' virtual technology ', ' screening guidelines ', ' screening recommendations ', ' recommended screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2019,588508,0.3155099810058364
"Optimizing Colorectal Cancer Screening PREcision and Outcomes in CommunIty-baSEd Populations (PRECISE) Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Most deaths are preventable through early detection, but failures of screening completion and quality substantially impair test effectiveness. This proposal unites the productive PROSPR I CRC Centers into a single collaboration to address key questions and pilot interventions to improve CRC screening outcomes. In PROSPR I, we developed a strong transdisciplinary, multisite collaboration. We collected 316 data elements, performed validation studies, created high-quality pooled data sets to identify patient, provider, and system gaps in the CRC screening process factors and published >60 manuscripts. Our unified PROSPR II Research Center (PRC) will use these proven collaborations and >10 years of longitudinal data for >8.9 million screen-eligible people (~ 1 of 40 eligible people in the US), large numbers of screening exposures (>8.4 million fecal immunochemical tests [FIT] and >1.9 million colonoscopies), and outcomes (>28,000 CRCs). Our PRC is geographically, demographically and economically diverse (three states, >800,000 African Americans, 1.6 million Hispanics, and 1 million Asian Americans). The health systems have different CRC screening patterns, different modalities, and include all major insurance/reimbursement methods (safety net, Medicare, Medicaid, high-deductible and pre-paid/fee-for-service, staff-model and incentivized providers).  Our PROSPR I research identified major deficiencies in three areas of CRC screening: who should get screening and surveillance and when; why people do not complete recommended screening, surveillance or follow-up of positive tests; and how test quality and accuracy can be improved. Project 1 will identify on whom and when screening should be performed, particularly for those with conflicting recommendations (e.g., African Americans aged 40-49 years, and patients 76-85 years old). Project 2 will evaluate when surveillance should occur after a precancerous polyp diagnosis, using baseline colonoscopy results and precise new 10-year risk estimates for CRC. Project 3 will explore long-term screening patterns and multilevel drivers of why screening and surveillance are not appropriately completed, especially in understudied patients who never screen, fail to re-screen, use surveillance inappropriately or fail to follow up after a positive screening test. Project 4 will evaluate how to increase the effectiveness of FIT and colonoscopy by optimizing age- and sex-stratified quantitative FIT abnormal ranges, establishing precise adenoma detection thresholds for quality improvement and evaluating drivers of adenoma detection. We will use results from these observational studies, behavioral science methods, and stakeholder involvement to develop and pilot test multilevel interventions. Our transdisciplinary team of scientists, physicians, and healthcare experts will also provide leadership and data for trans-PROSPR, multiple-organ collaborations. The proposed research can substantially decrease the burden of CRC by reducing disparities and identifying ways to improve screening completion and effectiveness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Screening can reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in clinical trials. However, the real practice of screening in different community based populations differs from what can be achieved in trials. Optimizing screening strategies by characterizing potential failures of the screening process, improving the accuracy of screening tests, developing screening strategies tailored to personal risk and identifying ways to help more people complete screening offers substantial potential for decreasing colorectal cancer deaths.",Optimizing Colorectal Cancer Screening PREcision and Outcomes in CommunIty-baSEd Populations (PRECISE),9685173,UM1CA222035,"['adenoma ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Consultations ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Deductibles ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Incentives ', ' Incidence ', ' Insurance ', ' Leadership ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Polyps ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' human very old age (85+) ', ' aged 85 and older ', ' aged 85 and greater ', ' age 85 and older ', ' age 85 and greater ', ' 85+ years old ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Fees for Service ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Polypectomy ', ' PLYPCMY ', ' Colorectal ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Manuscripts ', ' validation studies ', ' Modality ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Detection ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', ' safety net ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' screening ', ' colon cancer patients ', ' colorectal cancer patients ', ' colo-rectal cancer patients ', ' personalized screening ', ' precision screening ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' colorectal cancer risk ', ' colo-rectal cancer risk ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' screening guidelines ', ' screening recommendations ', ' recommended screening ', ' ']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,UM1,2019,3742781,0.26455630864600027
"Risk and Protective Factors Associated with AD/ADRD and CRC Among the High-Risk Low-Income Asian American Elderly ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third highest cause of mortality in Vietnamese and Asian Americans. CRC incidence is rising rapidly in Vietnamese Americans, but they have among the lowest rates of CRC screening (14%) and are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease, which is highly preventable. Over 85% of Vietnamese Americans in our region (PA, NJ and NYC) are foreign-born with limited English proficiency, have low SES, and live in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Many lack knowledge about CRC risks and screening benefits, and have limited access to culturally appropriate preventive care. Thus, a multilevel intervention is needed to address the multiple barriers to and determinants of CRC screening in this community. Vietnamese community organizations (VCOs) serve dynamic social functions and represent an important resource for addressing this critical health disparity priority by promoting CRC screening. This project builds on established partnerships and successful work of Center for Asian Health, Temple University with Vietnamese CBOs that address their critical health disparities. CBPR principles will be applied to engage 20 VCOs in all phases of planning, implementing, evaluating, and disseminating a culturally appropriate, theory- and evidence-based multilevel CRC intervention. The proposed intervention will be guided by Social Ecological Model, which addresses sociocultural, behavioral and environmental determinants and intervention strategies at individual, interpersonal, and community organizational levels. CDC's Clinical Preventive Services Guidelines for adults 50+ (CPS) recommend that cancer screenings and other preventive services should be promoted. The standard CPS will be provided to both intervention and control groups, and intervention group will receive CPS + multilevel CRC intervention. Specific Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that CPS + multilevel CRC intervention will yield higher CRC screening rates compared to CPS control at 12-month follow up; Aim 2 is to examine whether CPS + multilevel CRC intervention (which includes CHW-led group education, automated and interactive text messaging and phone-based peer support) is more effective in changing screening determinants (e.g. KAB, self-efficacy, risk factors, lifestyles, social support, social norms, access barriers) than CPS control condition; and Aim 3 is to assess costs and cost-effectiveness of CPS + multilevel CRC intervention compared to CPS control condition in relation to CRC screening rates in order to inform future dissemination efforts. In sum, this project represents the first large-scale community-based randomized controlled trial of a multilevel, culturally-appropriate CBPR intervention to increase CRC screening among underserved Vietnamese. If effective, this innovative multilevel CRC intervention can be used as a model program that has potential generalizability and sustainability in Asian American and other underserved ethnic communities to impact preventive behaviors at population level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in Vietnamese Americans (VAs) but they have among the lowest rates of CRC screening (14%) and are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease, which is highly preventable. Although promoting preventive care for at-risk populations is a public health priority, little is known about effective CRC screening intervention for the fast-growing and undeserved VAs and this project aims to determine the effectiveness of a multilevel, theory- and evidence- based CBPR intervention to increase CRC screening in underserved VAs. This innovative multilevel intervention is the first of its kind in the US that is tailored to the speciic needs, characteristics and assets of this disparity population, and has potential generalizability and sustainability in Asian American and other underserved ethnic communities to impact preventive behaviors at population level.",Risk and Protective Factors Associated with AD/ADRD

"MUC13 Mucin in Colerectal Cancer Health Disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most lethal malignancy in the USA and affects over a million people every year. A significant CRC health disparity exists between African Americans (AA), American Indians (AI) and Caucasians (CA) in relation to its occurrence, drug response and mortality. Due to this, the overall mortality is highr among AA/AI compared to CA. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this disparity in AA/AI are not known. Therefore, it is highly imperative to understand the molecular basis and the identification of biomarker(s) that can be used for early stage diagnosis, metastasis and drug response to reduce this unacceptable health disparity. Our laboratory has identified a novel transmembrane mucin, MUC13, which is highly overexpressed/aberrantly localized in CRC and is involved in its pathogenesis. Additionally, our recent preliminary data suggest a markedly higher and aberrant expression of MUC13 in AA/AI CRC samples compared to CA counter parts. We have shown that MUC13 is an important modulator of several signal-transduction pathways and affects multiple key proteins involved in cell growth and survival, such as sonic hedgehog, HER2 and p53. Our published and preliminary studies have suggested an aberrant expression of MUC13 which has implications in CRC progression and metastasis. Based on these compelling evidence, we hypothesize that the differential/aberrant expression of MUC13 and/or MUC13 variants are underlying factors associated with CRC health disparity. In addition, we hypothesize this differential MUC13 expression is regulated by certain microRNAs (miR-145 and miR-132) and inflammatory mediators produced by the tumor microenvironment (e.g. interleukin-6 mediated STAT5B phosphorylation) resulting in malignant colorectal cancer cells phenotypes among AA/AI populations. Three specific aims with comprehensive experimental approach are proposed to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we propose to study the expression profile of MUC13 in Caucasians, African Americans and American Indians CRC tissues and its correlation with disease progression, metastasis and patient survival. Aim 2 will investigate the presence of MUC13 spliced variants/single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their association with chemoresistance, metastasis and CRC health disparity. Aim 3 intends to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of MUC13 regulation in clinically relevant CRC tissues and cell line models. We will also investigate how various intrinsic factors can induce aberrant/ altered subcellular localization of MUC13, in clinically relevant CRC cell line models, as aberrant subcellular localization (cytoplasmic, nuclear) of MUC13 has also been associated with disease stage, prognosis and metastasis. The results of this multi factorial study will determine if MUC13 can be used as a molecular signature for early detection of aggressive and metastatic CRC in AA and AI. This comprehensive study will further provide important insights regarding MUC13 etiology in CRC and help in designing preventive and therapeutic strategies to reduce CRC mortality and CRC health disparity in underserved populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Underserved populations such as African Americans (AA) and American Indians (AI) are experiencing increasing prevalence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC), thus understanding the molecular basis of this disparity and the identification of molecular signatures that can be used for early stage diagnosis are highly desirable. This study will determine the role of MUC13, its variants/SNPs and its regulators (miRNAs, transcription factors and cytokines) in early diagnosis and disease progression and metastasis. Proposed study will provide important insights regarding MUC13 etiology in CRC and help in designing preventive and therapeutic strategies to lower CRC mortality and reduce the CRC health disparity in these highly underserved populations.",MUC13 Mucin in Colerectal Cancer Health Disparity,9997289,R01CA204552,"['Affect ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cytoplasm ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' Intrinsic factor ', ' Laboratories ', ' mortality ', ' Mucus Glycoprotein ', ' Mucins ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' cytokine ', ' p53 Genes ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' TRP53 ', ' TP53 ', ' P53 ', ' TP53 gene ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Signal Transduction Pathway ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Malignant -

"Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions to Improve Screening Among Rural Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2014 approximately 310,030 women in the United States (U.S.) will be diagnosed with breast cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CC), or colorectal cancer (CRC), and 68,060 women will die from these cancers. These three cancers account for 39% of the cancer burden and 25% of the cancer mortality among women in the U.S. Although effective screening tests are widely available for all three cancers, many women do not adhere to screening guidelines. Furthermore, the burden of these cancers is higher among some population groups and regions. Thirty-two rural counties in northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana share similar socioeconomically underserved populations of predominately (96.2%) white women who have elevated BC, CRC, and CC mortality rates, and lower screening rates with mammography, Pap tests, and fecal occult blood testing or colonoscopy. No known intervention has addressed improving screening rates for these three main female cancers simultaneously, even though multiple health behavior change research is emerging as a new model to change the way in which interventions can be packaged. The proposed project uses an overall theoretical framework to understand health disparities which includes individual, social and community level variables, and a conceptual model for the intervention which uses a multiple behavior theoretical approach, all of which have demonstrated efficacy in improving adherence to single screening test behaviors, as well as other preventive health behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to test the comparative effectiveness of a tailored interactive computer program delivered via DVD (TIDVD) vs. a TIDVD + telephone-based patient navigation (PN) intervention (TNI) vs. Usual Care (UC) to increase guideline-based screening rates for BC, CC, and CRC among women age 50 to 74 living in these rural counties of Ohio and Indiana. Specific aims are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of a tailored and interactive DVD (TIDVD) vs. TIDVD + telephone-based PN intervention (TNI) vs. UC, to increase guideline-based cancer screening rates at 12 months post randomization for BC, CC, and CRC among 1058 women age 50 to 74 living in rural northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana; and 2) compare the cost effectiveness of the TIDVD and the TIDVD + TNI intervention vs. UC, for adherence to each screening outcome or combination of screening tests. As an Exploratory Aim, we will identify associations between theoretical variables (community, social, and individual) and screening outcomes, including interactions with the interventions. If found to be cost effective, either or both interventions hae the potential to be immediately disseminated to increase BC, CC, and CRC screening rates and ultimately reduce cancer disparities for underserved rural women.

"The Interplay of Behavior, Environment, and Microbiota in Colorectal Cancer Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Tiffany Carson is an applied epidemiologist with a background in studying health disparities of black and white women. Dr. Carson's early work focused on behaviors related to diet, physical activity, obesity and related health outcomes. Recently, Dr. Carson has focused on applying her research efforts to better understand cancer disparities of black and white women. Dr. Carson's overarching career goal is to become an independently funded investigator and develop evidence-based bio-behavioral interventions to reduce cancer health disparities. To that end, this application proposes a rigorous research project and training plan focused on investigating the microbiota as a novel potential contributor to colorectal cancer (CRC) disparities between black and white women. CRC is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the United States    accounting for 9% of cancer deaths. Known risk factors for CRC include increasing age, male sex, family history, inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical inactivity, high consumption of red and processed meats and high fat diet, and obesity. Among women, even after accounting for differences in the distribution of risk factors, black women remain at 48% greater risk for CRC than white women. There is a growing body of research suggesting that the influence of diet on CRC risk is mediated through the microbiota and that microbial perturbations caused by diet, lifestyle, and antibiotics can lead to increased risk for CRC and other chronic diseases. Stress is one factor that has been shown to lead to alterations in the microbiota. Our research has shown that black women report moderate to high stress levels and additional published literature indicates that black women report higher stress levels than their white counterparts. These observations have lead to our hypothesis that a greater proportion of black women have a perturbed microbiota as a result of higher stress levels compared to white women, putting black women at greater risk for developing CRC. In the present proposal, we plan to explore this hypothesis employing a case control study design comparing the following groups: 1) black and white women with incident CRC from the Kirklin Clinic at UAB and 2) age-matched cancer-free black and white female community controls. Specifically, we will first characterize the oral and gut microbiota of black and white women with CRC and compare by race with particular focus on microbes known to be either positively or negatively associated with CRC. Because all cases will have CRC, we hypothesize that there will be no significant racial differences in the microbiota or other known risk factors for CRC such as diet. In contrast, when we repeat this experiment in cancer-free black and white female community controls, we expect to observe racial differences in the microbiota, with black women having less health-promoting bacteria and more pathogenic bacteria than white women, which would put black women at increased risk for CRC. We anticipate that a greater proportion of black females in the control group will have microbiota that resembles the microbiota of participants with CRC. Additionally, if our hypothesis is supported, psychological stress with be inversely associated with health-promoting bacteria and positively associated with pathogenic bacteria. Our findings will provide insight into how lifestyle factors that have not been fully explored to date such as stress may be associated with risk for CRC as a result of how stress perturbs the microbiota. If we determine that stress contributes to CRC risk via microbial perturbations, future bio-behavioral interventions that incorporate stress management and dietary/supplemental recommendations to promote mucosal health, and therefore reduce CRC risk, can be developed and implemented which could lead to diminished health care costs related to diagnosis and treatment and reduce CRC disparities between black and white women. In addition to providing valuable data, the proposed research project will also provide the opportunity for the additional training needed for Dr. Carson's development as an independently funded bio-behavioral cancer disparities researcher. Dr. Carson will engage in an intensive, structured training experience to develop expertise by completing the following: 1) Training in the recruitment of racially diverse clinical and community populations for bio-specimen and bio-banking research, 2) Obtaining hands-on and didactic training in bioinformatics techniques, and 3) Improving professional skills such as team science, networking, grant writing, mentoring, and high-impact publications. Under the guidance of an esteemed panel of mentors and collaborators and the high quality research and training environment that the University of Alabama at Birmingham offers, Dr. Carson's research and training experiences will make a significant contribution to the scientific community and Dr. Carson's overall career development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the USA, and the disparity between black and white women remains unexplained. This study will evaluate novel biological, behavioral and environmental factors that may contribute to this disparity. Findings from this study will provide insight into whether stress and the microbiot contribute to risk for CRC and possibly lead to innovative interventions to reduce CRC incidence and disparities.","The Interplay of Behavior, Environment, and Microbiota in Colorectal Cancer Risk",9755367,K01CA190559,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alabama ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol

To address the multiple barriers to CRC screening (patient, clinician, and system), our team developed mPATH-CRC (mobile PAtient Technology for Health-Colorectal Cancer), a patient-friendly iPad program used by individuals immediately before a routine primary care visit. mPATH-CRC is a CRC screening decision aid that helps patients make a screening decision, allows patients to “self-order” a CRC screening test, and minimizes provider and system barriers. After the visit, mPATH-CRC automatically sends patients who choose to be screened supportive text messages at key times to help them complete their chosen test. In our recently completed randomized controlled trial of 450 diverse patients (R01CA178941), mPATH- CRC doubled the proportion of patients who completed CRC screening. To fully realize mPATH-CRC's potential to decrease CRC mortality, the program now must be implemented in primary care practices in a way that encourages routine and sustained use. However, while hundreds of mobile health (mHealth) tools have been developed in recent years, the optimal strategies for implementing and maintaining mHealth interventions in clinical practice are unknown. We have developed a “high touch” mHealth implementation strategy based on our prior research and guided by the Technology Acceptance Model and the Dynamic Sustainability Framework. Our strategy leverages evidence-based elements including clinic champions, facilitation, regular data feedback, follow-up training, and adaptation. Our team now proposes to compare the results of the “high touch” strategy to a “low touch” strategy using a Type III hybrid study design and incorporating mixed methods to evaluate implementation, maintenance, and effectiveness of mPATH-CRC in a diverse sample of community-based practices. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to: 1) in a cluster-randomized controlled trial of 28 primary care clinics, compare the implementation outcomes of a “high touch” evidence-based mHealth implementation strategy with a “low touch” implementation strategy; 2) in a nested pre-post study, estimate the effect of mPATH-CRC on completion of CRC screening within 16 weeks of visit; and 3) determine the factors that facilitate or impede the maintenance of mHealth interventions like mPATH-CRC by surveying and interviewing clinic staff and providers as part of a mixed-methods analysis. This project could decrease CRC morbidity and mortality by translating our evidence-based CRC-screening intervention into community practice, directly addressing the goals of Healthy People 2020 and the National Cancer Moonshot. Importantly, completion of these aims will yield essential information for successful implementation of other technology- mediated interventions in primary care settings, addressing a current gap in knowledge. mPATH-CRC is an innovative iPad app that patients use before a primary care medical visit to help them receive colorectal cancer screening, a widely recommended test that decreases mortality. However, while hundreds of health apps have been developed in recent years, the best strategies for incorporating apps in routine primary care remain unknown. This project will determine the optimal way to implement mPATH-CRC and other technology-based programs in community-based primary care practices, increasing the use of life- saving screening tests and improving the delivery of medical care.",Effectiveness and Implementation of mPATH-CRC:  a Mobile Health System for Colorectal Cancer Screening,9657712,R01CA218416,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Savings ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' suburb ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Health Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Community Practice ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' dissemination trial ', ' implementation trial ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community based practice ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' primary care setting ', ' secondary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' secondary analysis ', ' Text Messaging ', ' texting ', ' short message service ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NCI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,505500,0.2758657905103999
"Enhancing Prevention Pathways Towards Tribal Colorectal Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) experience significant health inequities and disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) related incidence, mortality, stage at diagnosis, and survival. Recent reductions in CRC incidence and mortality rates and improvements in stage at diagnosis and survival rates in the general U.S. population have been attributed to routine screening with prompt removal of polyps, early detection, and timely and appropriate treatment. AI/ANs are significantly less likely than non-Hispanic Whites to receive timely and risk- and age-appropriate cancer screenings, including recommended CRC screening. The short-term goal is to test the efficacy of serially implemented interventions designed to enhance annual CRC screening using the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Serial implementation refers to offering routine screening, irrespective of response to an earlier invitation, in concordance with national guidelines which recommend annual FIT testing between ages 50-75. The FIT is most appropriate because, based on consensus guidelines, it is an approved, high sensitivity fecal occult blood test that is offered annually and is available in Indian Health Service and tribal health facilities where resources to provide screening colonoscopy are limited. We will follow all positive FIT results with timely and appropriate diagnostic and treatment services. We address screening disparities through the testing of interventions designed to enhance annual CRC screening using the FIT among average- risk, on-reservation AIs aged 50-75 in the rural Southwest. The interventions are theory-informed, evidence- based, and graded in their intensity. The high intensity intervention will include navigated outreach, a mailed FIT kit, educational material, and follow-up reminders (Study Group 1). The medium intensity intervention will include a mailed FIT kit, educational material, and follow-up reminders (Study Group 2). The reference group (Study Group 3) will receive usual care (screening recommendation and a FIT kit at a clinic visit). We will use rigorous research methods to: (a) determine the efficacy of interventions to enhance annual CRC screening through completion of the FIT kit; (b) understand contextually relevant factors important for behavior change; (c) identify the most cost-effective strategies to enhance routine CRC screening; and (d) develop plans to inform sustainability and scalability. This is a collaborative effort between the University of New Mexico, the Albuquerque Area Indian Health Board (100% Indian-owned and operated), and six Pueblo Tribes in the rural Southwest. The research team has an extensive and successful history of conducting community based participatory cancer prevention research in collaboration with AI communities. Moreover, the research team recognizes the value of integrating a co-learning process and engaging in trust-based mutually beneficial research. Findings from this research could lead to an immediate increase in CRC screening and ultimately reduce the CRC disease burden among AIs experiencing cancer disparities and health inequities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age- and risk-appropriate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening coupled with prompt removal of polyps, early detection, and timely and appropriate treatment can reduce CRC incidence and mortality, detect and diagnose CRC at an earlier stage, and improve survival. However, American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have not benefitted equally from these gains in CRC control. To the best of our knowledge, no research has tested, with scientific and methodological rigor, strategies to enhance CRC screening among AIs. Documenting the efficacy of serially implemented CRC interventions designed to enhance the annual uptake of CRC screening tests among AIs can lead to broad implementation of evidence-based CRC screening interventions that could ultimately address the national and tribal priority of reducing CRC disparities among AIs.",Enhancing Prevention Pathways Towards Tribal Colorectal Health,9455624,R01CA192967,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' diagnosis service ', ' Diagnostic Services ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Priorities ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Directors ', ' Physician Executives ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' New Mexico ', ' Polyps ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Indian Health Service ', ' United States Indian Health Service ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' Rural ', ' Program Sustainability ', ' Program Sustainabilities ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Consensus ', ' Test Result ', ' behavior change ', ' Colorectal ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' meetings ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Indian reservation ', ' tribal reservation ', ' reservation community ', ' native american reservation ', ' nation reservation ', ' American Indian reservation ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Address ', ' tribal health ', ' tribe health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Reservations ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Pueblo Race ', ' Pueblo ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Coupled ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' efficacy testing ', ' health equity ', ' arm ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' trial design ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' rural Americans ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' screening disparities ', ' screening guidelines ', ' screening recommendations ', ' recommended screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,R01,2019,1,0.2943049524030131
"Internet-based Motivational Interviewing for Colonoscopy in African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to other racial groups, African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) morbidity and mortality rates. Although colonoscopies can prevent CRC, nearly half of African Americans (40.2%) have not received a screening colonoscopy within the recommended time frame (one colonoscopy per ten years). It is critical to increase African Americans' screening colonoscopy rates in order to reduce racial inequities in CRC morbidity and mortality. Dr. Miller's pilot work, as well as the current literature, suggest that an Internet-based Motivational Interviewing Intervention for Colonoscopy (I-MIIC) may help improve African Americans' screening colonoscopy uptake. The proposed project will first field-test the intervention, using an iterative approach, with African Americans referred for a screening colonoscopy (N=40). The field-testing results will guide the development, revisions, and finalization of the I-MIIC. Then, a randomized clinical trial will examine the efficacy of the -MIIC for improving African Americans' screening colonoscopy uptake. Participants (N=200) will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (N=100) in which they engage in a 20-minute I-MIIC intervention or a control group (N=100) in which they review a print brochure on CRC screening. The results will contribute to the growing literature on CRC disparities. Dr. Sarah Miller is the ideal candidate to spearhead this line of research given her academic and clinical background in CRC disparities and motivational interviewing. Dr. Miller's long-term goal is to become an independent researcher with expertise in the early detection and prevention of cancer in racial/ethnic minorities. To achieve her goals, as part of the K07, Dr. Miller will receie intensive training in four areas: 1) qualitative research; 2) e-Health; 3) longitudinal data analyss, and 4) professional development. The K07 will provide Dr. Miller with a variety of avenues to achieve her training goals and enhance her expertise. In particular, Dr. Miller will have ongoing meetings with seasoned mentors as well as participate in formal coursework, workshops, conferences, and interactive trainings. The proposed K07 will form the foundation for a program of research that focuses on improving cancer screening uptake in racial/ethnic minorities with the goal of reducing disparities. At the end of the K07 funding period, Dr. Miller will submit an R01 application, based on the results of the present study. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) is the ideal environment for Dr. Miller to complete her proposed research project and training. In particular, the ISMMS can offer Dr. Miller: 1) the resources necessary to complete her research; 2) access to multiple training activities; and 3) access to a diverse patient population. Most importantly, Dr. Miller will receive guidance from a team of superior mentors with expertise in: CRC disparities, qualitative research, biostatistics, e-Health, and primary care. The mentoring team will work closely with Dr. Miller to ensure that she achieves her research and training objectives. Overall, the K07 will provide Dr. Miller with the research experience, intensive training, and mentorship needed to become a successful independent researcher. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research has significant public health relevance. The development of an Internet-based motivational interviewing intervention for colonoscopy (I-MIIC) to increase African Americans' screening colonoscopy uptake will help to reduce disparities in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates. If the I- MIIC proves efficacious, there is a strong argument to replicate this intervention with other vulnerable populations and with other cancer tests.",Internet-based Motivational Interviewing for Colonoscopy in African Americans,9759790,K07CA190726,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Appointment ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Control Groups ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Patients ', ' Polyps ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Seasons ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' prevent colorectal cancer ', ' prevent colo-rectal cancer ', ' colo-rectal cancer prevention ', ' CRC prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' programs ', ' Test Result ', ' meetings ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Participant ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Reporting ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Preventive ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Premalignant ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Preparation ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Cancerous ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' patient population ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' attentional control ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' recruit ', ' intervention cost ', ' screening guidelines ', ' screening recommendations ', ' recommended screening ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K07,2019,170640,0.23616207167541448
"Colorectal cancer disparities:Racial differences in colorectal adenopolyps and altered expression of Mitochondrial genes Abstract: Regardless of race, 50 years of age is the current screening recommendations for colorectal cancer (CRC) disease based on an assumption that the prevailing CRC disparities are relatively due to differences in access to quality screening and the post diagnostic therapies. However, several lines of evidence have suggested that in younger age groups, AA have twice the CRC incidence rate as Whites, and their stage- adjusted CRC survival rates are lower than Whites. Given that most CRCs arise from precancerous of adenomatous polyps (adenopolyps) that evolve into invasive adenocarcinoma, it is plausible that certain “modifying” genes expression may potentially responsible for the observation in AA experience to earlier adenopolyps initiation and more rapid adenopolyps progression to adenocarcinoma. If such is the case, one potential factor in the persistent of CRC disparities may be the race-nonconforming/or neutral age guideline for screening initiation. Studies regarding age-related AA-White differences in CRC progression through the intermediate stages (polyp sizes of tubular, tubulovillous, and villous, and dysplastic histology) are needed. To establish such evidence, it requires genetic alteration study in a modifying gene(s) and a tissue source representing the colorectal adenopolyp prevalence and profile in the population from a large enough autopsy sample size with complete adenopolyps clearance and having complete colorectal adenopolyps documentation. Our study will leverage a unique of 640 colorectal adenopolyp/ cancer cases and 1280 control tissue samples in a frequency matched nested case-control within our lab and Southern Division Co-operative Human tissues Network at University of Alabama collected through previous NIH-funded studies. The sample size has sufficient statistical power to compare AA and Whites on precancerous of colorectal adenopolyps prevalence and cancer-relevant features with difference age strata. These tissue collections are large and well-annotated by micro-dissection. Our laboratory recently demonstrated that there were progressive increase of mitochondrial gene expressions in colorectal adenopolyps and carcinomas when compared to their normal surrounding tissues (accepted paper Tumor Biology #TUBI-16-00926R1), suggesting that certain mt-genes expression are involved in the malignancy of colorectal adenopolyps to invasive adenocarcinoma. Based on these data, the central hypothesis of this project is that over-expression of certain mt-genes play a role in the aggressiveness of precancerous colorectal tumor behavior within younger AA which are reflected in their high incidence and low survival rate of this disease. To test this hypothesis, we will determine the level of mt-genes alterations in colorectal adenopolyps between AA-White subgroups. Also, we will evaluate our results relative to AA-White differences within 10 year age strata and their related features (size, histology, anatomic location, dysplasia status, and adenocarcinoma), as well as body mass index (BMI) using univariate statistical tests, multiple regression and cluster analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans (AA) have twice the CRC incidence rate as Whites, and survival rates are lower than Whites. Studies linking rapid colorectal polyps progression to cancer among AA Individual younger than 50 years old are lacking. This study will explore mitochondrial genes expression in colorectal adenopolyp tissue samples obtained from AA and white of difference age strata and results could potentially facilitate changes in the recommended screening age.",Colorectal cancer disparities:Racial differences in colorectal adenopolyps and altered expression of Mitochondrial genes,9729742,SC3GM122669,"['Adenocarcinoma ', '

"Culturally Adapted Multilevel Decision Support Navigation Trial to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Disparity among At-Risk Asian American Primary Care Patients PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans, and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) is ranked as the second most common in cancer deaths among Asian Americans. However, recent data show that CRC screening rates are substantially lower for Chinese and Korean Americans (CKAs) compared with other racial/ethnic groups. To date, a small number of community-based studies have reported on the use of single level (participant level only) interventions to increase CRC screening rates among CKAs; however, very little is known about the impact of multi-level (patient-oriented and provider-oriented) interventions on CRC screening adherence among CKA patients in primary care setting. Furthermore, our preliminary data indicate physician's recommendation as the strongest facilitator of CRC screening among CKAs. Thus, the primary objective of the study is to address this important knowledge gap by conducting a randomized controlled trial to determine the impact of a multi-level culturally-sensitive decision support intervention on CRC screening adherence among 400 CKA primary care patients. Previous studies found that facilitating patient decision-making through decision support and providing patient navigation can increase CRC screening among diverse primary care patients. We will culturally adapt existing evidence- based decision support navigation intervention (CA-DSNI) and test its efficacy among 200 CKA men and 200 CKA women aged 50 to 75 eligible for CRC screening. We will recruit the participants from primary care physicians (PCPs) clinics. The study is designed to compare CRC screening outcomes between the CA-DSNI and the Advanced Control (AC). Those randomized to the AC will receive an informational booklet, a stool blood test kit and a reminder by mail. Those randomized to the CA-DSNI will receive everything the AC receives. Additionally, we will provide decision support and navigation contacts to participants, develop an individualized screening plan using a theory-based online Decision Counseling Program, share the plan with the participants' PCPs, and have PCPs to encourage the screening to participants. Using outcomes data collected by survey and medical record review, we will: (1) determine overall CRC screening adherence in the CA-DSNI vs. the AC; (2) measure change in CRC screening decision stage in the CA-DSNI vs. the AC; and (3) Assess CRC screening test-specific (stool blood test vs. colonoscopy) adherence in the CA-DSNI vs. the AC. Additionally, we will evaluate intervention reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance using interview data. IMPACT: This study represents the first instance in which CA-DSNI will be used with CKAs in primary care practice settings to address a significant cancer disparity. With growing need for linguistically and culturally competent care, more decision support, language facilitation, and navigation efforts may come into care settings. Therefore, having tested interventions ready for the target population will be timely, and medical systems may benefit from having multilevel best practices known and tested for CKAs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans, but colorectal cancer screening rate remains low in this population. The goal of this R01 award application is to increase colorectal cancer screening among underserved Chinese and Korean Americans through cultural adaptation and implementation of a decision support navigation trial provided in primary care setting.

"Adaptive Intervention to Maximize Colorectal Screening in Safety Net Populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening related reductions in incidence and mortality are not benefiting all population subgroups. In clinical settings, repeat attempts at promoting screening are often required over time with the same patients. Few studies have evaluated whether repeated use of interventions in underserved groups can produce greater screening. Multi 'dose' interventions may be necessary to elevate screening rates to levels seen with breast and cervical cancer screening. This study will utilize a Bayesian adaptive design to study CRC screening in a highly diverse, safety-net clinic population. Although a growing number of studies have found implementation intentions-based interventions effective, no studies have tested such techniques twice in sequence to enhance CRC screening uptake. CRC screening implementation intentions address the ""when,"" ""where"" and ""how"" details of stool sample or colonoscopy screening. A randomized design will test a comparison condition of generic health education (HE) versus implementation intentions (I2), and, for participants who do not complete screening within six months, will re-randomize to one of these two strategies again. All intervention materials will be delivered via low-cost touch screen computers and tablets customized for use in English, Spanish, Nepali, Burmese, and Arabic for Somalis (to accommodate safety-net refugee clients). Pilot testing and formative phase focus groups will test the salience and appropriateness of touch screen audio, video, and graphic materials for each of these groups (except Nepali, where materials were recently developed and pilot tested). The study will be conducted with 500 patients eligible for CRC screening in a group of 9 safety- net primary care clinics. All participants will complete a touch screen administered screening form, informed consent, a baseline survey, and receive information on test options. Because of the rapidly changing insurance landscape for the underserved, we will not cover test costs beyond coverage already in place or obtained for each participant. Participants who complete screening within 6 months will only receive HE or I2 once. Those who do not screen will receive a second intervention dose and re-assessment of insurance status to test varied combination effects of HE +HE, HE + I2, I2 + I2, or I2 + HE on CRC screening completion. Changes or variations in health coverage will be analyzed as a co-variate. Six and 12-month phone surveys will be completed with all participants. The primary outcome will be CRC screening completion at 12 months. Secondary outcomes will come from a mediation analysis of the main outcome and co-variates. We will conduct a cost analysis of the intervention and its variable components. This study will provide important information on the utility and feasibility of embedding low-cost, implementation intentions-based interventions in ""real-world"" primary care, where they may be cost effective for repeated application over time with difficult to promote behaviors such as CRC screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although Colorectal Cancer (CRC) screening is now used by more of the age eligible population than in prior decades, many low-income and uninsured individuals remain unscreened. This project will test an adaptive and sequential intervention approach to maximize rates of screening among a safety-net clinic population suffering from high rates of CRC disparities. It will target a diverse sample of patients including low-income African Americans, Latinos, refugees, and Whites. We will use a Bayesian adaptive design to test the impact of one or two doses of an ""implementation intentions"" informed behavioral intervention versus generic health education on CRC screening. Study outcomes will be measured from fecal immunochemical test or colonoscopy reports from the study testing center.",Adaptive Intervention to Maximize Colorectal Screening in Safety Net Populations,9665693,R01CA188898,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Client ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Computers ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Incidence ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Insurance ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Privatization ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Tablets ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Uninsured ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Baseline Surveys ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Colorectal ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' touchscreen ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' safety net ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Burmese ', ' program costs ', ' intervention cost ', ' breast and cervical cancer screening ', ' stool sample ', ' stool specimen ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,582773,0.2827865174684771
"CARES-REACH (Colorectal Cancer Awareness, Research, Education and Screening-Rural Expansion, Access and Capacity for Health) ABSTRACT Despite the Healthy People 2020 goal of 70.5%, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are about 40%. The proposed study seeks to address this disparity and accelerate the adoption of effective cancer prevention and control screening practices to promote CRC screening. Leveraging our established community-academic network, which emphasizes participatory approaches among community, clinical, and academic stakeholders, we build on our extensive preparatory research that tested a low-literacy educational intervention plus Fecal Immunochemical Test [FIT]), and which resulted in initial screening rates of 80%. This work was primarily carried-out in urban-based settings. Prior research shows that repeat FIT screening rates often drop significantly without intervention and that there are notable geographic- related CRC disparities with higher mortality seen among individuals in rural areas. Additional research is needed to address repeat screening and expand our reach to other at-risk and rural populations. Informed by a community-based participatory research (CBPR) framework and enriched by implementation science approaches, CARES-REACH features a stepped wedge design with extension for maintenance to support an implementation strategy focused on multiple levels: organizational, provider, and patient level that entail processes to boost initial and repeat screening among average risk and age-eligible adults. This multilevel study entails implementation of a core set of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) that include: low literacy patient education (English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole language); provider education, system-wide electronic medical record (EMR) tools and prompts, and FIT distribution plus an organization-wide cancer control champion who motivates providers, navigates patients, and monitors system-wide screening activities. Specific aims are to: 1) implement an organization-wide multilevel CRC intervention using EBIs plus a cancer control champion in FQHCs located in rural and urban Central and Southwest Florida; 2) explore whether practice setting and population characteristics may differentially impact annual clinic CRC uniform Data system (UDS) screening rates; and 3) conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the implementation process (facilitators and impediments), resource requirements, and intermediate patient outcomes for the program in FQHC organizations. The intervention will be rolled out in a stepwise-method across clinics: one group of clinics receives early intervention roll-out and the other clinics are delayed to allow for rigorous comparison. The main outcome is change in annual clinic CRC screening rates compared to CRC screening rates of the prior year for each clinic as well as comparing screening rates among early roll-out clinics vs. delayed roll-out clinics. Addressing implementation processes will guide and direct scale-up to other FQHCs and community health systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cause of cancer death in the U.S. Yet, screening rates are less than optimal in many Federally Qualified Health Centers, even with new tests that can be done easily at home, such as the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). This study seeks to speed up the adoption of effective cancer prevention and control screening practices by promoting CRC screening in community clinics (rural and urban) in Central and Southwest Florida with added attention on repeat screening. A number of strategies will be implemented including low-literacy patient education combined with FIT distribution plus a cancer control champion. Our goal is to change the annual CRC screening rates at the clinics.","CARES-REACH (Colorectal Cancer Awareness, Research, Education and Screening-Rural Expansion, Access and Capacity for Health)",9958267,R01CA249689,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Florida ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Language ', ' literacy ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Rural Population ', ' Savings ', ' Testing ', ' Urban Population ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Process Measure ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' Patient Monitoring System ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' Funding ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' tool ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically underserved population ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Community Health ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' Mind ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' implementation science ', ' primary care setting ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' Haitian ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' patient screening ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' practice setting ', ' annual screening ', ' routine screening ', ' implementation strategy ', ' community clinic ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Patient-Centered Reminders to Inform, Motivate, and Engage Colorectal Cancer Screening Adherence in Rural Communities: The PRIME-CRC Trial Project Summary/Abstract: We will expand an existing, patient-centered, health literacy strategy to promote longer-term adherence to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in resource-limited, rural health clinics via colonoscopy or annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Guided by recently completed trials, we will leverage consumer technologies that are now available in rural areas and implement a multifaceted approach - designed for scale in resource-limited federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). While significant gains have been made to improve CRC screening, compliance with those guidelines is sub-optimal and disparities remain. In particular, adults who receive care at rural FQHCs that have limited resources struggle to initiate and maintain annual CRC screening via the most common method, FIT. Over the past decade, our team has studied the effectiveness of specific interventions to enhance initial and repeat CRC screening completion among lower income, lower health literate, racial/ethnically diverse adults in rural FQHC settings. The majority of patients will complete the initial test (67% - 69%), yet fewer (32% - 40%) complete an annual test in years 2 and 3. This indicates a ‘stepped care’ approach is needed to promote long-term CRC screening. Our rural health literacy interventions have until now been limited to the FIT due to restrictions of state Medicaid coverage and clinical bandwidth of colonoscopy services available to rural FQHCs. Changes to Medicaid have now expanded the availability of colonoscopy. We now propose a novel intervention guided by evidence learned from our previous studies and recent literature - the Patient-centered Reminders to Inform, Motivate, and Engage-CRC Screening (PRIME-CRC).In our proposed 2-arm, randomized control trial (N=1200), both PRIME-CRC and enhanced usual care arms will receive our health literacy evidence-based practices for delivering CRC patient information and counseling to aid patient decision making for selecting FIT or colonoscopy and simplified test instructions. PRIME-CRC will additionally have a stepped care’ approach for reminding patients on proper CRC screening preparation for scheduled colonoscopy or completion of annual FIT. Patients in the PRIME-CRC arm will have frequent follow-up with tailored contact via automated call or SMS text (based on patient preference) from their healthcare provider (audio recorded or personalized text) .The primary outcome will be completion of either colonoscopy or annual FIT over 3 years. Our specific aims are to: Test the effectiveness of the PRIME-CRC intervention to improve CRC screening completion rates in rural FQHCs compared to enhanced usual care. Investigate whether the intervention can reduce CRC screening disparities by patient health literacy, race or sex. Determine the fidelity, or reliability of PRIME-CRC components, and explore patient, provider, and healthcare system barriers to implementation. Evaluate the cost associated with the intervention from a FQHC perspective. This study extends our team’s longstanding collaboration on health literacy, health disparities, rural health and cancer screening. Project Narrative Despite significant gains in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening promotion, disparities persist among low-income individuals, those with fewer years of education, racial/ethnic minorities, and rural populations. Residents of rural areas suffer significant health inequities and encounter barriers to CRC screening which are often overlooked in healthcare research. This project seeks to address these disparities with a health literacy, shared decision making strategy coupled with tailored ‘stepped care’ automated telephone outreach (recorded by the patient’s primary care provider) that promotes long-term adherence to CRC screening in resource-limited, rural health centers via colonoscopy or annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT).","Patient-Centered Reminders to Inform, Motivate, and Engage Colorectal Cancer Screening Adherence in Rural Communities: The PRIME-CRC Trial",9970883,R01CA240496,"['adenoma ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Louisiana ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Health Centers ', ' rural health clinic ', ' Rural Population ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Rural Community ', ' Schedule ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Services ', ' novel ', ' literate ', ' outreach ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Preparation ', ' sex ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' point of care ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Coupled ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' shared decision making ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer patients ', ' colorectal cancer patients ', ' colon cancer patients ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' gender disparity ', ' healthcare research ', ' Health Care Research ', ' rural resident ', ' rural dwellers ', ' rural patients ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' screening disparities ', ' usual care control group ', ' usual care arm ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' screening guidelines ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NCI,LOUISIANA STATE UNIV HSC SHREVEPORT,R01,2020,411136,0.18821801293071444
"Prediciting and addressing colonoscopy non-adherence in community settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. While research has shown that colorectal cancer screening decreases colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, only 65% of eligible adults were screened at the recommended interval in 2015. Even more troubling, those who are screened do not always get timely follow-up care for abnormal results. Dr. Lynn Butterly demonstrated that patient navigation can effectively raise rates of colonoscopy uptake among low-income, uninsured patients in New Hampshire, boosting rates 27 percentage points over usual care (96.2% vs 69.3%, P<.001). Using data from the STOP CRC study of 26 community clinics, our team developed a risk prediction model that can stratify patients according to their probability of adherence with follow-up colonoscopy. Our study will answer a key pragmatic question: can patient navigation effectively improve follow-up colonoscopy among patients who have a moderate or low probability of adhering to follow-up colonoscopy; and secondarily, does the effectiveness of patient navigation differ by patients’ probability level? We will build on our successful ongoing research to test a patient-level intervention, driven by the Chronic Care Model, to increase diagnostic follow-up for colorectal cancer screening. In Aim 1, we will validate the risk prediction model, stratify patients according to risk, and adapt patient navigation materials to local resources and settings. In Aim 2, we will conduct a two-arm randomized-controlled trial involving 28 clinics (~1200 patients with positive fecal tests) and will compare patient navigation and usual care in raising rates of follow-up colonoscopy. We will assess the effectiveness (completion of colonoscopy within 1 year) of the program overall, as well as the effectiveness by category of probability of adherence to follow-up colonoscopy (moderate vs. low). This large-scale, clinic-randomized, two-arm follow-up colonoscopy program among safety net patients will leverage the expertise of our research team, which has implemented numerous systems-based interventions in multiple health care settings and used electronic health record tools to deliver clinic-based interventions. We will build on these successes in undertaking the largest study to-date addressing follow-up colonoscopy uptake among patients who receive care in safety net clinics. This study could optimize the delivery of patient navigation, support the broad adoption of patient navigation programs, and greatly improve colonoscopy follow-up rates in this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Thousands of adults each year undergo screening for colorectal cancer through a fecal test, but those whose test results are positive do not always get timely follow-up colonoscopies. Our team has developed a model that can tell which patients are likely to get a follow-up colonoscopy, and we will use the model to test whether patient navigation can increase follow-up colonoscopy among patients who have a moderate or low probability of getting follow-up.

"Epigenetic dysregulation in APC-negative colorectal cancer The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is higher in African Americans (AAs) compared with US whites (NHWs) overall, but the disparity is more extreme in persons with earlier age of onset. The median age of onset is 65 in AAs compared to 72 in NHWs, and early-onset CRC is more than twice as frequent in AAs than in NHWs. In addition, epidemiologic evidence suggests that younger age CRCs may have a more rapid progression through the steps of carcinogenesis. Yet, younger age CRC is not well characterized in any population, and we have no explanation for its higher incidence in AAs. In a recent genomic analysis of a series of Chicago African American CRC cases, we found an excess of CRCs lacking mutation in the tumor suppressor gene APC (APC mutation-negative CRCs). Microsatellite stable APC mutation-negative CRCs were associated with younger age of diagnosis, fewer numbers of somatic mutations, and microsatellite and chromosome stability. Importantly, we discovered that APC mutation-negative CRCs exhibited a novel methylation profile characterized by increased levels of methylation in key cancer driver genes including those in stem-cell maintenance and the WNT signaling pathway. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that epigenetic dysregulation in APC mutation-negative CRCs drives specific DNA methylation changes and gene regulatory networks that maintain a stem-like cancer phenotype. The overall goal of the project is to characterize the molecular mechanisms that drive this novel subtype of CRCs. We have three aims. Aim 1. Identify and characterize significant differentially methylated regions in AA CRC. Hypothesis: Tumor- specific differentially methylated regions are associated with carcinogenesis in APC mutation-negative CRCs. APC mutation-negative CRCs will be associated with earlier age of onset and with distinct molecular and clinicopathological features. Aim 2. Identify and characterize differentially expressed genes and regulatory networks in AA CRCs. Hypothesis: Specific regulatory networks that maintain a stem-like cancer phenotype are associated with APC mutation-negative CRCs. Aim 3. Determine driver gene dependencies of AA CRCs in organoid cancer models. Hypothesis: Suppression of specific WNT signaling factors and epigenetic modulators will induce increased epithelial differentiation in APC mutation-negative organoids in comparison to APC mutation-positive organoids. The proposed studies will provide essential knowledge of the DNA methylation and gene expression changes underlying AA CRCs and will characterize cancer cell responses to chemical challenge. The new knowledge will provide translatable information, including diagnostic and predictive biomarkers and precision-medicine approaches, that could be used to treat a novel subtype of CRC that occurs in excess in AAs and is associated with earlier age of onset. African Americans have a higher incidence rate of colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer diagnosed before age 50 constitutes over 15% of all colorectal cancers diagnoses—a major cancer health disparity. We have discovered a subtype of colorectal cancers that lack mutation in the APC gene that is associated with earlier ages of diagnosis and a novel epigenetic signature that impacts cancer stem cell maintenance. We will characterize the DNA methylation and transcriptomic signatures and interrogate with genetic and chemical perturbations the pathway-specific vulnerabilities of this subtype, leading to the identification of gene targets and enabling development of precision-medicine approaches to earlier age of onset colorectal cancers in African Americans.",Epigenetic dysregulation in APC-negative colorectal cancer,9960046,R01CA242914,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chicago ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Epithelium ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Deletion ', ' gene deletion mutation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Methylation ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Persons ', ' Organoids ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Adenomatosis Polyposis Coli Gene ', ' Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Genes ', ' DP2.5 ', ' APC gene ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Chemicals ', ' Epithelial ', ' drug sensitivity ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Microsatellite Markers ', ' Microsatellites ', ' Microsatellite Repeats ', ' Genetic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' chemical library ', ' small molecule libraries ', ' chromosome mutation ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Chromosome Stabilities ', ' Chromosomal Stability ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' CancerModel ', ' Cancer Model ', ' Cell Growth and Maintenance ', ' Cell Maintenance ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' WNT signaling ', ' WNT Signaling Pathway ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' early onset ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer progenitor cells ', ' malignant stem cell ', ' cancer stem cell ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' transcriptomics ', ' stem ', ' tumor ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive marker ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' genomic profiles ', ' expression subtypes ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' molecular subsets ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' mutation status ', ' mutational status ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2020,541456,0.0920198322910581
"Randomized controlled trial of the stool DNA test to improve colorectal cancer screening among Alaska Native people PROJECT SUMMARY Only 59% (29-73%) of Alaska Native people have been adequately screened for colorectal cancer (CRC), which could save lives, despite having the highest reported incidence of CRC in the world. A new at-home multi-target stool DNA screening test (MT-sDNA; Cologuard®) with high sensitivity for pre-cancerous polyps and CRC is now available. MT-sDNA has not been tested for feasibility or acceptability within the Alaska tribal health care delivery system, and it is unknown whether use of this new test will increase Alaska Native CRC screening rates. Our long-term goal is to improve screening and reduce CRC-attributable mortality. The objective of this application is to test the effectiveness of MT-sDNA for increasing CRC screening in Alaska Native communities using a mixed methods, community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach. The study will be conducted in collaboration with regional Tribal health organizations who are responsible for providing health care to geographically remote Alaska Native communities. This research has been requested by Tribal organizations. Although the proposed implementation strategy is evidence-informed and promising, it is novel in that MT-sDNA has not been evaluated in the tribal health setting or among rural/remote populations. Using the Social Ecological Model, our research will be multi-level, examining influence on patients, providers, and tribal health organizations (THOs). This research study will pursue two specific aims: (1) Identify patient-, provider-, and system-level factors associated with CRC screening preferences, uptake, and follow-up; and (2) test the effectiveness of graded intensity MT-sDNA intervention in the Alaska Native community setting. For the first aim, focus groups with Alaska Native people who are non- or inadequately adherent to CRC screening guidelines, and surveys and interviews with healthcare providers will be used to identify individual, interpersonal (provider), and health system factors for future intervention. For the second aim, a three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (high intensity with patient navigation, medium intensity with mailed reminders, usual care) will provide evidence on the usefulness of MT-sDNA in remote tribal communities as well as the first data on MT-sDNA diagnostic follow up adherence rates in the Alaska Native population. This aim will also provide evidence on the usability of MT-sDNA in the Alaska setting by evaluating MT-sDNA sample quality and neoplastic yield, which will inform plans to scale-up the intervention model. This project is innovative because an effective strategy for achieving higher screening rates than current practice could lead to increased prevention or early detection of CRC cases among Alaska Native people. The proposed research is significant because it will address a health disparity of community concern. This research has the potential to sustainably improve public health by increasing CRC screening rates among a rural/remote tribal population as well as provide a model for other integrated health systems that provide care to high-risk or underserved populations in the U.S. and worldwide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alaska Native people have the highest reported colorectal cancer burden in the world, yet only half have been screened for this disease, which could save lives. This multi-level, mixed-methods randomized controlled trial will investigate the effectiveness of a new at-home multi-target stool DNA test (MT-sDNA; Cologuard) to improve colorectal cancer screening rates among Alaska Native people living in rural/remote communities. If use of MT-sDNA increases colorectal cancer screening, it will help reduce Alaska Native deaths due to this disease, have broad-reaching clinical and policy impacts, and provide insight into a novel method that could improve screening among other integrated health systems that provide care to high-risk and underserved populations in the United States and worldwide.",Randomized controlled trial of

"Screening More patients for CRC through Adapting and Refining Targeted Evidence-based Interventions in Rural settings (SMARTER CRC) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: This two-phase project is designed to achieve the Cancer Moonshot objectives by reducing the burden of CRC on the US population. Specifically, we aim to improve CRC screening rates, follow-up colonoscopy, and referral to care in rural Medicaid patients by implementing a direct mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach and patient navigation for follow-up colonoscopy. We leverage partnerships with the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Kaiser Northwest Center for Health Research, and Medicaid Health Plans and deliver training and implementation support to participating rural primary care clinics using practice facilitation. In total, we anticipate working with 30 organizations to facilitate implementation with 130 primary care clinics (reaching 17,000+ rural Medicaid patients). In Phase I (Year 01), we will conduct a milestone driven pilot to build the necessary infrastructure for a large-scale implementation-effectiveness trial, including adapting the clinic-health plan-vendor supported direct mail program for rural Medicaid patients that have not established care and/or never been screened; conducting a pilot study testing the feasibility and acceptability of patient navigation to support follow-up colonoscopy following an abnormal fecal test; engaging Medicaid Health Plans and recruiting 30 primary care clinics located in rural and frontier counties in Oregon; and developing the training and support materials needed to implement a large-scale trial in these settings. In Phase II (Years 02-05), we will conduct an implementation-effectiveness study using a quasi- experimental stepped wedge design in 30 rural primary care clinics using program training and practice facilitation to support implementation. As in the pilot, the intervention combines: (1) a clinic-health plan- vendor supported direct-mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach for patients who have never been screened or who have yet to establish care and (2) patient navigation for those who are referred for colonoscopy as either the primary screening or for follow-up from an abnormal fecal test. We will evaluate effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention through quantitative and qualitative measures. Results from the implementation study will inform scale-up of the program through partnerships with 20 regional and national organizations that serve rural/frontier primary care clinics using webinars, train-the-trainer workshops and collaborative learning activities using the ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) model. PROJECT NARRATIVE Disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, follow-up, and referral to care exist in rural communities and for sub-populations within (e.g., Medicaid enrollees, Hispanic patients). In SMARTER CRC, our multidisciplinary team will adapt, pilot, then test the implementation and scale-up of targeted direct-mail and patient navigation programs – two effective multicomponent interventions – in partnership with rural clinics, health plans (payers), and commercial vendors. Our approach leverages an established rural practice-based research network; addresses patient, clinic, and community level factors; and will ultimately reduce CRC disparities in rural Medicaid patients and support Biden's Cancer Moonshot objectives.",Screening More patients for CRC through Adapting and Refining Targeted Evidence-based Interventions in Rural settings (SMARTER CRC),10250715,UH3CA244298,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Endoscopy ', ' endoscopic imaging ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Oregon ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Population ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training Support ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Vendor ', ' Measures ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Rural Community ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Caring ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Native Americans ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' outreach ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient registry ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' practice-based research network ', ' implementation trial ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' aged ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer patients ', ' colorectal cancer patients ', ' colon cancer patients ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' project dissemination ', ' program dissemination ', ' webinar ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' frontier counties ', ' rural environment ', ' rural counties ', ' rural underserved ', ' rural locality ', ' rural place ', ' rural setting ', ' recruit ', ' health plans ', ' health plan ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' patient engagement ', ' patient outreach ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' screening disparities ', ' Infrastructure ', ' effectiveness implementation trial ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,UH3,2020,1135664,0.09715626751270276
"Increasing Access and Developing Predictors for Colorectal Cancer Screening for Minority and Medicaid Clients ABSTRACT African Americans have 22% higher incidence and 49% higher death rates from CRC than any other ethnic/racial group. Similarly, lower socioeconomic status (SES) is also associated with higher CRC incidence and mortality. Both of these groups are overrepresented in Medicaid populations. Screening colonoscopy is a cost-effective cancer prevention and control strategy, leading to CRC prevention (e.g., removal of precancerous polyps), earlier CRC detection and therefore higher survival rates. For patients preferring or needing alternatives, fecal tests are reliable alternatives (e.g., FIT). However, numerous individual and structural barriers often reduce client adherence to screening guidelines resulting in “gaps in care,” increasing costs of treatment and lower quality metrics (e.g., Medicare Star and HEDIS® scores) for the health insurance companies and providers. Insured, non-adherent patients are considered a strategic priority for insurers. The mission of Witness CARES, LLC, is to help improve people's lives by facilitating use of health care. The product to be developed in this STTR Phase I study is a specialized set of services and electronic prototype tool (i.e., WC Services) to optimize and predict CRC screening for Medicaid clients based on our behavioral research, intervention development and delivery through a not-for-profit organization. We will provide personalized, culturally/racially-customized services for insured client end-users while improving national metrics and cost-effective access for the health insurance company and health care provider customers. The technological innovation is development of a computer-based assessment tool (i.e., Screening Engagement Model) allowing us to tailor messaging and type of screening test (FIT or colonoscopy) to client preferences, with the goal of increasing rates of screening for these clients and reducing colonoscopy no-shows for GI facilities. Successful creation of this product will reduce gaps in care for health insurers and reduce disparities in CRC mortality. To move forward, we need to 1) prove that this product can be delivered outside an individual clinical setting and significantly reduce gaps in care; and 2) develop a predictive model for determining which patients are best served by navigation to colonoscopy versus a stool test. The goal of this Phase I application is to prove the feasibility and small scale pilot efficacy of WC Services to increase CRC screening. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Test the feasibility of WC Services to achieve CRC screening for non-adherent Medicaid clients. Milestone 1a: Achieve either colonoscopy or stool screening by a minimum of 130 of 200 (65%) patients contacted. Milestone 1b: Produce a new prototype to test in Phase II. Aim 2: Develop an algorithm for predicting CRC screening outcomes. Milestone 2a: Develop models based on existing R01 data to predict intent and CRC screening behaviors. Milestone 2b: Revise this R01 model with new measures collected prospectively from 80% of clients contacted (n=160) to identify likelihood of stool test v. colonoscopy completion. Milestone 2c: Develop a revised prototype into a complete WC Services product. NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health because it studies the feasiblity of developing a business model to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening for African Americans and lower income Medicaid/Medicare patients who have an excess incidence and mortality rate from this disease. The proposed study is relevant to the NIH mission pertaining to support of knowledge and research that will help reduce CRC health disparities. Moreover, demonstrating the commercial potential for these services provides the opportunity to significantly increase dissemination of effective, evidence-based outreach and navigation to reduce CRC disparities.",Increasing Access and Developing Predictors for Colorectal Cancer Screening for Minority and Medicaid Clients,10091591,R41CA232824,"['Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Client ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Computers ', ' Contacting Client ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Incidence ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Death Rate ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' CRC prevention ', ' colo-rectal cancer prevention ', ' prevent colo-rectal cancer ', ' prevent colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' tool ', ' Non-adherent patient ', ' Nonadherent patient ', ' Patient Non Compliance ', ' Patient Non-Adherence ', ' Patient Nonadherence ', ' Patient Noncompliance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' technological innovation ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' STTR ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' tailored messaging ', ' service intervention ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' screening ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' colo-rectal cancer therapy ', ' colo-rectal cancer treatment ', ' colorectal cancer therapy ', ' colorectal cancer treatment ', ' public insurance ', ' public health insurance ', ' screening disparities ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' screening guidelines ', ' ']",NCI,"WITNESS CARES, LLC",R41,2020,55000,0.26325297876667264
"Participatory Research to Advance Colon Cancer Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer death in the United States. This is troubling given that screening rates are marked by a pronounced disparity, with Latinos who have been in the United States for fewer than 10 years and the uninsured having the lowest rates. These individuals generally receive care at one of over 1,200 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) that serve over 21 million persons nationwide. While colorectal cancer screening rates among FQHC patients are a cause for great concern, studies have demonstrated success for improving screening rates. Programs that mail fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) kits with pictograph instructions to eligible patients report higher screening rates. While new technologies, such as automated phone calls and text messages, have been explored to remind patients to complete screening, little is known about their effectiveness in diverse populations. Moreover, such programs often adopt a one-size fits all approach and their effectiveness has not been tested among subgroups least likely to be screened. To address these issues, we will work with the advisory board assembled for our successful STOP CRC project and additional community stakeholders to adapt and spread a direct-mail FIT and reminder program (PROMPT) in two phases. In Phase I, we will design and evaluate a randomized controlled trial to test systems-based, automated and non-automated strategies to increase colorectal cancer screening in an FQHC with diverse patient populations. In Phase II, we will assess the spread of the program to 11 clinics (estimated age-eligible patient population ~ 22,000). The proposed study's design and evaluation will be guided by the RE-AIM framework using intervention mapping and will involve low-income and ethnically diverse patients who are served by Yakima Valley Farmworkers Clinic. PROMPT will be the first trial to sequentially test the effectiveness of reminders to a direct-mail colorectal cancer screening program, then spread the selected best practice to additional clinics within the FQHC network. PROMPT will apply novel and locally develop strategies to engage stakeholders in adapting the intervetion, defining the intervention components, and selecting a best practice for spread. If the trial succeeds, it will have broad- scale implementation potential for a similar program to decrease cancer screening disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE About half of the adults in the U.S. who should get screened for colorectal cancer do not get screened. Clinics that mail fecal tests to patients who are due for screening can increase screening rates and reduce screening disparities. With the goal of catching and treating cancers early, we will use a novel participatory approach to test reminders to a mailing program then test the spread of the program throughout a community clinic network.",Participatory Research to Advance Colon Cancer Prevention,10018533,U01MD010665,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Persons ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' Home visitation ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient population ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' Yakima Valley ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' screening program ', ' prevent colon cancer ', ' colon cancer prevention ', ' colon cancer detection ', ' detect colon cancer ', ' colon cancer screening ', ' patient portal ', ' screening disparities ', ' usual care control group ', ' usual care arm ', ' community clinic ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIMHD,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2020,125000,0.1549740595718301
"Scaling Colorectal Cancer Screening Through Outreach, Referral, and Engagement (SCORE): A State-Level Program to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Burden in Vulnerable Populations Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section PROJECT SUMMARY Despite strong evidence that colorectal cancer (CRC) screening reduces mortality, rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care (herein referred to as “CRC screening”) remain suboptimal in the US. In North Carolina (NC), underuse of screening contributes to particularly high CRC burden in certain regions. Community health centers (CHCs) play a critical role in providing CRC screening for these vulnerable populations. Yet, CRC screening rates in NC CHCs are well below the estimated national rate of 62%. Substantial efforts are needed to reach the national target of 80%. Because multiple patient-, provider-, and system-level factors contribute to low screening rates, multilevel interventions are needed to achieve screening targets. Accumulating evidence shows that interventions involving mailed screening outreach, practice-based screening in-reach (using patient navigators), and systematically improving colonoscopy access, all increase screening. However, in practice, CHCs face substantial resource limitations and lack the means to systematically implement a multi-level intervention of outreach, in-reach, and improved colonoscopy access for uninsured patients. Until a multi-level intervention is shown to be both effective and cost-effective from stakeholder perspectives, screening rates will remain low, leaving thousands of vulnerable patients at risk. We hypothesize that standardizing these interventions for CHCs at the state-level will yield cost-effective approaches to increasing screening. Our long-term goal is to reduce CRC burden and disparities through improved screening. Our objective here is to leverage our expertise in CRC screening intervention research, implementation science, stakeholder engagement, and modeling to achieve this goal for our state. Our central hypothesis is that a pragmatic trial assessing impacts and costs for combinations of these evidence-based interventions (EBIs) will yield one or more strategies that stakeholders find to be cost-effective and sustainable. The specific aims for our study are: Aim 1 (Planning and Exploratory Phase): Pilot test a multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening in vulnerable populations in three NC regions. In this phase, we will complete pilot studies needed for our signature trial, plan for implementation evaluation and sustainability, and develop a process for evaluating locally-developed innovative approaches for improving screening. Aim 2 (Implementation Phase): Building on Aim 1 findings, implement and evaluate multilevel CRC screening approaches in vulnerable populations in NC. In this phase, we will conduct our signature trial, assess implementation outcomes, evaluate the use of stakeholder-engaged modeling for sustaining and scaling the multilevel intervention, and select and evaluate locally-developed innovations for improving screening.

"A Multilevel CBPR Intervention to Improve Colorectal Cancer Screening in Underserved Vietnamese Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third highest cause of mortality in Vietnamese and Asian Americans. CRC incidence is rising rapidly in Vietnamese Americans, but they have among the lowest rates of CRC screening (14%) and are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease, which is highly preventable. Over 85% of Vietnamese Americans in our region (PA, NJ and NYC) are foreign-born with limited English proficiency, have low SES, and live in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Many lack knowledge about CRC risks and screening benefits, and have limited access to culturally appropriate preventive care. Thus, a multilevel intervention is needed to address the multiple barriers to and determinants of CRC screening in this community. Vietnamese community organizations (VCOs) serve dynamic social functions and represent an important resource for addressing this critical health disparity priority by promoting CRC screening. This project builds on established partnerships and successful work of Center for Asian Health, Temple University with Vietnamese CBOs that address their critical health disparities. CBPR principles will be applied to engage 20 VCOs in all phases of planning, implementing, evaluating, and disseminating a culturally appropriate, theory- and evidence-based multilevel CRC intervention. The proposed intervention will be guided by Social Ecological Model, which addresses sociocultural, behavioral and environmental determinants and intervention strategies at individual, interpersonal, and community organizational levels. CDC's Clinical Preventive Services Guidelines for adults 50+ (CPS) recommend that cancer screenings and other preventive services should be promoted. The standard CPS will be provided to both intervention and control groups, and intervention group will receive CPS + multilevel CRC intervention. Specific Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that CPS + multilevel CRC intervention will yield higher CRC screening rates compared to CPS control at 12-month follow up; Aim 2 is to examine whether CPS + multilevel CRC intervention (which includes CHW-led group education, automated and interactive text messaging and phone-based peer support) is more effective in changing screening determinants (e.g. KAB, self-efficacy, risk factors, lifestyles, social support, social norms, access barriers) than CPS control condition; and Aim 3 is to assess costs and cost-effectiveness of CPS + multilevel CRC intervention compared to CPS control condition in relation to CRC screening rates in order to inform future dissemination efforts. In sum, this project represents the first large-scale community-based randomized controlled trial of a multilevel, culturally-appropriate CBPR intervention to increase CRC screening among underserved Vietnamese. If effective, this innovative multilevel CRC intervention can be used as a model program that has potential generalizability and sustainability in Asian American and other underserved ethnic communities to impact preventive behaviors at population level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in Vietnamese Americans (VAs) but they have among the lowest rates of CRC screening (14%) and are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease, which is highly preventable. Although promoting preventive care for at-risk populations is a public health priority, little is known about effective CRC screening intervention for the fast-growing and undeserved VAs and this project aims to determine the effectiveness of a multilevel, theory- and evidence- based CBPR intervention to increase CRC screening in underserved VAs. This innovative multilevel intervention is the first of its kind in the US that is tailored to the speciic needs, characteristics and assets of this disparity population, and has potential

"Role of Circadian Factors in Inflammation and Colorectal Adenoma Risk Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common and deadly forms of cancer. In South Carolina, our group has documented racial CRC disparities that exceed national rates. Most colon tumors arise from adenomas (adenomatous polyps) that are detected via a screening colonoscopy. Gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation and aberrant DNA methylation are key processes driving adenoma formation and CRC risk. Sleep loss and circadian rhythm disruption can induce inflammation, alter DNA methylation, and increase CRC risk. African- Americans (AAs) differ from European-Americans (EAs) in their endogenous circadian timing, and they are more likely than EAs to have poor sleep and excessive stress (allostatic overload or ‘weathering’). This case- control study will test the hypothesis that disruption of circadian processes and sleep is associated with inflammation and adenoma risk among AA and EA patients receiving a screening colonoscopy. Molecular timekeeping is controlled by ‘clock genes’ that regulate circadian gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms. Clock genes can modulate inflammation (e.g., TNFα, IL-6 expression), and they act as tumor suppressors (e.g., the ‘Period’ or PER genes). Our research suggests that genetic variation or aberrant methylation in PER genes is associated with increased adenoma risk, and that sleep disorders can increase CRC risk. Melatonin is a clock-regulated hormone that suppresses GI inflammation and inhibits colon tumor growth by binding to its cellular receptors (MT-1, RORα). This study will characterize biobehavioral circadian disruption indicators (sleep disturbances, social jet lag, fatigue, stress), along with key molecular correlates (PER3 genotype and methylation of: clock genes [PER1, PER2, PER3]; clock-controlled genes [MT-1, RORα, TNFα, IL-6]; and global DNA methylation [LINE-1]) to determine their role in inflammation and adenoma risk. A biobehavioral framework will address the following Specific Aims: 1) Conduct a case-control study among patients undergoing a screening colonoscopy to determine whether circadian disruption indicators (DNA methylation, biobehavioral, genetic) are associated with adenoma case status relative to controls, and if the relationship is modified by race (N=1,000; 400 cases, 600 controls); 2) Determine if circadian disruption indicators are associated with inflammation in normal GI tissue (TNFα, IL-6 mRNA expression); 3) Determine whether behavioral and molecular circadian disruption indicators are related; 4) Among adenoma cases, determine if methylation of candidate circadian genes in adenomas differs from normal GI tissue. Our team has a strong track record of providing high quality colonoscopy services and in engaging AA and EA communities in research. Prospective data collection (relative to colonoscopy) and the use of valid, quantitative biobehavioral and molecular measures will limit the potential introduction of bias. This study will rigorously examine circadian-based behavioral and molecular risk factors as they relate to GI inflammation and colorectal adenoma risk. Circadian-based risk factors may serve as novel, modifiable targets for CRC prevention. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common and deadly forms of cancer, and the racial CRC disparity in South Carolina exceeds the national average. This study will use a biobehavioral case-control design to determine whether the disruption of circadian rhythms and sleep, including their genetic and epigenetic (DNA methylation) correlates, is associated with inflammation or colorectal adenomas among African- and European- American patients receiving a screening colonoscopy. Our study will rigorously evaluate whether circadian- based factors may serve as novel, modifiable targets for CRC prevention.",Role of Circadian Factors in Inflammation and Colorectal Adenoma

"Enhancing Prevention Pathways Towards Tribal Colorectal Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) experience significant health inequities and disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) related incidence, mortality, stage at diagnosis, and survival. Recent reductions in CRC incidence and mortality rates and improvements in stage at diagnosis and survival rates in the general U.S. population have been attributed to routine screening with prompt removal of polyps, early detection, and timely and appropriate treatment. AI/ANs are significantly less likely than non-Hispanic Whites to receive timely and risk- and age-appropriate cancer screenings, including recommended CRC screening. The short-term goal is to test the efficacy of serially implemented interventions designed to enhance annual CRC screening using the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Serial implementation refers to offering routine screening, irrespective of response to an earlier invitation, in concordance with national guidelines which recommend annual FIT testing between ages 50-75. The FIT is most appropriate because, based on consensus guidelines, it is an approved, high sensitivity fecal occult blood test that is offered annually and is available in Indian Health Service and tribal health facilities where resources to provide screening colonoscopy are limited. We will follow all positive FIT results with timely and appropriate diagnostic and treatment services. We address screening disparities through the testing of interventions designed to enhance annual CRC screening using the FIT among average- risk, on-reservation AIs aged 50-75 in the rural Southwest. The interventions are theory-informed, evidence- based, and graded in their intensity. The high intensity intervention will include navigated outreach, a mailed FIT kit, educational material, and follow-up reminders (Study Group 1). The medium intensity intervention will include a mailed FIT kit, educational material, and follow-up reminders (Study Group 2). The reference group (Study Group 3) will receive usual care (screening recommendation and a FIT kit at a clinic visit). We will use rigorous research methods to: (a) determine the efficacy of interventions to enhance annual CRC screening through completion of the FIT kit; (b) understand contextually relevant factors important for behavior change; (c) identify the most cost-effective strategies to enhance routine CRC screening; and (d) develop plans to inform sustainability and scalability. This is a collaborative effort between the University of New Mexico, the Albuquerque Area Indian Health Board (100% Indian-owned and operated), and six Pueblo Tribes in the rural Southwest. The research team has an extensive and successful history of conducting community based participatory cancer prevention research in collaboration with AI communities. Moreover, the research team recognizes the value of integrating a co-learning process and engaging in trust-based mutually beneficial research. Findings from this research could lead to an immediate increase in CRC screening and ultimately reduce the CRC disease burden among AIs experiencing cancer disparities and health inequities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age- and risk-appropriate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening coupled with prompt removal of polyps, early detection, and timely and appropriate treatment can reduce CRC incidence and mortality, detect and diagnose CRC at an earlier stage, and improve survival. However, American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have not benefitted equally from these gains in CRC control. To the best of our knowledge, no research has tested, with scientific and methodological rigor, strategies to enhance CRC screening among AIs. Documenting the efficacy of serially implemented CRC interventions designed to enhance the annual uptake of CRC screening tests among AIs can lead to broad implementation of evidence-based CRC screening interventions that could ultimately address the national and tribal priority of reducing CRC disparities among AIs.",Enhancing Prevention Pathways Towards Tribal Colorectal Health,10000851,R01CA192967,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' assess cost ', ' cost assessment ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Services ', ' diagnosis service ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Physician Executives ', ' Medical Directors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' New Mexico ', ' Polyps ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' United States Indian Health Service ', ' Indian Health Service ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' Rural ', ' Program Sustainabilities ', ' Program Sustainability ', ' uptake ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Consensus ', ' Test Result ', ' behavior change ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' colorectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' meetings ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' American Indian reservation ', ' nation reservation ', ' native american reservation ', ' reservation community ', ' tribal reservation ', ' Indian reservation ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaska Native ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Address ', ' tribe health ', ' tribal health ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Reservations ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Pueblo ', ' Pueblo Race ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Coupled ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' efficacy testing ', ' health equity ', ' arm ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' trial design ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' rural Americans ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' annual screening ', ' routine screening ', ' screening disparities ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' screening guidelines ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,R01,2020,551340,0.2943049524030131
"MUC13 Mucin in Colerectal Cancer Health Disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most lethal malignancy in the USA and affects over a million people every year. A significant CRC health disparity exists between African Americans (AA), American Indians (AI) and Caucasians (CA) in relation to its occurrence, drug response and mortality. Due to this, the overall mortality is highr among AA/AI compared to CA. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this disparity in AA/AI are not known. Therefore, it is highly imperative to understand the molecular basis and the identification of biomarker(s) that can be used for early stage diagnosis, metastasis and drug response to reduce this unacceptable health disparity. Our laboratory has identified a novel transmembrane mucin, MUC13, which is highly overexpressed/aberrantly localized in CRC and is involved in its pathogenesis. Additionally, our recent preliminary data suggest a markedly higher and aberrant expression of MUC13 in AA/AI CRC samples compared to CA counter parts. We have shown that MUC13 is an important modulator of several signal-transduction pathways and affects multiple key proteins involved in cell growth and survival, such as sonic hedgehog, HER2 and p53. Our published and preliminary studies have suggested an aberrant expression of MUC13 which has implications in CRC progression and metastasis. Based on these compelling evidence, we hypothesize that the differential/aberrant expression of MUC13 and/or MUC13 variants are underlying factors associated with CRC health disparity. In addition, we hypothesize this differential MUC13 expression is regulated by certain microRNAs (miR-145 and miR-132) and inflammatory mediators produced by the tumor microenvironment (e.g. interleukin-6 mediated STAT5B phosphorylation) resulting in malignant colorectal cancer cells phenotypes among AA/AI populations. Three specific aims with comprehensive experimental approach are proposed to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we propose to study the expression profile of MUC13 in Caucasians, African Americans and American Indians CRC tissues and its correlation with disease progression, metastasis and patient survival. Aim 2 will investigate the presence of MUC13 spliced variants/single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their association with chemoresistance, metastasis and CRC health disparity. Aim 3 intends to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of MUC13 regulation in clinically relevant CRC tissues and cell line models. We will also investigate how various intrinsic factors can induce aberrant/ altered subcellular localization of MUC13, in clinically relevant CRC cell line models, as aberrant subcellular localization (cytoplasmic, nuclear) of MUC13 has also been associated with disease stage, prognosis and metastasis. The results of this multi factorial study will determine if MUC13 can be used as a molecular signature for early detection of aggressive and metastatic CRC in AA and AI. This comprehensive study will further provide important insights regarding MUC13 etiology in CRC and help in designing preventive and therapeutic strategies to reduce CRC mortality and CRC health disparity in underserved populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Underserved populations such as African Americans (AA) and American Indians (AI) are experiencing increasing prevalence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC), thus understanding the molecular basis of this disparity and the identification of molecular signatures that can be used for early stage diagnosis are highly desirable.

"Participatory Research to Advance Colon Cancer Prevention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer death in the United States. This is troubling given that screening rates are marked by a pronounced disparity, with Latinos who have been in the United States for fewer than 10 years and the uninsured having the lowest rates. These individuals generally receive care at one of over 1,200 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) that serve over 21 million persons nationwide. While colorectal cancer screening rates among FQHC patients are a cause for great concern, studies have demonstrated success for improving screening rates. Programs that mail fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) kits with pictograph instructions to eligible patients report higher screening rates. While new technologies, such as automated phone calls and text messages, have been explored to remind patients to complete screening, little is known about their effectiveness in diverse populations. Moreover, such programs often adopt a one-size fits all approach and their effectiveness has not been tested among subgroups least likely to be screened. To address these issues, we will work with the advisory board assembled for our successful STOP CRC project and additional community stakeholders to adapt and spread a direct-mail FIT and reminder program (PROMPT) in two phases. In Phase I, we will design and evaluate a randomized controlled trial to test systems-based, automated and non-automated strategies to increase colorectal cancer screening in an FQHC with diverse patient populations. In Phase II, we will assess the spread of the program to 11 clinics (estimated age-eligible patient population ~ 22,000). The proposed study's design and evaluation will be guided by the RE-AIM framework using intervention mapping and will involve low-income and ethnically diverse patients who are served by Yakima Valley Farmworkers Clinic. PROMPT will be the first trial to sequentially test the effectiveness of reminders to a direct-mail colorectal cancer screening program, then spread the selected best practice to additional clinics within the FQHC network. PROMPT will apply novel and locally develop strategies to engage stakeholders in adapting the intervention, defining the intervention components, and selecting a best practice for spread. If the trial succeeds, it will have broad-scale implementation potential for a similar program to decrease cancer screening disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About half of the adults in the U.S. who should get screened for colorectal cancer do not get screened. Clinics that mail fecal tests to patients who are due for screening can increase screening rates and reduce screening disparities. With the goal of catching and treating cancers early, we will use a novel participatory approach to test reminders to a mailing program then test the spread of the program throughout a community clinic network.",Participatory Research to Advance Colon Cancer Prevention,9928745,U01MD010665,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Persons ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' Home visitation ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' Yakima Valley ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' screening program ', ' prevent colon cancer ', ' colon cancer prevention ', ' colon cancer detection ', ' detect colon cancer ', ' colon cancer screening ', ' patient portal ', ' screening disparities ', ' usual care control group ', ' usual care arm ', ' community clinic ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIMHD,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2020,450271,0.15593507223508793
"Novel randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in patients with colorectal cancer: Impact on survival and biology PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Abundant preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that vitamin D possesses anti-neoplastic activity, and that individuals with higher plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels have lower risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and improved survival from CRC. Despite compelling evidence implicating vitamin D in CRC, critical questions remain about whether these findings reflect a true causal relationship, and what the biological mech- anisms of vitamin D activity are. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation to achieve sufficient levels of 25(OH)D leads to improved survival in CRC patients and influences several neoplastic pathways that can be exploited as biomarkers of efficacy and targets for novel treatment strategies. We will test this hypothe- sis within two novel randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation: a) a phase II double-blind random- ized trial of high- versus low-dose vitamin D3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic CRC, and b) a randomized trial of preoperative high-dose vitamin D3 versus placebo in patients with resectable colon cancer for examination of vitamin D biology in fresh human tumor tissue. We will also lever- age a rich prospective cohort of metastatic CRC patients enrolled in a completed NCI-sponsored phase III trial of chemotherapy (CALGB/SWOG 80405) to further define and validate biomarkers of vitamin D action. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of supplemental vitamin D on survival of CRC patients, test distinct hypotheses about the vitamin D dose-response relationship, and explore biomarkers of vitamin D status, response, and efficacy. We will investigate whether circulating levels of vitamin D binding protein and tumoral expression of vitamin D receptor, 1α-hydroxylase, and 24-hydroxylase are associated with improved survival within our ran- domized trials, and whether these markers modify the relationship between vitamin D and patient outcome. In Aim 2, we will conduct a precision medicine analysis of vitamin D to elucidate the mechanistic basis for its anti- tumor activity in CRC. We will explore the impact of vitamin D supplementation on tumoral markers of inflam- mation, lymphocytic infiltrates, and inflammatory gene signatures in surgical colectomy specimens from pa- tients treated with high-dose preoperative vitamin D3 versus placebo. We will also perform next generation se- quencing and Nanostring analysis of tumors from CRC patients with high- versus low vitamin D status to identi- fy unique genetic and transcriptional signatures associated with vitamin D-mediated carcinogenesis. In sum- mary, this translational proposal leverages innovative randomized trials of vitamin D to take the next critical steps in understanding vitamin D activity and biology in CRC. Our findings will confirm causality, provide new insights into biomarkers of vitamin D activity, and lead to potential inclusion of vitamin D into standard therapy – including immunotherapy – with the ultimate goal of improving the survival of patients with CRC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S., and may plausibly be linked to vitamin D deficiency. Abundant preclinical and epide- miologic data link lower levels of vitamin D to increased risk of and mortality from colorectal cancer; this is par- ticularly relevant given increasing rates of vitamin D deficiency in the U.S., as well as profound racial disparities in vitamin D status and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. In an era of expensive and often toxic anti- neoplastic drugs, vitamin D therefore represents an attractive and accessible treatment option for patients of all races and sociodemographic groups with

"Implementing multilevel colon cancer screening interventions to reduce rural cancer disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many rural communities are medically underserved and experience persistently elevated rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality relative to declining national rates. Routine screening reduces population CRC mortality, yet its impact is reduced because many adults who have an abnormal screening result with fecal testing do not receive diagnostic follow-up with colonoscopy. Rural residents and healthcare providers face unique barriers to screening follow-up including fewer providers who offer colonoscopy and longer travel distances to obtain healthcare. Rural Southern Illinois is a region with high poverty, slow economic growth, isolated households, widely dispersed medical care, and high CRC mortality. To reduce disparities in CRC mortality in rural areas where fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) is a common first-line screening strategy, we must identify effective, sustainable, and disseminable strategies to improve follow-up of positive screening tests. Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine have collaborated with Southern Illinois Healthcare, a rural not-for-profit health system, since 2015 to identify cancer prevention and control priorities and reduce disparities. From 2017 to 2018, we conducted a formal pre-implementation assessment of CRC screening and follow-up processes to identify feasible and promising evidence-based interventions and strategies for improvement. Based on our substantial and specific preliminary data, we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement a multilevel intervention of follow-up of abnormal colon cancer screening tests in primary care clinics across rural Southern Illinois. Using a stepped wedge trial design and cluster randomization, we will implement the multi-level intervention in 18 clinics. We will intervene at three levels (patients, providers/clinical teams, clinics) and evaluate implementation outcomes per Proctor's evaluation model using interviews, surveys, and field notes. Aim 2. Evaluate the impact of the multilevel intervention on follow-up of abnormal screening test results in rural primary care settings in Southern Illinois. Our stepped-wedge design will allow us to test the impact of the multi-level intervention on rates of screening follow-up. We measure outcomes at three levels. Patient: After positive FIT, receipt of referral and completion of colonoscopy. Primary Care Provider: Receipt of positive FIT results and referral for follow-up. Clinic-level: Patients with positive FIT complete colonoscopy. We will assess change in CRC screening rates and investigate interactions between and across levels. Data for primary outcomes will come from the healthcare system's ongoing patient registry that draws from electronic medical records and lab records. The co- construction of this proposal between university researchers and health system stakeholders enhances the potential for significant and sustainable change for effective and efficient screening and early detection. There is a critical need for real-world strategies that can function within rural community health systems to improve health and reduce disparities. NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer death. Screening is effective at reducing colorectal cancer mortality, but is limited when patients who screen positive do not receive complete diagnostic follow-up. This study tests a multi-level intervention to promote evaluation and follow-up of positive colorectal cancer screening tests in a rural area that is medically underserved and has high rates of colorectal cancer mortality compared to urban and suburban areas.",Implementing multilevel colon cancer screening interventions to reduce rural cancer disparities,9977989,R01CA233848,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Health Catchment Area ', ' Service area ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Household ', ' Illinois ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' Mississippi ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Records ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Process Measure ', ' Rural Community ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' suburban ', ' suburbia ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Rural ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' uptake ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Rivers ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Clinic ', ' Test Result ', ' behavior change ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Fecal Occult Blood Test ', ' Guaiac Smear Test ', ' Hemoccult ', ' Stool guaiac test ', ' heme occult blood test ', ' Fecal occult blood ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient registry ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Screening Result ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' tv watching ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' medically underserved ', ' implementation science ', ' primary care setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' screening ', ' trial design ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' rural health care ', ' rural healthcare ', ' rural resident ', ' rural dwellers ', ' rural underserved ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' colon cancer detection ', ' detect colon cancer ', ' colon cancer screening ', ' annual screening ', ' routine screening ', ' data diversity ', ' diverse data ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,679849,0.21157960238446033
"Colorectal cancer disparities:Racial differences in colorectal adenopolyps and altered expression of Mitochondrial genes Abstract: Regardless of race, 50 years of age is the current screening recommendations for colorectal cancer (CRC) disease based on an assumption that the prevailing CRC disparities are relatively due to differences in access to quality screening and the post diagnostic therapies. However, several lines of evidence have suggested that in younger age groups, AA have twice the CRC incidence rate as Whites, and their stage- adjusted CRC survival rates are lower than Whites. Given that most CRCs arise from precancerous of adenomatous polyps (adenopolyps) that evolve into invasive adenocarcinoma, it is plausible that certain “modifying” genes expression may potentially responsible for the observation in AA experience to earlier adenopolyps initiation and more rapid adenopolyps progression to adenocarcinoma. If such is the case, one potential factor in the persistent of CRC disparities may be the race-nonconforming/or neutral age guideline for screening initiation. Studies regarding age-related AA-White differences in CRC progression through the intermediate stages (polyp sizes of tubular, tubulovillous, and villous, and dysplastic histology) are needed. To establish such evidence, it requires genetic alteration study in a modifying gene(s) and a tissue source representing the colorectal adenopolyp prevalence and profile in the population from a large enough autopsy sample size with complete adenopolyps clearance and having complete colorectal adenopolyps documentation. Our study will leverage a unique of 640 colorectal adenopolyp/ cancer cases and 1280 control tissue samples in a frequency matched nested case-control within our lab and Southern Division Co-operative Human tissues Network at University of Alabama collected through previous NIH-funded studies. The sample size has sufficient statistical power to compare AA and Whites on precancerous of colorectal adenopolyps prevalence and cancer-relevant features with difference age strata. These tissue collections are large and well-annotated by micro-dissection. Our laboratory recently demonstrated that there were progressive increase of mitochondrial gene expressions in colorectal adenopolyps and carcinomas when compared to their normal surrounding tissues (accepted paper Tumor Biology #TUBI-16-00926R1), suggesting that certain mt-genes expression are involved in the malignancy of colorectal adenopolyps to invasive adenocarcinoma. Based on these data, the central hypothesis of this project is that over-expression of certain mt-genes play a role in the aggressiveness of precancerous colorectal tumor behavior within younger AA which are reflected in their high incidence and low survival rate of this disease. To test this hypothesis, we will determine the level of mt-genes alterations in colorectal adenopolyps between AA-White subgroups. Also, we will evaluate our results relative to AA-White differences within 10 year age strata and their related features (size, histology, anatomic location, dysplasia status, and adenocarcinoma), as well as body mass index (BMI) using univariate statistical tests, multiple regression and cluster analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans (AA) have twice the CRC incidence rate as Whites, and survival rates are lower than Whites. Studies linking rapid colorectal polyps progression to cancer among AA Individual younger than 50 years old are lacking. This study will explore mitochondrial genes expression in colorectal adenopolyp tissue samples obtained from AA and white of difference age strata and results could potentially facilitate changes in the recommended screening age.",Colorectal cancer disparities:Racial differences in colorectal adenopolyps and altered expression of Mitochondrial genes,9948685,SC3GM122669,"['Adenocarcinoma ', '

"Vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk: an integrated molecular and genetic epidemiologic study PROJECT ABSTRACT This K99/R00 Career Development Award will provide the applicant, Dr. Warren Andersen, with the research experience and training to propel her into a career as an independent investigator in the field of genetic and molecular epidemiology with a focus on the interplay between race, modifiable risk factors, and the genetic determinants of cancer risk and outcomes. The research plan uses Mendelian randomization methods to evaluate the hypothesis that circulating and bioavailable vitamin D levels are associated with decreased colorectal cancer risk. Mendelian randomization (MR) methods can be used to evaluate the associations between long-term exposures and diseases by using genetic variants as instrumental variables in place of exposures. Dr. Warren Andersen will also assess whether vitamin D binding protein modifies the association between vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk. The project will leverage resources from three established epidemiologic consortia (the ColoRectal Transdisciplinary Study (CORECT) consortium, a colorectal cancer genome-wide association study consortium among African Americans, and the Asia Colorectal Cancer Consortium) and the Southern Community Cohort Study to evaluate associations in large samples including individuals of European, Asian and African descent. Dr. Warren Andersen will create race-specific genetic scores to represent circulating vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein. Fine-mapping will be conducted to identify potentially causal variants to be included in the vitamin D genetic scores. These genetic scores will then be assessed for associations with overall colorectal cancer risk, and colorectal cancer risk stratified by specific characteristics of the tumor such as COX-2 expression, PIK3CA mutation status, and stage. During the Career Development Award Dr. Warren Andersen will gain additional skills in genetic analysis and increase her knowledge in colorectal cancer biology and health disparities. The findings from this research project will be used to develop and submit two R01 level projects before the completion of the Career Development Award. The additional experience gained from this Career Development Award will prepare Dr. Warren Andersen to be a leader in the field of genetic and molecular epidemiology of cancer, with expertise in colorectal cancer etiology, genetic and cancer epidemiology, and the root causes of racial differences in disease risk. This research topic is of much significance, as the Institute of Medicine's 2010 Report stated, investigation into the causal relationships between vitamin D and total and site-specific cancers is an important research need. The use of MR and molecular epidemiologic methods should provide a more definitive answer to the questions of the relationships of colorectal cancer risk with circulating vitamin D, bioavailable vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein. This study will provide insight into colorectal cancer etiology and potentially identify subgroups of individuals who may benefit the most from vitamin D supplementation. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to conduct a large molecular epidemiologic study using fine-mapping and Mendelian randomization methods in Whites, Asians, and African Americans to provide more definitive evidence regarding the association of circulating vitamin D and vitamin D binding protein with colorectal cancer risk. We will further study tumor markers to investigate possible mechanisms for the associations. This study will improve our understanding of colorectal cancer etiology and provide valuable data for designing cost-efficient measures to reduce the risk of this common malignancy.",Vitamin D and

"Alcohol, Gut Dysbiosis, Endotoxemia, and Colorectal Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Alcohol consumption has been linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully defined. Emerging evidence from animal studies suggest that alcohol associated gut dysbiosis and subsequent gut barrier dysfunctions and endotoxemia may be an important and underexplored pathway. However, the impact of long-term alcohol intake on not only the taxonomic makeup but also the functional capacity of the gut microbiome among healthy individuals has not been established, and how these dysbiosis will influence colorectal carcinogenesis remain unknown. Alcohol-associated passage of luminal endotoxin into systemic circulation is hypothesized to activate both adaptive and innate immune systems characterized by a release of antibodies, cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators, which may increase subsequent risk of inflammation related diseases, including obesity, and diabetes, both of which are well-established risk factors for CRC. However, the role of endotoxemia in colorectal carcinogenesis has not been studied. We therefore hypothesize that long-term alcohol intake induce gut dysbiosis, impair the gut barrier function, and followed by endotoxemia and inflammation to increase risk of CRC. We will test this hypothesis leveraging rich data collected a large and well-characterized prospective cohort (the Health Professional Follow-up Study) with a healthy sub-cohort with stool collection and metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiling (Aim 1a) and 250 nested CRC cases and 250 controls with archived pre- diagnostic blood and ongoing plasma proteomic profiling (Aim 1b and 1c). Specifically, we will investigate whether long-term alcohol intake induce gut dysbiosis through perturbations in microbial composition (e.g. Proteobacteria) and function of tumor-permissive immune signatures and procarcinogenic pathways among healthy individuals (Aim 1a). We will also investigate whether alcohol-associated colorectal carcinogenesis is mediated by gut barrier dysfunction and endotoxemia through first identifying circulating markers of gut wall integrity loss, bacteria translocation, endotoxemia, inflammation associated with alcohol intake (Aim 1b), and then investigate their associations with subsequent risk of CRC (Aim 1c). Our findings will provide novel mechanistic insight into gut microbial and endotoxemia mediated pathogenesis of alcohol-related CRCs. We will also provide clinically translatable data including specific microbial targets, and circulating biomarkers and network that reflect susceptibilities to subsequent risk of alcohol-related CRCs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol consumption is common in the United States. Moderate to heavy alcohol intake increases risk of colorectal cancer with mechanisms yet to be fully defined. Bacterial microbiota may contribute to the metabolism of alcohol and may mediate many of the disease-promoting and genotoxic effects of alcohol, however human data has been limited. Our investigation into the role of gut dysbiosis and endotoxemia in mediating the link between alcohol and colorectal cancer in a well-characterized prospective cohort study will provide novel and new understanding of this emerging pathway, and shed light on microbial targets and/or circulating markers that are of therapeutic and preventive potential.","Alcohol, Gut Dysbiosis, Endotoxemia, and

"Genetics of Tumor Suppression by p53 PROJECT SUMMARY The goals of this Pathway to Independence Career Development proposal are to gain expertise in colorectal cancer (CRC), population science, and experimental therapeutics, with a focus on the development of novel therapeutic strategies for CRC, dependent on the status of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, TP53. The training plan outlined in this proposal will take full advantage of the extensive resources and scientific expertise at The Wistar Institute, and incorporates training with experts at Wistar, Columbia University, and the Fox Chase Cancer Center. My training will be guided by clinical and basic cancer researchers who have successfully mentored predoctoral, postdoctoral, and clinical fellows in academic careers. African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality rates of CRC of any ethnic group in the United States. The most common genetic alterations in CRC include K-Ras, Wnt, and TP53. We have pioneered the analysis of naturally occurring coding region variants of p53 in different populations, with emphasis on the impact of these variants on cancer risk and the efficacy of cancer therapy. With this proposal I take aim at two genetic variants in p53 that exist in African American populations, and their impact on CRC progression and therapy. The P47S variant alters p53 phosphorylation and transcriptional function; this variant is impaired for ferroptotic cell death, and knock-in mice containing the P47S variant are susceptible to a variety of tumor types, including CRC. The Y107H variant shows altered structure of the p53 DNA binding domain, and my data indicate that it too has poorer tumor suppressor function and transcriptional potential. I recently used CRISPR engineering to create a mouse model for the Y107H variant. The P47S and Y107H variants together exist in over half a million African Americans in the United States. The goal of the proposed research is to use these naturally-occurring variants as biologically-relevant tools with which to dissect p53 function. I will explore the following scientific aims: 1) to elucidate the mechanisms whereby the P47S variant promotes colorectal cancer development; and 2) to investigate the role of the African-specific Y107H variant in tumor suppression. The completion of the scientific aims in this proposal will develop my research skills and knowledge in both colorectal cancer and the impact of TP53 variants on cancer risk, as well as gaining a more complete understanding of targeted therapies based upon TP53 genotype. I expect this research to have a profound impact on the understanding, and on the eventual successful elimination, of cancer disparities in African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE While there are some indications that socio-economic forces play a role in minority health disparities, there have been over a dozen publications in the past three years that strongly indicate a genetic component to the increased cancer risk and poorer prognosis for African Americans with many cancers, including colorectal cancer. This proposal focuses on two coding region variants in the p53 tumor suppressor gene (Pro47Ser and Tyr107His) that my research shows are “hypomorphs”; I will use genetically engineered mouse models to ascertain the impact of these variants on cancer risk and progression, with a focus on colorectal cancer.",Genetics of Tumor Suppression by p53,9976877,K99CA241367,"['adenoma ', ' Alleles ', '

"Using audio and video brochures in a mail-based FIT outreach intervention PROJECT SUMMARY Our overall goal is to improve the completion of CRC (CRC) screening tests among mid-life adults (50-64 years of age) who reside in Appalachia. CRC screening tests are widely available, however many mid-life adults do not adhere to screening guidelines. Ohio ranks 31st and Kentucky ranks 24th among the United States (U.S.) for CRC screening adherence and CRC screening among Appalachian residents is lower than national standards. This factor likely contributes to the higher CRC incidence and mortality rates in Appalachian Ohio and Appalachian Kentucky compared to rates in the U.S. Because of these CRC disparities, the Appalachian region is included in one of three “hotspots” (spatial clusters of counties with unnecessarily high CRC mortality rates) identified in the U.S. that could benefit from CRC screening interventions. Factors contributing to CRC disparities among Appalachian residents include: lower socioeconomic status and educational attainment; limited health literacy; lifestyle factors; significant co-morbidities; health insurance issues; living in a rural area with inadequate public transportation; less access to healthcare; and lower CRC screening rates. Based on these screening data, lack of public transportation and the distance needed to travel for a colonoscopy in a rural region, and that annual CRC screening with fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is a recommended test option by the United States Preventive Service Task Force and the American Cancer Society, a mailed FIT intervention is a more viable strategy for Appalachian residents. While FIT outreach programs have been shown to increase CRC screening, many adults still do not complete a FIT mailed to their home (up to 70% non-completion in past studies). Common patient barriers to FIT completion include: lack of provider recommendation, perception of low CRC risk; concern about doing the test correctly; messiness with sample collection; concern about test results; forgetfulness; and embarrassment with specimen mailing. Importantly, many of these barriers may be addressed by materials (e.g. FIT instructions) sent with a FIT. However, a limitation of prior FIT outreach interventions has been including materials that are heavy in text and only supplemented with pictures, which may not be appropriate for individuals with limited health literacy. We will develop and pilot test two FIT outreach interventions that address this limitation and overcome other common CRC screening barriers. The interventions will use newer technology, audio or video brochures that include FIT instructions. Audio and video brochures incorporate audio or a video screen (with audio capabilities) surrounded by illustrations, pictures, and text. These brochures offer novel approaches for increasing FIT return by addressing common FIT barriers via targeted CRC screening information and FIT instructions appropriate for all health literacy skills. In addition, we will include disposable gloves in the interventions to address a common screening barrier, the perceived messiness associated with specimen collection. An established interdisciplinary team will use community-engaged research strategies to: Develop two mail- based FIT outreach interventions that use newer technology (audio brochure or video brochure) and disposable gloves in collaboration with Appalachian mid-life adults and healthcare providers (Aim 1); and Conduct a pilot study of the two developed mail-based FIT outreach interventions vs. mailed usual care materials to establish acceptability and obtain preliminary efficacy data on increasing CRC screening (Aim 2). Study findings will inform a future large randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the developed FIT outreach interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates are significantly higher and CRC screening rates are lower among mid-life adults (50-64 years old) living in Appalachian Ohio and Appalachian Kentucky compared to rates of mid-life adults living in the United States. Given that reducing CRC disparities is a public health priority, this proposal will develop and conduct a pilot study of two novel mail-based Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) outreach interventions that include an audio brochure or a video brochure and disposable gloves to increase CRC screening rates among Appalachian mid-life adults at average-risk for CRC.",Using audio and video brochures in a mail-based FIT outreach intervention,9870860,R21AG061496,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' Familial Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' HNPCC ', ' Hereditary Colo-rectal Endometrial Cancer Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Colorectal Endometrial Cancer Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Defective Mismatch Repair Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colo-rectal Neoplasms ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer ', ' LS/HNPCC ', ' Lynch Syndrome ', ' hereditary non-polyposis colo-rectal cancer ', ' hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Kentucky ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' mortality ', ' Ohio ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Booklets ', ' Brochures ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Adenomatous Polyposis Coli ', ' APC -

"Translational Research Program in Colorectal Cancer Disparities Overall Summary/Abstract  Disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality are appreciable and continue to persist in the United States. These disparities are particularly pronounced among the Alaska Native and African American populations. Alaska Native people have among the highest incidence and mortality rates of CRC in the world. The etiology of CRC is multi-dimensional and is influenced by diet, lifestyle factors, medical history, gut microbiome and genetics. However, our understanding of the biological bases for these disparities, particularly as they pertain to mortality, is limited. Three primary gaps in our knowledge are: 1. Our understanding of differences and similarities in the molecular and microbial characteristics of colorectal tumors by race/ethnicity, 2. Our ability to identify patients from different racial/ethnic groups who have elevated risks of CRC mortality and who could benefit from more frequent surveillance and/or additional treatment modalities; and 3. Discovery and validation of novel biological characteristics related to risk of CRC mortality that can serve as potential therapeutic targets. Given the distinct epidemiology and etiologies of CRC across racial/ethnic populations, we hypothesize that important biological differences are present across different races/ethnicities and that these differences will have clinical utility with respect to both distinguishing indolent vs. lethal CRC and informing the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Addressing these gaps could directly reduce persistent CRC disparities.  Our Translational Research Program on Colorectal Cancer Disparities (TRPCD) is specifically developed to address these gaps through new collaborations and leveraging existing clinical and epidemiological data and tumor biospecimens from diverse patient populations. This program will include data and biospecimens from 840 CRC patients with equal numbers coming from Alaska Natives, African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos and non-Hispanic whites. Our two primary goals are: 1. Build the infrastructure needed to support a highly competitive P50 SPORE proposal through the development of an Administrative Core and Biospecimen and Pathology Core; and 2. Advance our capacity to conduct translational cancer disparities research through executing two high-quality Full Projects and establishing a robust Developmental Research Program. Full Project 1 will conduct transcriptomic analyses on the 840 patient tumors to identify novel tumor- tissue based predictors of lethal CRC by race/ethnicity. Full Project 2 will study the gut microbiome in the same 840 patient tumors and assess the impact of the gut microbiome on the tumor microenvironment and CRC mortality overall and by race/ethnicity. Both Projects have the potential to directly impact the gaps described above with respect to identifying clinically actionable racial/ethnic differences, improving the identification of patients at risk of lethal CRC, and discovering novel targets of particular relevance to underserved racial/ethnic populations. Findings will inform interventions that we aim to test in our planned P50 SPORE application. Overall Project Narrative  Alaska Native people and African Americans have increased risks of both developing colorectal cancer and dying from it. However, our current knowledge about what molecular and microbial characteristics contribute to these racial/ethnic differences is very limited. In this first of its kind Program, we will study molecular and microbial differences in colorectal cancer by race/ethnicity and how they contribute to risk of lethal colorectal cancer. Knowledge gained from this research can help to identify patients at high risk of dying from colorectal cancer and discover novel targets to better prevent and treat colorectal cancer that are particularly important for underserved racial/ethnic populations.",Translational Research Program in Colorectal Cancer Disparities,10044047,P20CA252733,"['Bacteria ', ' Biologic Characteristic ', ' Biological Characteristics ', ' Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' Colorectal Tumors ', ' Large Bowel Tumor ', ' Large Intestine Neoplasm ', ' Large Intestine Tumor ', ' colo-rectal neoplasia ', ' colo-rectal neoplasms ', ' colo-rectal tumors ', ' colorectal neoplasia ', ' large bowel neoplasm ', ' Communities ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specimen Handling ', ' Specimen Processing ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Native-Born ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native People ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Indolent ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Medical History ', ' Collaborations ', ' Native Americans ', ' Genetic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Modality ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Clinical Data ', ' life-style factor ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' microbiome ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' transcriptomics ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' therapeutic target ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' patient population ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' colo-rectal cancer patients ', ' colorectal cancer patients ', ' colon cancer patients ', ' tumor cell DNA ', ' tumor-specific DNA ', ' tumor DNA ', ' clinically actionable ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' gut microbiome ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translational research program ', ' colo-rectal cancer risk ', ' colorectal cancer risk ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,P20,2020,1203951,0.2747641102694085
"Adaptive Intervention to Maximize Colorectal Screening in Safety Net Populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening related reductions in incidence and mortality are not benefiting all population subgroups. In clinical settings, repeat attempts at promoting screening are often required over time with the same patients. Few studies have evaluated whether repeated use of interventions in underserved groups can produce greater screening. Multi 'dose' interventions may be necessary to elevate screening rates to levels seen with breast and cervical cancer screening. This study will utilize a Bayesian adaptive design to study CRC screening in a highly diverse, safety-net clinic population. Although a growing number of studies have found implementation intentions-based interventions effective, no studies have tested such techniques twice in sequence to enhance CRC screening uptake. CRC screening implementation intentions address the ""when,"" ""where"" and ""how"" details of stool sample or colonoscopy screening. A randomized design will test a comparison condition of generic health education (HE) versus implementation intentions (I2), and, for participants who do not complete screening within six months, will re-randomize to one of these two strategies again. All intervention materials will be delivered via low-cost touch screen computers and tablets customized for use in English, Spanish, Nepali, Burmese, and Arabic for Somalis (to accommodate safety-net refugee clients). Pilot testing and formative phase focus groups will test the salience and appropriateness of touch screen audio, video, and graphic materials for each of these groups (except Nepali, where materials were recently developed and pilot tested). The study will be conducted with 500 patients eligible for CRC screening in a group of 9 safety- net primary care clinics. All participants will complete a touch screen administered screening form, informed consent, a baseline survey, and receive information on test options. Because of the rapidly changing insurance landscape for the underserved, we will not cover test costs beyond coverage already in place or obtained for each participant. Participants who complete screening within 6 months will only receive HE or I2 once. Those who do not screen will receive a second intervention dose and re-assessment of insurance status to test varied combination effects of HE +HE, HE + I2, I2 + I2, or I2 + HE on CRC screening completion. Changes or variations in health coverage will be analyzed as a co-variate. Six and 12-month phone surveys will be completed with all participants. The primary outcome will be CRC screening completion at 12 months. Secondary outcomes will come from a mediation analysis of the main outcome and co-variates. We will conduct a cost analysis of the intervention and its variable components. This study will provide important information on the utility and feasibility of embedding low-cost, implementation intentions-based interventions in ""real-world"" primary care, where they may be cost effective for repeated application over time with difficult to promote behaviors such as CRC screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although Colorectal Cancer (CRC) screening is now used by more of the age eligible population than in prior decades, many low-income and uninsured individuals remain unscreened. This project will test an adaptive and sequential intervention approach to maximize rates of screening among a safety-net clinic population suffering from high rates of CRC disparities. It will target a diverse sample of patients including low-income African Americans, Latinos, refugees, and Whites. We will use a Bayesian adaptive design to test the impact of one or two doses of an ""implementation intentions"" informed behavioral intervention versus generic health education on CRC screening. Study outcomes will be measured from fecal immunochemical test or colonoscopy reports from the study testing center.",Adaptive Intervention to Maximize Colorectal Screening in Safety Net Populations,9898331,R01CA188898,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Belief ', ' Client ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Computers ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' assess cost ', ' cost assessment ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Incidence ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Insurance ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Privatization ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tablets ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Uninsured ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Health Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Baseline Surveys ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' colorectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' touch panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' safety net ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Burmese ', ' program costs ', ' intervention cost ', ' breast and cervical cancer screening ', ' stool specimen ', ' stool sample ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial ', ' cost estimation ', ' cost estimate ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,864738,0.2827865174684771
"Colonic responses to vitamin D and aspirin in African- and European-Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  African Americans (AA) have the greatest burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the US, and biological reasons for this disparity remain incompletely understood. Interactions between host and environmental factors, including chemopreventive treatments, are known to modify CRC risk, and there is emerging evidence of differences in treatment effects between AA and European Americans (EA) for the two most promising chemopreventive agents, vitamin D and aspirin. Our broad objective is to model and understand how inter- ethnic differences in treatment responses could contribute to CRC disparities. Our laboratory has optimized stem cell-derived human organoid cultures to study cellular responses between individuals that have not been feasible using traditional models. In this proposal, we use colonic organoids to test the central hypothesis that transcriptional, chromatin accessibility and cellular responses to vitamin D and/or aspirin differ between AA and EA, and that these inter-ethnic differences could impact CRC risk and clinical treatment response.  We previously treated ex vivo primary colon tissue from AA and EA with active vitamin D (1,25D) and identified several genes with inter-ethnic response differences. The success of finding genes with inter-ethnic response differences provides rationale for extending our genome-wide approach to 1,25D, aspirin and combination treatments in a larger sample size of colonic organoids (80 AA & 80 EA) to achieve greater power to identify inter-ethnic differences in transcriptional networks as well as chromatin accessibility. We will replicate observed differences in an independent cohort of organoids as well as test for cancer-relevant cellular treatment phenotypes in a subset of treated organoids (50 AA & 50 EA) (Aim 1). Further, using RNA-seq data obtained in Aim 1, we will test for a genetic contribution to response differences between individuals and ethnicities using allele specific expression. The response genes and SNPs identified will be tested for enrichment among genes and SNPs from NIH-funded CRC GWAS and chemoprevention trials as well as tested mechanistically using functional assays (Aim 2).  The outcomes of our innovative study will: i) elucidate underlying biology and genetic architecture of responses to vitamin D and aspirin in the colon and how they differ by ethnicity, ii) connect cellular response with CRC risk and response to chemoprevention, and iii) identify genes and SNPs for mechanistic studies as well as for possible development as novel biomarkers for personalized CRC prevention in order to, ultimately, reduce CRC disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Environmental factors, including responses to treatments, play important roles in cancer risk in the colon. By studying how individuals respond to environmental factors, such as treatment with vitamin D and aspirin, we will learn about how cancer can be prevented, and it will be possible to predict who is most likely to benefit from these preventative interventions. This is especially important in African Americans who have the highest rates of colon cancer and are most likely to die from this preventable disease.",Colonic responses to vitamin D and aspirin in African- and European-Americans,9955211,R01CA220329,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Aspirin ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Attention ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chromatin ', ' Colon ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Maps ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Organoids ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Experimental Models ', ' δ opioid receptors ', ' δ-OR ', ' δOR ', ' delta opioid receptor ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' CRC prevention ', ' colo-rectal cancer prevention ', ' prevent colo-rectal cancer ', ' prevent colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' Chemoprevention ', ' Host Factor ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' cell assay ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' Chemopreventive ', ' anti-carcinogenic ', ' anticarcinogenic ', ' chemoprevention agent ', ' Chemopreventive Agent ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' treatment effect ', ' high risk ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' ATACseq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' targeted agent ', ' Risk stratification ', ' colo-rectal cancer risk ', ' colorectal cancer risk ', ' genetic architecture ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,386649,0.09775891271533022
"Understanding Ethnic Differences in Cancer: The Multiethnic Cohort Study Global Cancer Health Disparities Supplement to U01 CA164973  “Understanding Ethnic Differences in Cancer: The Multiethnic Cohort Study”  Principal Investigator: Loïc Le Marchand, MD, PhD Title: Understanding the high colorectal cancer risk of Japanese Americans: A MEC-JPHC comparison Abstract: This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA- 20-032. The purpose of this supplement is to better understand the very high risk of Japanese Americans for colorectal cancer by comparing risk factors and cancer-related biomarkers between two populations with substantially different risks: Japanese Americans participating in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) and Japanese participants in the Japan Public Health Center-Based Prospective Study (JPHC) Cohort. These two cohorts conducted on genetically similar populations, have very comparable community-based designs, questionnaires, biospecimen collection protocols and time course. Therefore, they provide a unique opportunity to better understand similarities and differences in incidence trends and risk factors for cancer in these two populations. In Aim 1, we propose to validate a blood biomarker-based score for visceral adipose tissue (VAT), originally developed in MEC, among 140 healthy Tokyo middle-aged adults with VAT measurement available. This score was associated with colorectal cancer in Japanese Americans in MEC, independently of BMI and other risk factors, suggesting that VAT, a type of fat disproportionally abundant in Japanese Americans, may play an important role in explaining their high risk for the disease. In contrast, obesity has remained rare in Japan. In Aim 2, we propose to formally compare risk factors for colorectal cancer in Japanese between MEC (N=2,092 cases) and JPHC (N=2,600 cases). We will focus on risk factors particularly relevant to Japanese Americans, such as VAT and VAT-related nutritional components, and investigate whether they explain differences in incidence of colorectal cancer between the two cohorts. These risk factors include: for prospective analyses: diet quality (Healthy Eating Index-2015, Japanese Diet Index), intakes of dietary components (e.g., sugars, fat, dietary fiber, red meat, well-done meat, alcohol), physical activity, BMI, and smoking, and for nested case-control studies (381 cases / 381 controls in MEC; 375 cases / controls in JPHC): the VAT biomarker score and cancer-related biomarkers (IGF-I, IGFBP3, insulin, HOMA-IR, leptin, adiponectin, SHBG). The similarity of genetic ancestry will be confirmed based on available GWAS data. By contributing very similar data from an outside comparison population, this supplement will further the parent U01 CA164973 grant’s aim to better understand reasons for ethnic/racial disparities in cancer by focusing on Japanese Americans, a rarely-studied population. This supplement application, submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT- CA-20-032, focuses on understanding the very high risk of Japanese Americans for colorectal cancer by comparing risk factors and cancer-related biomarkers between two populations: Japanese Americans participating in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) and Japanese participants in the

"Role of Circadian Factors in Inflammation and Colorectal Adenoma Risk Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common and deadly forms of cancer. In South Carolina, our group has documented racial CRC disparities that exceed national rates. Most colon tumors arise from adenomas (adenomatous polyps) that are detected via a screening colonoscopy. Gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation and aberrant DNA methylation are key processes driving adenoma formation and CRC risk. Sleep loss and circadian rhythm disruption can induce inflammation, alter DNA methylation, and increase CRC risk. African- Americans (AAs) differ from European-Americans (EAs) in their endogenous circadian timing, and they are more likely than EAs to have poor sleep and excessive stress (allostatic overload or ‘weathering’). This case- control study will test the hypothesis that disruption of circadian processes and sleep is associated with inflammation and adenoma risk among AA and EA patients receiving a screening colonoscopy. Molecular timekeeping is controlled by ‘clock genes’ that regulate circadian gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms. Clock genes can modulate inflammation (e.g., TNFα, IL-6 expression), and they act as tumor suppressors (e.g., the ‘Period’ or PER genes). Our research suggests that genetic variation or aberrant methylation in PER genes is associated with increased adenoma risk, and that sleep disorders can increase CRC risk. Melatonin is a clock-regulated hormone that suppresses GI inflammation and inhibits colon tumor growth by binding to its cellular receptors (MT-1, RORα). This study will characterize biobehavioral circadian disruption indicators (sleep disturbances, social jet lag, fatigue, stress), along with key molecular correlates (PER3 genotype and methylation of: clock genes [PER1, PER2, PER3]; clock-controlled genes [MT-1, RORα, TNFα, IL-6]; and global DNA methylation [LINE-1]) to determine their role in inflammation and adenoma risk. A biobehavioral framework will address the following Specific Aims: 1) Conduct a case-control study among patients undergoing a screening colonoscopy to determine whether circadian disruption indicators (DNA methylation, biobehavioral, genetic) are associated with adenoma case status relative to controls, and if the relationship is modified by race (N=1,000; 400 cases, 600 controls); 2) Determine if circadian disruption indicators are associated with inflammation in normal GI tissue (TNFα, IL-6 mRNA expression); 3) Determine whether behavioral and molecular circadian disruption indicators are related; 4) Among adenoma cases, determine if methylation of candidate circadian genes in adenomas differs from normal GI tissue. Our team has a strong track record of providing high quality colonoscopy services and in engaging AA and EA communities in research. Prospective data collection (relative to colonoscopy) and the use of valid, quantitative biobehavioral and molecular measures will limit the potential introduction of bias. This study will rigorously examine circadian-based behavioral and molecular risk factors as they relate to GI inflammation and colorectal adenoma risk. Circadian-based risk factors may serve as novel, modifiable targets for CRC prevention. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common and deadly forms of cancer, and the racial CRC disparity in South Carolina exceeds the national average. This study will use a biobehavioral case-control design to determine whether the disruption of circadian rhythms and sleep, including their genetic and epigenetic (DNA methylation) correlates, is associated with inflammation or colorectal adenomas among African- and European- American patients receiving a screening colonoscopy. Our study will rigorously evaluate whether circadian- based factors may serve as novel, modifiable targets for CRC prevention.",Role of Circadian Factors in Inflammation and Colorectal Adenoma

"Transdisciplinary Team Science in Colorectal Cancer Prognosis: the ColoCare Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer will affect one in 20 individuals over the course of their lifetime. The ColoCare Study is a prospective cohort of men and women newly diagnosed with a first primary invasive colorectal cancer (stage I-IV) with repeat data and biospecimen collection beginning prior to surgery. The ColoCare Study was initiated at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center with subsequent consortium sites at the Moffitt Cancer Center, the German Cancer Research Center, and Huntsman Cancer Institute with institutional pilot/start-up funding to support patient recruitment. The goal of this study is to uniformly collet comprehensive sets of data and biospecimens from over 4000 multiethnic colorectal cancer patients at multiple time points (prior to surgery and 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post-surgery), including detailed treatment and risk factor data, fresh and fixed tumor and normal tissue, visceral adipose tissue, blood, stool, urine, saliva, and quantitative accelerometry data t assess physical activity. Each ColoCare Study site leverages existing infrastructure, including access to electronic medical records and NCI comprehensive/designated cancer center cores, while utilizing well-established protocols for recruitment, data collection, and biospecimen ascertainment that are consistently applied across all sites. Patients are followed up both actively and passively by study staff (in-person and through medical record reviews), as well as via linkages to cancer registry and vital status records. Currently, using pilot/institutional fund at four existing sites, we have recruited >1100 patients (n=1010 baseline bloods). With this infrastructure grant, we propose 1) to extend the ColoCare consortium to two new study centers that will enrich our numbers of underrepresented minority participants (University of Southern California, LA, and Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis) and 2) to continue and expand study procedures at all US sites, including energy balance assessments and molecular characterization of tumors. The support for expanded enrollment and continued follow-up of the ColoCare cohort will result in an estimated 4167 highly characterized enrollees. The repeat sampling of data and a diverse set of accompanying biospecimens at critical time points enables unprecedented epidemiologic and biomarker research that can inform clinical decision making and support evidence-based guidelines regarding lifestyle changes that impact outcomes. Additionally, we will establish an external advisory board and a community/participant advisory board to further guide infrastructure development and prioritize research use of this cohort. We will continue to participate in national and international consorti by contributing data and biospecimens. Support for this unique cohort of colorectal cancer patients will create a valuable resource for the broader research community. In-depth, repeated phenotyping within a single cohort will enable one-of-a-kind studies focused on the effects of health behaviors on prognosis, as well as the discovery of new biomarkers of clinically important outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    We propose to continue building and expanding the ColoCare Study, the only existing cohort of colorectal cancer patients for whom clinical data, information on health behaviors, and universal biospecimens have been systematically collected at repeat time points; ColoCare is uniquely suited for the discovery of new biomarkers of colorectal cancer treatment response and prognosis, as well as research that elucidates the influence of health behaviors on treatment efficacy and toxicity, quality-of-life, recurrence, and survival. We propose here to continue and augment collections at existing ColoCare sites, expand to two new sites that will focus on the recruitment of ethnic/racial minorities (over 4000 participants), and perform molecular characterization of tumor samples. This unique, multiethnic cohort will be an incredible resource for the broader research community, given its suitability for a wide-range of studies with potentially significant and near-term clinical

"Effectiveness and Implementation of mPATH-CRC:  a Mobile Health System for Colorectal Cancer Screening Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Screening for CRC reduces mortality and is widely recommended for all adults starting at age 50, yet over 35% of Americans remain unscreened. To address the multiple barriers to CRC screening (patient, clinician, and system), our team developed mPATH-CRC (mobile PAtient Technology for Health-Colorectal Cancer), a patient-friendly iPad program used by individuals immediately before a routine primary care visit. mPATH-CRC is a CRC screening decision aid that helps patients make a screening decision, allows patients to “self-order” a CRC screening test, and minimizes provider and system barriers. After the visit, mPATH-CRC automatically sends patients who choose to be screened supportive text messages at key times to help them complete their chosen test. In our recently completed randomized controlled trial of 450 diverse patients (R01CA178941), mPATH- CRC doubled the proportion of patients who completed CRC screening. To fully realize mPATH-CRC's potential to decrease CRC mortality, the program now must be implemented in primary care practices in a way that encourages routine and sustained use. However, while hundreds of mobile health (mHealth) tools have been developed in recent years, the optimal strategies for implementing and maintaining mHealth interventions in clinical practice are unknown. We have developed a “high touch” mHealth implementation strategy based on our prior research and guided by the Technology Acceptance Model and the Dynamic Sustainability Framework. Our strategy leverages evidence-based elements including clinic champions, facilitation, regular data feedback, follow-up training, and adaptation. Our team now proposes to compare the results of the “high touch” strategy to a “low touch” strategy using a Type III hybrid study design and incorporating mixed methods to evaluate implementation, maintenance, and effectiveness of mPATH-CRC in a diverse sample of community-based practices. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to: 1) in a cluster-randomized controlled trial of 28 primary care clinics, compare the implementation outcomes of a “high touch” evidence-based mHealth implementation strategy with a “low touch” implementation strategy; 2) in a nested pre-post study, estimate the effect of mPATH-CRC on completion of CRC screening within 16 weeks of visit; and 3) determine the factors that facilitate or impede the maintenance of mHealth interventions like mPATH-CRC by surveying and interviewing clinic staff and providers as part of a mixed-methods analysis. This project could decrease CRC morbidity and mortality by translating our evidence-based CRC-screening intervention into community practice, directly addressing the goals of Healthy People 2020 and the National Cancer Moonshot. Importantly, completion of these aims will yield essential information for successful implementation of other technology- mediated interventions in primary care settings, addressing a current gap in knowledge. mPATH-CRC is an innovative iPad app that patients use before a primary care medical visit to help them receive colorectal cancer screening, a widely recommended test that decreases mortality. However, while hundreds of health apps have been developed in recent years, the best strategies for incorporating apps in routine primary care remain unknown. This project will determine the optimal way to implement mPATH-CRC and other technology-based programs in community-based primary care practices, increasing the use of life- saving screening tests and improving the delivery of medical care.",Effectiveness and Implementation of mPATH-CRC:  a Mobile Health System for Colorectal Cancer Screening,9895633,R01CA218416,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Savings ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' suburban ', ' suburbia ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Community Practice ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' dissemination trial ', ' implementation trial ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' community based practice ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' primary care setting ', ' secondary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' secondary analysis ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' implementation strategy ', ' cost estimation ', ' cost estimate ', ' ']",NCI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,522602,0.2758657905103999
"A patient-centered intervention using virtual technology to reduce colorectal cancer disparities in primary care PROJECT ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Unfortunately, there are significant CRC screening disparities that result in higher rates of CRC-related morbidity and mortality for minority and rural patient populations, particularly in the southern United States. The development of interventions that capitalize on advances in communication, informatics, and computer science have great promise for resolving theoretical and practical problems associated with CRC screening decision-making. The purpose of this proposal is to test the efficacy of a patient-centered, tailored message intervention delivered via virtual technology for increasing CRC screening within guidelines among racial/ethnic minority and rural patients. We hypothesize that exposure to a minimally tailored CRC screening intervention delivered via VHT will lead to improved cognitive processing of the intervention and increased adherence with initial and repeated annual FIT screening completion as compared to a fully tailored, text-only intervention. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct focus groups and think-aloud interviews stratified by geography, gender, and racial/ethnic background to expand and pilot test an intervention that uses a virtual human as a delivery mechanism for CRC screening information. In Specific Aim 2, patients (N = 3,000) will be recruited via primary care clinics and a secure, clinical data warehouse to complete a patient- randomized test of the efficacy of the intervention for promoting initial and repeat FIT testing. Dependent measures will be assessed via patient self-report and chart review. The proposed study will reduce health disparities and associated morbidity and mortality due to CRC via increasing screening among racial/ethnic minority and rural populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE A primary goal of Healthy People 2020 is to increase the percentage of individuals screened for colorectal cancer (CRC) across population subgroups to 80%. The proposed study will reduce health disparities and associated morbidity and mortality due to CRC by increasing FIT screening among racial/ethnic minorities and rural patients through a novel, culturally sensitive intervention.",A patient-centered intervention using virtual technology to reduce colorectal cancer disparities in primary care,9859351,R01CA207689,"['Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Rural Population ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Individual ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' uptake ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Published Comment ', ' Exposure to ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' computer science ', ' Informatics ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Appearance ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient registry ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' cost ', ' virtual human ', ' Minority ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' web-enabled ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' tailored messaging ', ' usability ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' prototype ', ' patient population ', ' efficacy testing ', ' clinical data repository ', ' clinical data warehouse ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' precision screening ', ' personalized screening ', ' rural patients ', ' recruit ', ' patient barriers ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' patient engagement ', ' screening disparities ', ' Infrastructure ', ' virtual technology ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' screening guidelines ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2020,740301,0.3155099810058364
"Optimizing Colorectal Cancer Screening PREcision and Outcomes in CommunIty-baSEd Populations (PRECISE) Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Most deaths are preventable through early detection, but failures of screening completion and quality substantially impair test effectiveness. This proposal unites the productive PROSPR I CRC Centers into a single collaboration to address key questions and pilot interventions to improve CRC screening outcomes. In PROSPR I, we developed a strong transdisciplinary, multisite collaboration. We collected 316 data elements, performed validation studies, created high-quality pooled data sets to identify patient, provider, and system gaps in the CRC screening process factors and published >60 manuscripts. Our unified PROSPR II Research Center (PRC) will use these proven collaborations and >10 years of longitudinal data for >8.9 million screen-eligible people (~ 1 of 40 eligible people in the US), large numbers of screening exposures (>8.4 million fecal immunochemical tests [FIT] and >1.9 million colonoscopies), and outcomes (>28,000 CRCs). Our PRC is geographically, demographically and economically diverse (three states, >800,000 African Americans, 1.6 million Hispanics, and 1 million Asian Americans). The health systems have different CRC screening patterns, different modalities, and include all major insurance/reimbursement methods (safety net, Medicare, Medicaid, high-deductible and pre-paid/fee-for-service, staff-model and incentivized providers).  Our PROSPR I research identified major deficiencies in three areas of CRC screening: who should get screening and surveillance and when; why people do not complete recommended screening, surveillance or follow-up of positive tests; and how test quality and accuracy can be improved. Project 1 will identify on whom and when screening should be performed, particularly for those with conflicting recommendations (e.g., African Americans aged 40-49 years, and patients 76-85 years old). Project 2 will evaluate when surveillance should occur after a precancerous polyp diagnosis, using baseline colonoscopy results and precise new 10-year risk estimates for CRC. Project 3 will explore long-term screening patterns and multilevel drivers of why screening and surveillance are not appropriately completed, especially in understudied patients who never screen, fail to re-screen, use surveillance inappropriately or fail to follow up after a positive screening test. Project 4 will evaluate how to increase the effectiveness of FIT and colonoscopy by optimizing age- and sex-stratified quantitative FIT abnormal ranges, establishing precise adenoma detection thresholds for quality improvement and evaluating drivers of adenoma detection. We will use results from these observational studies, behavioral science methods, and stakeholder involvement to develop and pilot test multilevel interventions. Our transdisciplinary team of scientists, physicians, and healthcare experts will also provide leadership and data for trans-PROSPR, multiple-organ collaborations. The proposed research can substantially decrease the burden of CRC by reducing disparities and identifying ways to improve screening completion and effectiveness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Screening can reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in clinical trials. However, the real practice of screening in different community based populations differs from what can be achieved in trials. Optimizing screening strategies by characterizing potential failures of the screening process, improving the accuracy of screening tests, developing screening strategies tailored to personal risk and identifying ways to help more people complete screening offers substantial potential for decreasing colorectal cancer deaths.",Optimizing Colorectal Cancer Screening PREcision and Outcomes in CommunIty-baSEd Populations (PRECISE),9906181,UM1CA222035,"['adenoma ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Consultations ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Deductibles ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Incentives ', ' Incidence ', ' Insurance ', ' Leadership ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Polyps ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' 85+ years old ', ' age 85 and greater ', ' age 85 and older ', ' aged 85 and greater ', ' aged 85 and older ', ' human very old age (85+) ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' PLYPCMY ', ' Polypectomy ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' colorectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Manuscripts ', ' validation studies ', ' Modality ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Precancerous Polyp ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Detection ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', ' safety net ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer patients ', ' colorectal cancer patients ', ' colon cancer patients ', ' precision screening ', ' personalized screening ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' colo-rectal cancer risk ', ' colorectal cancer risk ', ' preventable mortality ', ' preventable death ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' screening guidelines ', ' Data Pooling ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,UM1,2020,3888271,0.26455630864600027
"Using Context to Improve Implementation of Evidenced-based Interventions for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Rural Primary Care (Precise CRC) PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Melinda Davis has a PhD in social developmental psychology and is a Research Assistant Professor in the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) School of Medicine (Department of Family Medicine) and Assistant Professor in the OHSU-PSU School of Public Health (Health Behavior). She is the Director of Community Engaged Research for the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN) at OHSU. This K07 builds upon her applied experience as a practice facilitator and participatory researcher, addresses critical gaps in scientific training, and provides pilot data for an R01 submission in year 3 in response to PAR-16-238. Guided by a multidisciplinary team of mentors, Dr. Davis will, through this K07, consolidate her skills in implementation science, mixed-methods, and cancer prevention and control. She will also secure her transition to research independence. Research Focus: Bridging the gap between knowledge of evidence based interventions (EBIs) and application in “real world” settings is a critical issue in cancer prevention and control research. Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, yet disparities exist for rural and low-income populations. Although direct mail (DM) programs can increase CRC screening rates by nearly 40%, this EBI is not yet routine practice. Moreover, implementation and intervention outcomes vary widely across settings. Research is needed to inform how best to scale DM programs and to support follow-up colonoscopy on positive fecal tests. Guided by the social ecological model and consolidated framework for implementation research we propose three aims:  Aim 1: Identify factors associated with higher levels of primary care practice readiness to implement direct  mail programs to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.  H1: Leadership culture and higher levels of adaptive reserve will be associated with readiness.  Aim 2: Pilot test tailored implementation support for a direct mail program in four rural primary care  practices clustered in one Medicaid Accountable Care Organization (ACO).  Aim 3: Elucidate barriers, facilitators, and adaptations to direct mail program components and the  associated impact on implementation and intervention outcomes. Training Goals: The training proposed fills critical gaps to enable Dr. Davis to conduct trials to improve the identification, adaptation, and implementation of EBIs to improve cancer prevention in rural primary care. The mentoring, training, and research aims ensure scientific growth in three areas: (1) Knowledge of advanced implementation science research methods; (2) Mixed methods research design and analysis; and (3) Leading multidisciplinary teams in cancer prevention and control. Environment: The OHSU Department of Family Medicine provides institutional support for this K07. Research and training activities also utilize the robust infrastructure of the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute (OCTRI), Knight Cancer Institute, and the Kaiser Permanente Northwest Center for Health Research. Methods: We will use an intervention mixed method design with embedded convergent and sequential components. To achieve Aim 1, we will conduct a multimodal (email, phone, in-person) survey of ORPRN practices (N~190), which are spread across Oregon's 16 Medicaid ACOs. We use generalized linear mixed models to identify factors associated with higher levels of readiness. To achieve Aim 2, we will use practice facilitation informed by the Getting to Outcomes™ approach, an evidence-based model that uses 10 steps to help organizations implement EBIs, to implement DM programs into four rural primary care clinics clustered in one Medicaid ACO (PacificSource Health Plans). We will assess the number of eligible patients reached (implementation outcomes) and the impact on CRC screening (intervention outcomes) and use a merging approach to cross-tabulate findings from clinic performance data with qualitative themes from observation visits and a baseline assessments of adaptive reserve and practice-readiness. In Aim 3, we will interview key informants from each practice (N~20) to identify DM program adaptations and elucidate barriers and facilitators to implementation. Outcomes: The training and research activities in this K07 fill critical gaps in scientific training for Dr. Davis. Findings provide essential pilot data on practice readiness, implementation strategies, and intervention adaptations which will inform an R01 submission in year 3 in response to PAR-16-238 to scale DM programs across rural clinics served by Oregon's Medicaid ACOs in a two arm pragmatic clinical trial. Findings address NCI agency priorities to implement EBIs and study multilevel interventions, help address long-standing CRC screening disparities, and propel Dr. Davis to research independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Colorectal cancer screening saves lives, yet over 40% of eligible adults have not been tested. This K07 explores the impact of multilevel interventions to improve colorectal cancer screening and treatment in rural and underserved patients and is designed to facilitate Dr. Davis' transition to research independence.

"Adapting and Implementing a Remote, Digital CRC Screening Intervention for Primary Care Practice in Response to COVID-19 PROJECT SUMMARY Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), the overall goal of this proposed supplement is to adapt the Meet ALEX intervention to patient concerns about CRC screening safety as a result of COVID-19, pilot test in 2 new primary care clinics, and examine implementation of a remote intervention in a post-pandemic clinical environment. The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to exacerbate cancer screening inequities among vulnerable patient populations. Through the parent grant, the research team has worked in 6 UF Gainesville clinics to develop an efficient workflow and support infrastructure to address the CRC screening needs of vulnerable patient populations. Stool-based testing is now being recommended to reduce the forthcoming backlog of endoscopic and radiological CRC screening exams. The Meet ALEX intervention is ideally situated to help mitigate CRC screening inequities for vulnerable patient populations by providing patient education and in-home stool testing. In Specific Aim 1, we will expand implementation of the parent grant intervention, called Meet ALEX (Agent Leveraging Empathy for Exams) to 2 UF Jacksonville clinics that serve a predominantly Black/African American and Latinx patient population. We will also pilot test a modification that addresses patient concerns about CRC screening safety related to COVID-19. We will examine whether tailoring the intervention to patient concerns about COVID-19 alters self-reported preferences for CRC screening modality (ie, colonoscopy, home stool testing) and behavior (assessed via chart review) compared with patients who receive the existing intervention. In Specific Aim 2, we will describe facilitators and barriers associated with implementing Meet ALEX as a result of COVID-19 through in-depth interviews with key stakeholders (ie, health care providers and clinic managers) from all implementing clinics (N=8) to understand changes to organizational processes and preferences for CRC screening, availability of remote counseling, and barriers and facilitators related to implementing digital interventions as a result of the pandemic. The results of this supplement will lead to the development of best practices for implementing digital cancer screening interventions to reduce CRC inequities in primary care settings affected by COVID-19. PROJECT NARRATIVE The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to exacerbate colorectal cancer screening inequities among vulnerable patient populations. This supplement will adapt and expand dissemination of the Meet ALEX colorectal screening intervention to 2 clinics with a primarily Black/African American and Latinx patient population. It will also contribute to understanding best practices for implementing remote patient interventions in a post- pandemic clinical environment.","Adapting and Implementing a Remote, Digital CRC Screening Intervention for Primary Care Practice in Response to COVID-19",10203003,R01CA207689,"['Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Counseling ', ' Empathy ', ' Environment ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Interview ', ' male ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Rural ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Exposure to ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' colorectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' implementation research ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' aged ', ' parent grant ', ' patient population ', ' primary care setting ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' screening ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' ethnic identity ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' screening guidelines ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2020,152492,0.2378257445080604
