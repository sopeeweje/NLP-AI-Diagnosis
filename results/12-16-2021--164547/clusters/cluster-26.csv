"UNDERSTANDING RACE DIFFERENCES IN LONG-TERM CARE The provision of long-term care to disabled older people continues to be a major focus of policy and research in the financing and delivery of health care.  Previous research has documented the gaps in financing long-term care services for older people, the heavy reliance on family members as providers of care, and the strong desire of disabled older people to remain community-resident even though resources for community-based formal long-term care services are often meager and fragmented.  One aspect of the long-term care ""problem"" that has received little attention, however, is the role of race or minority-group membership.  The overall objective of the proposed research is to investigate the role of race in the structure of informal caregiving arrangements and the use of formal inhome care and nursing home care.  The data are from the National Long-Term Care Surveys, a nationally representative survey of disabled people age 65 or older.  In order to characterize the provision of long-term care to black disabled elders, in contrast to their white counter parts, the project will be guided by the following specific aims: 1. To describe and compare the structure of informal care arrangements of black and white disabled elders. 2. To examine the effects of psychosocial, contextual, economic factors and the structure of informal care arrangements, on black/white differences in long-term care utilization. 3. To investigate differences by race in the caregiver role and in perceptions of caregiving, and the effects on use of formal long-term care services.  The goal of the proposed research is to advance our understanding of the significance of race in the provision of long-term care.  It is particularly important, of course, to determine the extent to which differences by race reflect barriers to access as opposed to preferences that are more closely tied to cultural differences.  By focusing on policy-related variables, such as economic resources and contextual indicators of the health services environment, as well as informal care arrangements and psychosocial factors, it is possible to begin to understand the causes of race differences in use of formal long-term care services.  Equally important, such analyses will clarify the need for policy interventions to address racial inequities.

"MIAMI CENTER ON HUMAN FACTORS AND AGING RESEARCH It is well established that a pressing issue for the upcoming decades is ensuring that the large population of Older Americans, is able to function independently and maintain an acceptable quality of life.  The urgency of this concern stems from the knowledge that the population of elderly is increasing and large numbers of older adults have difficulty completing life activities. In response to the need to develop infrastructures which are supportive of older adults, the University of Miami is proposing to establish a Center on Human Factors Engineering and Aging Research. The Center will encompass an integrated program of Human Factors and aging research, a plan for field intervention studies to evaluate the outcomes of the research, and a program to disseminate the information gained by the Center to government, community and corporate agencies and older adults. The overall goal of the Center is to develop strategies to enhance the quality of life and productivity of aging persons.  The conceptual framework for the research program will be based on a human factors approach to person-environment transactions which involves identifying disparities between environment/task demands and the functional capabilities of older adult populations.  The focus of the research project will be on practical problems encountered by older people in various arenas such as transportation, home and work. Specifically, the Center proposes three initial research projects, which will result in interventions such as a home safety training program, housing design guidelines, older driver training, and software and job design guidelines to be field tested.  Outcome measures will include improvement in the performance of everyday activities, improvement in cognitive skills, reduced potential for accidents and injury and thus improved ability to live independently.  The Center will have multiple performance sites and strong links to industry, government and community agencies as well as plans to organize workshops and other programs to disseminate the Center's information. The proposed Center is unique in terms of its emphasis on Human Factors Engineering, multidisciplinary team, and study populations which draw on the multitude of elderly persons and rich ethnic diversity of South Florida.

"LITERACY AND HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION IN OLDER BLACKS Demographic and health status data have consistently shown older blacks to be at a disadvantage relative to older whites. Investigations into nonphysiological factors have implicated education as a major cause of these disparities. Optimum health care is contingent upon the ability to comprehend written and oral instructions, yet most investigators have limited the analysis of educational influences to terms of highest grade level completed. Thus, the independent effects of variations in literacy skills have not been adequately addressed in health-related research. Low levels of literacy may lead to insufficient knowledge of available services, noncompliance with recommended treatment protocols, and failure to seek care when needed, all of which may adversely affect health status. Proposed is a cross-sectional study to examine the associations between reading ability and health services utilization in blacks aged 65 years and older living in a defined area. We seek to enroll 224 participants in the study. The primary hypotheses to be tested are: 1) there is no difference in health services utilization between illiterate and literate individuals. 2) There is no relationship between reading ability and physical health status. 3) Level of formal education is a reliable indicator of reading ability. Subjects will be identified from a Federal Medicaid/Medicare data tape for the county of interest. Personal interviews will be conducted and data collected on demographic, socioeconomic, health status, utilization, health beliefs, and locus of control variables. Medical records will be reviewed to supplement existing data and to obtain additional information regarding health status and patterns of utilization. The word recognition subtest from the Wide Range Achievement Tests-Revised (WRAT-R) will be used to measure reading levels. To obtain an assessment of comprehension skills, all participants will be asked to listen to two passages taken in context from health education material prepared by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. A series of three short questions will follow each passage. One of the most common myths about illiterates is that they are also unintelligent. By virtue of the same argument used to assert that levels of formal education should not be equated with reading ability, one must be cautious in assuming that illiteracy coincides with low intelligence. Thus, distinguishing between reading ability and I.Q. is crucial to this research. To accomplish this objective, matrices from the nonverbal Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT) will be administered and standard scores used in the analytical procedures. The high prevalence of many chronic diseases in older blacks evidences the need for extensive research of this type within this population. Taking into consideration the strong intergenerational patterns accompanying educational attainment, results of this study should facilitate efforts to improve the overall quality of health for all African Americans.

"AGEISM, RACISM, AND HEALTH OF OLDER AFRICAN AMERICANS Older African Americans are more likely to develop serious illness, suffer greater disability, and have increased mortality compared with their Caucasian peers. For example, the age-adjusted rate of hypertension in African Americans is more than 50% greater than the rate of Caucasian Americans and the associated morbidity and mortality is even higher. Despite a growing body of research aimed at identifying the mechanisms that contribute to the racial disparity in the health status of older African Americans, the reason(s) for the decreased health status in the minority population are not fully understood. Recent preliminary results raise the possibility that ageism more specifically, how older persons perceive ""older persons""-- contributes to the increased blood pressure and decreased functional status in the elderly in general, and perhaps, also among older African Americans. In older Caucasian men and women, self serotypes of aging affect walking and memory in addition to the cardiovascular response to stress. Moreover, subconscious reinforcement of positive serotypes of aging apparently improves memory and walking performance and reduces the cardiovascular response to stress. These findings suggest that enhancing the stereotype of aging and race and the self-perception of older African Americans may also enhance the performance of activities of daily living and the maintenance of independence in this minority population. Therefore, we propose: 1) To test the hypothesis that older African Americans exposed to an intervention designed to activate a positive imaging of aging will demonstrate a significantly lower cardiovascular response to stress, improved cognitive function and enhance physical performance compared to older African Americans who are exposed to an intervention designed to activate a negative image of aging. 2) To test the hypothesis that reinforcement of positive stereotypes of race and aging will enhance the cardiovascular response to stress, walking performance and cognitive function in older African Americans. The results of this study should pave the way for the development of interventions that extend the short-term benefits of positive reinforcement of the stereotypes of age and race, thereby improving the function and health status of a growing portion of our aging population.

"Older Minority Women and the provider patient encounter It is well documented that there are large disparities in health outcomes between older minority women and older white women. Barriers to optimal health care for older minority women are many, and include poor communication and cross-cultural misunderstandings between them and their care providers. Yet research on older minority women's views of the provider-patient interaction is virtually non-existent. Their beliefs about factors that lead to satisfactory provider-patient interactions j are poorly understood, including their beliefs about the benefits of assertiveness. It is also not known how these beliefs might be linked to cultural factors. The proposed study will examine these issues through a qualitative focus group approach with community-dwelling arid institutionalized older women from multiple ethnic groups. Pilot information from the proposed study will be used to develop culturally-appropriate survey instruments for a larger follow-up study on older minority women's provider-patient interactions. The long-term objective for this; line of research is to develop culturally-appropriate educational strategies to encourage effective communication between older  minority women and their providers.

"RURAL ELDERS' DIABETES SELF MANAGEMENT--ETHNIC VARIATION   DESCRIPTION: Older adults with diabetes who properly self-manage this disease        can decrease their risk of severe complications and age more successfully.           Diabetes and diabetic complications are major causes of mortality and                morbidity; they are often devastating for patients and extremely costly to the       health care system. Diabetes disproportionately affects minority populations,        making it a major source of health disparity. While specific self-management         intervention programs exist, members of rural and ethnic minority populations        have little access to such programs and programs may not be culturally               appropriate. Few programs are designed to meet the special needs of elderly          populations. Little research has considered diabetes self-management strategies      used by older adults, particularly older rural and minority adults. This             project focuses on the self-management strategies used by rural older adults of      different ethnicities (African American, Native American, European American) to      manage Type 2 diabetes. The research combines survey and qualitative methods to      produce an in-depth understanding of self-management. The specific aims are to:      (1) document the diabetes self- management strategies of community-dwelling          rural older adults with Type 2 diabetes; (2) compare and contrast the diabetes       self-management strategies of older adults by ethnic group; (3) identify             cultural, social, economic, and life course predictors of and barriers to            diabetes self-management; and (4) evaluate diabetes self-management strategies       of older adults using a series of psychosocial and functional measures. This         study will be guided by a conceptual framework of health self-management based       on the investigators' ongoing work, and it will be conducted in 2 rural              counties where the investigators have established a successful presence. The         study has 2 components. Component 1 is a survey of 482 adults, aged 65 and           older with diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. This sample will be equally divided among      the 6 gender- ethnic groups, and it will be drawn using HCFA files. A computer       assisted personal interview will be used to collect background characteristics,      personality, self-management resources, self-management activities and outcome       measures (e.g., Hemoglobin A1C, depression, quality of life). Component 2            includes in-depth interviews with 15 experts who provide diabetes services, and      48 older adults with diabetes. Expert selection will be based on the                 investigators' knowledge of the counties; older adults will be selected from         the survey sample and include equal numbers by gender, ethnicity and glucose         control. In-depth interview data will be used to explore the community context       for diabetes self- management, as well as the processes by which older adults        develop and maintain a self-management strategy. Multivariate techniques will        be used in the analysis of the survey data. A systematic approach will be used       to analyze the qualitative data.

"SC Cooperative for Healthy Aging in Minority Populations  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The over arching goal of this RCMAR is to move beyond the identification and description of older African American/Caucasian health-related disparities to understanding the disparities within the African American population and identifying solutions designed to address these health issues. (Geiger, 1996).  Our theme is to improve the process of health care delivery for older African Americans by addressing issues and interventions related to providers and provider/patient interactions.  RCMAR investigators will focus on developing measurement tools and testing recruitment/retention approaches needed to test interventions.  If the interventions are successful, RCMAR investigators hope to move the interventions forward to statewide implementation.   Through its Cores, the South Carolina RCMAR will: (1) establish a mechanism for mentoring research careers focused on the health of older African Americans (see Investigator Development Core); (2) enhance cultural diversity of the workforce conducting research on the health of older African Americans (see Investigator Development Core); (3) conduct research on and deploy strategies for recruiting and retaining African Americans in social, behavioral, economic, epidemiologic, and/or biomedical interventional research dealing with the health of the elderly (see Community Liaison Core); (4) facilitate innovative strategies to support enduring research careers in minority health and aging, and/or encourage recruitment of established researchers to undertake research on minority health and aging (see Investigator Development Core); (5) improve the research methods and tools necessary to conduct rigorous and comparable research in diverse populations (see Measurement Core); (6) advance scientific knowledge leading to a decrease in health disparities (goal of Community Liaison Core, Investigator Development Core through Pilot Studies, and Measurement Core); and (7) disseminate research results to scientific and nonscientific communities addressing the resolution of health disparities through the ultimate improvement of the health of older African Americans (see Administrative, Investigator Development, and Community Liaison Cores).

"Measurement of Gender Differences in Disability and Care Demographic projections indicate that populating aging is imminent in the Middle East, and sex differences in longevity mean that these growing older populations increasingly consist of women. It is well documented that females at other ages have poorer survival prospects and less access to health care compared to males in the region. Because little is known about older adults in general, the extent to which such disparities persist in later life remains unexplored. A related concern is that instruments previously used in this and other developing regions to assess health status and use of services among older adults have not been adequately tested in these cultures. The validity and reliability of survey instruments are relevant to substantive are relevant to substantive questions about gender differences, given that the validity and reliability of self-reported health status and access to care are known to differ by gender elsewhere.. Therefore, prior to exploring the relationship of gender to health status and service use among older adults in the Middle East, relevant instruments need to be validate for use in this setting. The purpose of this pilot project is to test on a representative sample of non-institutionalized older adults in Egypt the validity and reliability of questionnaires that have routinely been used to measure health status and service use among similar populations in industrialized settings. The specific goals of this study are to: 1. determine the feasibility of conducting home-based tests of physical performance in a disadvantaged population of older adults in Egypt, 2. (a) assess the validity of self-reported data on functional limitation in   this population, (b) compare the validity of self reported functional limitation by gender, 3. (a) assess the reliability of self-reports of other health conditions and  use of health services in this population, and   (b) compare the reliability of self-reports of other health conditions and of use of services by gender. The project site will be Minia, Egypt, and a public use dataset will be made available in due course so that fellow researchers can examine other questions about health and aging in this study population.  This study will address important methodological questions about the utility of health interview surveys to gather information on older adults (defined here as age greater than or equal too 50 years) in less developed settings. Being among the first to validate in a developing region instruments that were designed to measure health status and service use among older populations in industrialized countries, this study will answer long-standing questions about the cross-cultural applicability of these instruments. In doing so, findings will provide an indication of the accuracy and reliability of existing self-reported data on health status and service use among older populations in other developing countries where similar instruments have been administered without prior validation.  Findings may also inform future revisions to estimates of the global burden of disease, for which little reliable information has been available from developing countries. Finally, answers to the methodological questions that motivate this project will enable the study team to develop well-designed instruments and procedures for data collection to be used in subsequent studies of the level and determinants of differences by gender in health status and use of modern health care at older ages in Egypt and other Middle Eastern settings.

"Synergistic Effects of Ethnicity & Older Age in HIV/AIDS The proposed pilot study addresses two topic areas: 1) HIV/AIDS and Aging and 2) Racial/Ethnic Differences and Health Disparities.  The primarily objective of the proposed study is to examine the synergistic effects of ethnicity and older age on neurocognitive functioning in HIV-infected adults. Ethnic disparities exist in the rate of HIV infection and mortality, relative to European Americans. As highly active anti-retroviral therapy permits HIV seropositive (HIV+) individuals to live longer, there is also a growing number of HIV+ individuals who are over the age of 50 and appear to be at increased risk for poor health outcome. Older African Americans may be at greatest risk for poor neurocognitive outcome because of the combined effects of age- and HIV- related cognitive decline as well as other factors that put them at increased risk for poor health (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, low socioeconomic status). Despite the high prevalence of HIV infection in African Americans and the growing number of older individuals infected with HIV, there has been minimal research investigating ethic differences in the neurocognitive sequelae of HIV infection especially in older HIV+ persons. The central aim of the proposed investigation is to examine the synergistic effects of ethnicity and older age on neurocognitive functioning in 1  HIV+ adults (50 African American; 50 European American); fifty percent of the participants will be over age 50. Another object is to identify those factors that differentially predict neurocognitive outcome in HIV+ African Americans and European Americans. Multivariate analyses of variance will be used to examine the effects of age and ethnicity, and the interactive effects of both on neurocognitive functions particularly affected by the aging process and HIV/AIDS. In addition to main effects for age and ethnicity, it is hypothesized that older African American participants will evidence particularly poor neurocognitive functioning. After accounting for age, education, and income, it is expected that acculturation and health risk factors that disproportionately affect African Americans (e.g., hypertension) will account for these ethnic disparities.

"RURAL ELDERS' DIABETES SELF MANAGEMENT--ETHNIC VARIATION   DESCRIPTION: Older adults with diabetes who properly self-manage this disease        can decrease their risk of severe complications and age more successfully.           Diabetes and diabetic complications are major causes of mortality and                morbidity; they are often devastating for patients and extremely costly to the       health care system. Diabetes disproportionately affects minority populations,        making it a major source of health disparity. While specific self-management         intervention programs exist, members of rural and ethnic minority populations        have little access to such programs and programs may not be culturally               appropriate. Few programs are designed to meet the special needs of elderly          populations. Little research has considered diabetes self-management strategies      used by older adults, particularly older rural and minority adults. This             project focuses on the self-management strategies used by rural older adults of      different ethnicities (African American, Native American, European American) to      manage Type 2 diabetes. The research combines survey and qualitative methods to      produce an in-depth understanding of self-management. The specific aims are to:      (1) document the diabetes self- management strategies of community-dwelling          rural older adults with Type 2 diabetes; (2) compare and contrast the diabetes       self-management strategies of older adults by ethnic group; (3) identify             cultural, social, economic, and life course predictors of and barriers to            diabetes self-management; and (4) evaluate diabetes self-management strategies       of older adults using a series of psychosocial and functional measures. This         study will be guided by a conceptual framework of health self-management based       on the investigators' ongoing work, and it will be conducted in 2 rural              counties where the investigators have established a successful presence. The         study has 2 components. Component 1 is a survey of 482 adults, aged 65 and           older with diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. This sample will be equally divided among      the 6 gender- ethnic groups, and it will be drawn using HCFA files. A computer       assisted personal interview will be used to collect background characteristics,      personality, self-management resources, self-management activities and outcome       measures (e.g., Hemoglobin A1C, depression, quality of life). Component 2            includes in-depth interviews with 15 experts who provide diabetes services, and      48 older adults with diabetes. Expert selection will be based on the                 investigators' knowledge of the counties; older adults will be selected from         the survey sample and include equal numbers by gender, ethnicity and glucose         control. In-depth interview data will be used to explore the community context       for diabetes self- management, as well as the processes by which older adults        develop and maintain a self-management strategy. Multivariate techniques will        be used in the analysis of the survey data. A systematic approach will be used       to analyze the qualitative data.

"Cancer Control at the Intersection of Aging Research  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dr. Mandelblatt is a geriatrician with health services and epidemiology training.  She is currently Director of Cancer Control at Lombardi Cancer Center.  Dr. Mandelblatt has a long history of continuous peer-reviewed funding almost $31 million and centered on translational research for individuals 65 years and older (hereinafter referred to as ""elderly"" or ""older"").  Dr. Mandelblatt's focus on understanding and eliminating age and race disparities in cancer care miletus national priorities.  For instance, the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has recently renewed its ""war on cancer"" by declaring the elimination of age (and race) disparities as a key priority.  The National Cancer Institute Year 2010 goals echo this priority.  The importance of these national cancer control objectives is cast on the backdrop of the changing demographic profile of the US:  by the year 2030, one in five will be elderly and 40 percent will be from minority groups.  Despite this ""demographic imperative"" and rising cancer rates with advancing age, there is a shortage of researchers trained to address the needs of diverse older populations.  Dr. Mandelblatt is one a small cadre of scientists in the US with this expertise.  One important cancer care gap, recently identified by the Institute of Medicine, is under use of chemotherapy.  However, we know little about treatment decision making in regional breast cancer, where chemotherapy can have substantial benefits.  Moreover, there is a paucity of data on quality of life and clinical outcomes of therapy in older women.  Chemotherapy decision making is particularly complex for older women owing to limited age-related data on cancer biology, potential treatment toxicity, interactions of treatment and comorbidity, limitations in physical, social, and economic resources, and possible biases in care delivery.  The research and mentoring proposed in this application will address these issues.  The specific objectives proposed for this award are threefold:  (1) To conduct theory-based research on patient preferences and clinical characteristics affecting decisions about use of systemic non-hormonal chemotherapy in older women with regional breast cancer, (2) To develop a research database infrastructure to conduct new studies about potential race and age-related biases in care, and (3) To develop a training infrastructure to develop young investigators in population sciences, behavioral research, and cancer control for older individuals.  With this award, Dr. Mandelblatt will be able to continue her commitment to gero-oncology, have sufficient protected time to train new investigators in this nascent field, and address new research innovations to advance the science of cancer control at the intersection of aging.

"Geriatric Resources for Assessment and Care of Elders   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are proposing an innovative strategy to      reduce fragmentation and improve the quality of care for a population of low           income older adults with multiple chronic conditions and high health care            costs. Prior studies have hypothesized that if the preventive care and               ambulatory care for vulnerable older adults could be improved then disability,       hospitalizations, nursing home placements, and costs could be reduced.               Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that disparities in health outcomes       among poor urban older adults might be reduced through efforts to improve the        underdiagnosis and undertreatment of common geriatric syndromes. The most            powerful interventions to achieve quality improvement for older adults involve       system-level changes rather than interventions targeted at individual                providers.                                                                                                                                                                The specific aim of this proposal is to conduct a four-year randomized               controlled clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a collaborative model of      team care as compared to usual care in improving functional outcomes among           community-dwelling low-income older adults.                                                                                                                               This collaborative model of team care, Geriatric Resources for Assessment and        Collaborative Care of Elders (GRACE) builds on the growing body of geriatric         health services research suggesting that coordinated care across the continuum       of care may improve outcomes for patients with chronic illness. The proposed         intervention involves a geriatric nurse practitioner and a geriatric social          worker caring for the vulnerable older adult in collaboration with the               patient's primary care physician and in consultation with a geriatric specialty      team. The specific components of GRACE mirror those recommended in recent            reviews: a) specific targeting of elders at risk; b) availability of                 collaborative expertise in geriatrics; c) integration of the program into            primary care; d) coordination of care across all sites of care; e) integration       of data systems that support physician's practice and facilitate monitoring of       pertinent clinical parameters; and f) institutionally endorsed clinical              practice guidelines. We are hypothesizing that, compared to usual care,              patients enrolled in the intervention will have: greater independence in             activities of daily living, better health status scores, fewer nursing home          days, and fewer hospitalizations over 2 years of follow-up.

"SC Cooperative for Healthy Aging in Minority Populations  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The over arching goal of this RCMAR is to move beyond the identification and description of older African American/Caucasian health-related disparities to understanding the disparities within the African American population and identifying solutions designed to address these health issues. (Geiger, 1996).  Our theme is to improve the process of health care delivery for older African Americans by addressing issues and interventions related to providers and provider/patient interactions.  RCMAR investigators will focus on developing measurement tools and testing recruitment/retention approaches needed to test interventions.  If the interventions are successful, RCMAR investigators hope to move the interventions forward to statewide implementation.   Through its Cores, the South Carolina RCMAR will: (1) establish a mechanism for mentoring research careers focused on the health of older African Americans (see Investigator Development Core); (2) enhance cultural diversity of the workforce conducting research on the health of older African Americans (see Investigator Development Core); (3) conduct research on and deploy strategies for recruiting and retaining African Americans in social, behavioral, economic, epidemiologic, and/or biomedical interventional research dealing with the health of the elderly (see Community Liaison Core); (4) facilitate innovative strategies to support enduring research careers in minority health and aging, and/or encourage recruitment of established researchers to undertake research on minority health and aging (see Investigator Development Core); (5) improve the research methods and tools necessary to conduct rigorous and comparable research in diverse populations (see Measurement Core); (6) advance scientific knowledge leading to a decrease in health disparities (goal of Community Liaison Core, Investigator Development Core through Pilot Studies, and Measurement Core); and (7) disseminate research results to scientific and nonscientific communities addressing the resolution of health disparities through the ultimate improvement of the health of older African Americans (see Administrative, Investigator Development, and Community Liaison Cores).

"VALIDATION OF A PREPARATION FOR FUTURE CARE MEASURE WITH OLDER AFRICAN-AMERICANS This proposal is in response to PAR-02-049 NIA Pilot Research Grant Program. It addresses Research Objective #20 (Racial/Ethnic Disparities), but also #24 (Improved Measures and Methodologies) and #12 (Cognition in Context). R03 funding is sought to validate a measure of Preparation for Future Care 0PFC) in a sample of older African-Americans and to validate a brief measure of PFC. Background: PFC is defined as thoughts or actions aimed at optimizing the care received in late adulthood. Thoughts and actions might include identifying sources of aid and arranging coverage of long-term care. PFC is important because it may buffer the adverse effects of chronic, progressive illnesses and functional limitations. The most widely used measure to assess PFC, the ""Preparation for Future Care Needs"" instrument (PFCN), has not been validated for use with minority participants, and its discriminant validity has not been established with regard to cognitive measures and measures of attitudes and emotions about the future. Also, the 47-item measure is too lengthy to use in some research and clinical contexts. Method: Data will be collected from 200 African-American and 200 White older adults in the Rochester area. Participants will be asked to complete a 47-item PFC survey and a 21 item short form within 4 weeks of each other. They will also complete measures of everyday cognition (e.g., how to locate a phone number in the yellow pages), basic cognitive functioning (e.g., memory, tracking, inductive reasoning, comprehension), and emotional/attitudinal measures (e.g., planfulness, death anxiety, dementia anxiety). Covariates will include socio-economic variables, health care access, health status, and limitations in activities of daily living. The development of a valid short measure of PFC is fundamental to conducting future large-scale longitudinal studies of adaptation to increased illness and disability, in which only brief measures are feasible. The information gained will also contribute to the development of a screening tool for practitioners assisting older adults with care plans.

"Center for Research/Nutrition & Health among the Elderly    (Revised Abstract) DESCRIPTION:  Puerto Rican older adults living in the U.S. mainland have been identified as a group highly at risk of excess chronic conditions, particularly diabetes, depression, and physical impairment. Few studies have been conducted on this rapidly growing and generally low-income ethnic group. To reduce health disparities, it is necessary to understand the factors that combine to progress to poor health outcomes. The overall aim of this Center is to perform a series of inter-related studies involving a cohort of older adults of Puerto Rican origin to evaluate specific stressors affecting the Puerto Rican community, and to determine the effect of these stressors on allostatic load and, in turn, on disease-specific outcomes. The Center will include four research projects. Project 1 is a prospective 2-year cohort study that will investigate both baseline and 2-year prospective associations between psychosocial stressors and allostatic load; and in turn, allostatic load and functional decline, specifically depression, cognitive decline and physical disability; along with the role of support, and vitamin intake and status in modifying these associations. Project 2 is a sociological investigation of psychosocial stressors and their measurement using both qualitative and quantitative methodology to gain contextual understanding of the sources of stress in this population that relate to allostatic load, and adapt instruments for its measurement. Project 3 consists of intervention studies. Using subsets of the baseline study, researchers will investigate the effectiveness of three different 2-year interventions in reducing indicators of allostatic load. Each is designed to be feasible for expansion by community agencies if effective. These include: 1) vitamin supplementation; 2) food coupons and nutrition education; and 3) social support and participation. Project 4 will investigate genetic contributions of allostatic load. Investigators will explore the relationship between selected gene variants and allostatic load at baseline and with change over time, and will investigate the interaction between gene variants and responses to the differing nutrition and social interventions. Three cores will work with all projects, including administrative, statistical, and laboratory cores. A pilot grants program during years 2 through 4 will encourage additional investigations relevant to the Center theme.

"CUSTODIAL GRANDPARENTS AND RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY This proposal is in response to PAR-02-049 to reduce health disparities among older persons and populations by conducting research to disentangle the effects of socio-economic status, social and environmental factors, health behaviors, and race and ethnicity on health. There has been a steady increase in the number of Afi'ican American custodial grandparents. Many grandparent caregivers experience stress, decreased social and economic well-being and reduced physical health as a result of caregiving. As interest in this area grows, questions as to methods grandparents use to cope with the stress ofcaregiving increase. There is a paucity of data available on the use of religious and spiritual practices among grandparents who raise their grandchildren. Preliminary results suggest that Afi'ican American custodial grandparents are very religious and spiritual, and that religiosity and spirituality may serve as coping mechanisms for grandparents who are primary caregivers for their grandchildren. Research in the area of cognition and aging suggests that there may be differences in the cognitive abilities of those actively involved in social activities. Preliminary results suggest that older African Americans that gave support have higher levels of everyday problem solving abilities. The primary aim of this study is to examine the impact of the social activities many custodial grandparents engage in which include religious activities and activities surrounding raising their grandchildren as a protective factor against the stressors associated with caregiving and a method to enhance their cognitive abilities. While designed primarily to assess the relation between the stressors of custodial grandparenting, religion/spirituality and cognition, the proposed study has clinical and policy implications. Clinically, the results of the proposed study could help identify topics to be addressed in grandparent caregiver support groups, such as problem solving skills and coping skills. It will also aid in assessing the types of practical skills needed to provide care for other. In the realm of policy, the results of the current study could identify the areas of concern for grandparent caregivers, such as obtaining access to medical care for their grandchildren. The research team includes the principal investigator and the consultant. The investigators have prior experience, publications, and preliminary data on working with older African Americans.

"Geriatric Resources for Assessment and Care of Elders   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are proposing an innovative strategy to      reduce fragmentation and improve the quality of care for a population of low           income older adults with multiple chronic conditions and high health care            costs. Prior studies have hypothesized that if the preventive care and               ambulatory care for vulnerable older adults could be improved then disability,       hospitalizations, nursing home placements, and costs could be reduced.               Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that disparities in health outcomes       among poor urban older adults might be reduced through efforts to improve the        underdiagnosis and undertreatment of common geriatric syndromes. The most            powerful interventions to achieve quality improvement for older adults involve       system-level changes rather than interventions targeted at individual                providers.                                                                                                                                                                The specific aim of this proposal is to conduct a four-year randomized               controlled clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a collaborative model of      team care as compared to usual care in improving functional outcomes among           community-dwelling low-income older adults.                                                                                                                               This collaborative model of team care, Geriatric Resources for Assessment and        Collaborative Care of Elders (GRACE) builds on the growing body of geriatric         health services research suggesting that coordinated care across the continuum       of care may improve outcomes for patients with chronic illness. The proposed         intervention involves a geriatric nurse practitioner and a geriatric social          worker caring for the vulnerable older adult in collaboration with the               patient's primary care physician and in consultation with a geriatric specialty      team. The specific components of GRACE mirror those recommended in recent            reviews: a) specific targeting of elders at risk; b) availability of                 collaborative expertise in geriatrics; c) integration of the program into            primary care; d) coordination of care across all sites of care; e) integration       of data systems that support physician's practice and facilitate monitoring of       pertinent clinical parameters; and f) institutionally endorsed clinical              practice guidelines. We are hypothesizing that, compared to usual care,              patients enrolled in the intervention will have: greater independence in             activities of daily living, better health status scores, fewer nursing home          days, and fewer hospitalizations over 2 years of follow-up.

"RURAL ELDERS' DIABETES SELF MANAGEMENT--ETHNIC VARIATION   DESCRIPTION: Older adults with diabetes who properly self-manage this disease        can decrease their risk of severe complications and age more successfully.           Diabetes and diabetic complications are major causes of mortality and                morbidity; they are often devastating for patients and extremely costly to the       health care system. Diabetes disproportionately affects minority populations,        making it a major source of health disparity. While specific self-management         intervention programs exist, members of rural and ethnic minority populations        have little access to such programs and programs may not be culturally               appropriate. Few programs are designed to meet the special needs of elderly          populations. Little research has considered diabetes self-management strategies      used by older adults, particularly older rural and minority adults. This             project focuses on the self-management strategies used by rural older adults of      different ethnicities (African American, Native American, European American) to      manage Type 2 diabetes. The research combines survey and qualitative methods to      produce an in-depth understanding of self-management. The specific aims are to:      (1) document the diabetes self- management strategies of community-dwelling          rural older adults with Type 2 diabetes; (2) compare and contrast the diabetes       self-management strategies of older adults by ethnic group; (3) identify             cultural, social, economic, and life course predictors of and barriers to            diabetes self-management; and (4) evaluate diabetes self-management strategies       of older adults using a series of psychosocial and functional measures. This         study will be guided by a conceptual framework of health self-management based       on the investigators' ongoing work, and it will be conducted in 2 rural              counties where the investigators have established a successful presence. The         study has 2 components. Component 1 is a survey of 482 adults, aged 65 and           older with diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. This sample will be equally divided among      the 6 gender- ethnic groups, and it will be drawn using HCFA files. A computer       assisted personal interview will be used to collect background characteristics,      personality, self-management resources, self-management activities and outcome       measures (e.g., Hemoglobin A1C, depression, quality of life). Component 2            includes in-depth interviews with 15 experts who provide diabetes services, and      48 older adults with diabetes. Expert selection will be based on the                 investigators' knowledge of the counties; older adults will be selected from         the survey sample and include equal numbers by gender, ethnicity and glucose         control. In-depth interview data will be used to explore the community context       for diabetes self- management, as well as the processes by which older adults        develop and maintain a self-management strategy. Multivariate techniques will        be used in the analysis of the survey data. A systematic approach will be used       to analyze the qualitative data.

"Health Access/Utilization Behavior of Older Black Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In order to operationalize and develop preventative/therapeutic health delivery systems into tangible outcomes that successfully meet the needs of any vulnerable sub-population, researchers must examine and understand the multiple meanings of the social categories of race, gender and old age that can lead to cumulative vulnerability. The study will specifically draw on two distinct sample populations of older African American women (aged 40-55 and 56 and over), and will include women who have utilized preventative health care services (e.g. mammograms, and other screening tests) and those who have not. It is reasoned that women of these two age groups may have distinct health care seeking behavior, different social support networks, as well as divergent health conditions associated with aging. The proposed study will obtain detailed qualitative information on life events, as well as quantitative information on the use of preventative and curative health care services by older African American women. This study will utilize key informants and document African American women's health care seeking behavior through individual in-depth interviews with (40) women and focus group interviews. In addition, focus groups will be conducted with health care providers/practitioners who work with this population. A mixed method approach allows for a more careful, detailed investigation of how predisposing, enabling and service factors may impact decisions to access and utilize preventive services (e.g., annual physicals, mammograms, pap smears, etc.) as well as curative health care services (e.g., follow-up, therapeutic services, etc).

"Diabetes Perceptions, Patient Satisfaction and Self-Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is a serious, chronic disease more prevalent in older adults and minorities. Documented differences in patient and provider perception of basic diabetes concepts used during medical interactions are likely to negatively influence patient outcomes. Further, because communication difficulties are frequent with older and minority patients, these patients may be at increased risk. Acknowledging and understanding differences in perceptions will improve the communication between providers and patients resulting in improved patient self-care behavior, greater patient satisfaction, and subsequently better patient outcomes. Utilizing a correlational design, the study aims to increase our understanding of patient behavior, motivation and expectations. Greater knowledge of the impact of diabetes on African Americans, in particular, may generate interventions that decrease the health disparity in this population. The study's finding will provide a foundation for the development of educational and behavioral interventions focused on diversity and cultural assessment in the clinical encounter. Building on our previous research with minority populations with diabetes, we will examine the understanding of diabetes-related concepts of health care providers, older African American patients with diabetes and older Caucasian patients with diabetes. Both patient and provider samples will be selected from the general community. Our long-term goals are to improve provider-patient communication and mutual understanding, and to increase both patient satisfaction and patient self-care behavior. The study has the following four aims:   AIM 1: To identify and reliably measure the differences between health care providers' and patients' perception of diabetes concepts.   AIM 2: To determine if differences between health care providers' and patients' perception of diabetes concepts influence patient self-care behavior.   AIM 3: To determine if differences between health care providers' and patients' perception of diabetes concepts influences patient satisfaction with their diabetes care.   AIM 4: To investigate the influence of the patients' ethnicity, age, education, and gender on perception differences of diabetes.

"RELIGION, AGING, AND HEALTH    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this competing continuation application is to seek additional funds to continue work on the National Institute on Aging (NIA)-supported project: ""Religion, Aging, and Health"" (RO 1 AG14749). The first four years of this study were spent developing a comprehensive set of survey items to measure religion in late life. This research culminated in a nationwide survey of older whites and older African Americans (Wave 1) that was completed in 2001. A total of 1,500 older adults were interviewed successfully for the nationwide survey. Analysis of the nationwide data suggests that the newly devised religion items have sound psychometric properties, and that these measures are related to health and psychological well being in theoretically meaningful ways. Funds are requested to conduct three more waves of interviews (Waves 2 - 4) with all subjects who participated in the baseline survey (Wave 1). These additional waves of data will be used to address the following specific aims: 1.) To explore the relationships among gender, religion, and health; 2.) To examine the interface between stressful life events, religion, and health; and 3.) To continue research on race differences in religion and health among older whites and older blacks.  A wide range of state-of-the-art data analytic procedures will be used to empirically evaluate these issues.

"El ejercicio y su Salud: Nunca es Tarde Para Empezar    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):  Advances in diagnosis and treatment outcomes of major medical conditions have increased life expectancy and the average number of years lived without a limiting disease or disability. There exists, however, a marked disparity in the active life expectancy and quality of life among different racial and ethnic groups. To support the National Institutes on Aging (NIA) in its efforts to better address the disparities in the ""active life expectancy"" of older Hispanics, The Media Network, Inc. is to research, develop, produce, evaluate, and distribute a Spanish-language exercise videotape, trainer's manual and poster for widespread use among older Hispanics. In Phase 1, the principal investigator will conduct formative research and testing to evaluate concepts on the program's safety, cultural and social acceptability and effectiveness. The product will largely be based on the Spanish-language exercise guide titled ""El Ejercicio Y Su Salud."" The exercise guide was produced by The Media Network in conjunction with NIA and was awarded First Place in the Blue Pencil/Gold Screen Competition sponsored by the National Association of Government Communicators. In Phase 2, The Media Network, Inc. will professionally produce the videotape of a unique Spanish-language exercise program and create accompanying training materials. In Phase 3, the videotape will be marketed, and distributed for community use by older Hispanics. Accompanying promotional and training materials will be created and by using its extensive network of community-based Hispanic groups, The Media Network will also promote and distribute the video. The final component of the project will be an evaluation of the campaign and product's effectiveness. Completion of the tasks outlined in this application will result in a professionally produced and field-tested Spanish-language exercise program designed for older Hispanics. Improving health behaviors and health maintenance strategies with culturally competent and appropriate educational materials can only be achieved through effective, safe, and enjoyable programs that are widely available and marketed to the aging Hispanic population. The final product will fill a critical void in exercise training products targeting Hispanics and has the potential of achieving a comprehensive and beneficial impact on the overall fitness of the older Hispanic community in the US.         ",El ejercicio y su Salud: Nunca es Tarde Para Empezar,6647531,R43AG022255,"['health education ', ' exercise ', ' body physical activity ', ' nonEnglish language ', ' Hispanic American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' functional ability ', ' clinical research ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,"MEDIA NETWORK, INC.",R43,2003,99919,0.021316371419566674
"Cancer Control at the Intersection of Aging Research  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dr. Mandelblatt is a geriatrician with health services and epidemiology training.  She is currently Director of Cancer Control at Lombardi Cancer Center.  Dr. Mandelblatt has a long history of continuous peer-reviewed funding almost $31 million and centered on translational research for individuals 65 years and older (hereinafter referred to as ""elderly"" or ""older"").  Dr. Mandelblatt's focus on understanding and eliminating age and race disparities in cancer care miletus national priorities.  For instance, the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has recently renewed its ""war on cancer"" by declaring the elimination of age (and race) disparities as a key priority.  The National Cancer Institute Year 2010 goals echo this priority.  The importance of these national cancer control objectives is cast on the backdrop of the changing demographic profile of the US:  by the year 2030, one in five will be elderly and 40 percent will be from minority groups.  Despite this ""demographic imperative"" and rising cancer rates with advancing age, there is a shortage of researchers trained to address the needs of diverse older populations.  Dr. Mandelblatt is one a small cadre of scientists in the US with this expertise.  One important cancer care gap, recently identified by the Institute of Medicine, is under use of chemotherapy.  However, we know little about treatment decision making in regional breast cancer, where chemotherapy can have substantial benefits.  Moreover, there is a paucity of data on quality of life and clinical outcomes of therapy in older women.  Chemotherapy decision making is particularly complex for older women owing to limited age-related data on cancer biology, potential treatment toxicity, interactions of treatment and comorbidity, limitations in physical, social, and economic resources, and possible biases in care delivery.  The research and mentoring proposed in this application will address these issues.  The specific objectives proposed for this award are threefold:  (1) To conduct theory-based research on patient preferences and clinical characteristics affecting decisions about use of systemic non-hormonal chemotherapy in older women with regional breast cancer, (2) To develop a research database infrastructure to conduct new studies about potential race and age-related biases in care, and (3) To develop a training infrastructure to develop young investigators in population sciences, behavioral research, and cancer control for older individuals.  With this award, Dr. Mandelblatt will be able to continue her commitment to gero-oncology, have sufficient protected time to train new investigators in this nascent field, and address new research innovations to advance the science of cancer control at the intersection of aging.

"Health Access/Utilization Behavior of Older Black Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In order to operationalize and develop preventative/therapeutic health delivery systems into tangible outcomes that successfully meet the needs of any vulnerable sub-population, researchers must examine and understand the multiple meanings of the social categories of race, gender and old age that can lead to cumulative vulnerability. The study will specifically draw on two distinct sample populations of older African American women (aged 40-55 and 56 and over), and will include women who have utilized preventative health care services (e.g. mammograms, and other screening tests) and those who have not. It is reasoned that women of these two age groups may have distinct health care seeking behavior, different social support networks, as well as divergent health conditions associated with aging. The proposed study will obtain detailed qualitative information on life events, as well as quantitative information on the use of preventative and curative health care services by older African American women. This study will utilize key informants and document African American women's health care seeking behavior through individual in-depth interviews with (40) women and focus group interviews. In addition, focus groups will be conducted with health care providers/practitioners who work with this population. A mixed method approach allows for a more careful, detailed investigation of how predisposing, enabling and service factors may impact decisions to access and utilize preventive services (e.g., annual physicals, mammograms, pap smears, etc.) as well as curative health care services (e.g., follow-up, therapeutic services, etc).

"Norms and Performance Comparisons for 5 Health indexes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a Program of Projects to advance the applied science of evaluating health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older U.S. adults. We simultaneously use four widely-used generic HRQOL instruments, the SF-36v2, EuroQol EQ-5D, Quality of Well-being scale (QWB-SA), and Health Utilities Index (HUI2/3). Additionally we use the HALex from the National Center for Health Statistics. Project 1 uses a telephone survey to interview a cross-sectional sample of 2800 non-institutionalized adult U.S. residents aged 35-89. Persons aged 65 and older will be over-sampled to provide higher precision in older ages. African Americans are over-sampled for the first national survey of substantial size (n=1000) of this important sub-population. Project 1 data will be used to construct gender- and age-specific national reference averages for HRQOL among older adults on all measures. Project 2 will use all four measures to follow treatment and 6 month recovery of patients with three age-related diseases stressing different aspects of HRQOL newly referred congestive heart failure, hip replacement for osteoarthritis, and cataract extraction. This project will establish characteristics of the measures for longitudinal follow-up of patients with self-administered questionnaires. Project 3 examines how duration of a health condition affects HRQOL assessments and how this affects interpretation of HRQOL scores from standardized indexes. This is particularly important in the elderly as medical care increasingly prolongs life with chronic conditions. Project 4 determines survey mode effects (telephone versus self-administration) for all instruments as well as English versus Spanish language administration for persons who are usually Spanish speakers. The Program will enhance health researchers' ability to measure, follow, and interpret HRQOL in adults and to assess health disparities.

"SC Cooperative for Healthy Aging in Minority Populations  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The over arching goal of this RCMAR is to move beyond the identification and description of older African American/Caucasian health-related disparities to understanding the disparities within the African American population and identifying solutions designed to address these health issues. (Geiger, 1996).  Our theme is to improve the process of health care delivery for older African Americans by addressing issues and interventions related to providers and provider/patient interactions.  RCMAR investigators will focus on developing measurement tools and testing recruitment/retention approaches needed to test interventions.  If the interventions are successful, RCMAR investigators hope to move the interventions forward to statewide implementation.   Through its Cores, the South Carolina RCMAR will: (1) establish a mechanism for mentoring research careers focused on the health of older African Americans (see Investigator Development Core); (2) enhance cultural diversity of the workforce conducting research on the health of older African Americans (see Investigator Development Core); (3) conduct research on and deploy strategies for recruiting and retaining African Americans in social, behavioral, economic, epidemiologic, and/or biomedical interventional research dealing with the health of the elderly (see Community Liaison Core); (4) facilitate innovative strategies to support enduring research careers in minority health and aging, and/or encourage recruitment of established researchers to undertake research on minority health and aging (see Investigator Development Core); (5) improve the research methods and tools necessary to conduct rigorous and comparable research in diverse populations (see Measurement Core); (6) advance scientific knowledge leading to a decrease in health disparities (goal of Community Liaison Core, Investigator Development Core through Pilot Studies, and Measurement Core); and (7) disseminate research results to scientific and nonscientific communities addressing the resolution of health disparities through the ultimate improvement of the health of older African Americans (see Administrative, Investigator Development, and Community Liaison Cores).   The long-range RCMAR infrastructure-building goals are to use the RCMAR research structure to develop interventions that will improve the health and well being of older African American populations in the State of South Carolina and reduce the health disparities suffered by African Americans in this state.

"RELIGION, AGING, AND HEALTH    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this competing continuation application is to seek additional funds to continue work on the National Institute on Aging (NIA)-supported project: ""Religion, Aging, and Health"" (RO 1 AG14749). The first four years of this study were spent developing a comprehensive set of survey items to measure religion in late life. This research culminated in a nationwide survey of older whites and older African Americans (Wave 1) that was completed in 2001. A total of 1,500 older adults were interviewed successfully for the nationwide survey. Analysis of the nationwide data suggests that the newly devised religion items have sound psychometric properties, and that these measures are related to health and psychological well being in theoretically meaningful ways. Funds are requested to conduct three more waves of interviews (Waves 2 - 4) with all subjects who participated in the baseline survey (Wave 1). These additional waves of data will be used to address the following specific aims: 1.) To explore the relationships among gender, religion, and health; 2.) To examine the interface between stressful life events, religion, and health; and 3.) To continue research on race differences in religion and health among older whites and older blacks.  A wide range of state-of-the-art data analytic procedures will be used to empirically evaluate these issues. Included among these procedures are individual growth curve models and latent variable structural equation models.         ","RELIGION, AGING, AND HEALTH",6805139,R01AG014749,"['human old age (65+) ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' health survey ', ' health behavior ', ' cognition ', ' lifestyle ', ' social group process ', ' gender difference ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' religion ', ' stress ', ' functional ability ', ' quality of life ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' psychological aspect of aging ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2004,564576,0.01062213975233045
"Multilevel Analysis of Formal & Informal Care in Sweden 24. Improved Measures and Methodologies. Past models of formal and informal care have focused on either the individual or macro level. As such, they have tended to ignore the role of supply-side and demand-side characteristics at the regional level or the individual-level availability of care needs and potential supports. By explicitly linking these two levels of data for two different time points, it is 3ossible to investigate how regional characteristics affect the extent and type of supports received by the individuals within them. The proposed pilot research will link individual and regional level data on formal and informal care systems in Sweden, a country which serves as an excellent starting 3oint for understanding health disparities and ethnocultural variation in care. The project aims first to identify regional demographic and formal care characteristics that are associated with formal and informal supports to older adults and rates of unmet need. A second aim is to determine whether longitudinal changes in demographic characteristics and availability of formal services have differentially affected women, the oldest old, those with little available kin support, and those with greatest functional impairment. Multilevel models will be used to address the study aims by linking statistics for 212 of Sweden's 289 municipalities with nationally representative individual data from these municipalities in 1994 (N = 1379) and 2000 (N = 1466). Levels of home help services have decreased in Sweden over this period while the older population in Sweden grows increasingly old and frail. This provides an ideal opportunity to examine how municipal level changes in home help services and demographic characteristics have affected the balance of ADL assistance that frail older Swedes receive from formal and informal sources and any resulting changes in rates of unmet need for assistance. Better understanding of the relation between formal and informal care systems has important implications for planning and design of services, and for finding more effective ways to support and sustain older adults and their families within the community.

"Cancer Control at the Intersection of Aging Research  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dr. Mandelblatt is a geriatrician with health services and epidemiology training.  She is currently Director of Cancer Control at Lombardi Cancer Center.  Dr. Mandelblatt has a long history of continuous peer-reviewed funding almost $31 million and centered on translational research for individuals 65 years and older (hereinafter referred to as ""elderly"" or ""older"").  Dr. Mandelblatt's focus on understanding and eliminating age and race disparities in cancer care miletus national priorities.  For instance, the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has recently renewed its ""war on cancer"" by declaring the elimination of age (and race) disparities as a key priority.  The National Cancer Institute Year 2010 goals echo this priority.  The importance of these national cancer control objectives is cast on the backdrop of the changing demographic profile of the US:  by the year 2030, one in five will be elderly and 40 percent will be from minority groups.  Despite this ""demographic imperative"" and rising cancer rates with advancing age, there is a shortage of researchers trained to address the needs of diverse older populations.  Dr. Mandelblatt is one a small cadre of scientists in the US with this expertise.  One important cancer care gap, recently identified by the Institute of Medicine, is under use of chemotherapy.  However, we know little about treatment decision making in regional breast cancer, where chemotherapy can have substantial benefits.  Moreover, there is a paucity of data on quality of life and clinical outcomes of therapy in older women.  Chemotherapy decision making is particularly complex for older women owing to limited age-related data on cancer biology, potential treatment toxicity, interactions of treatment and comorbidity, limitations in physical, social, and economic resources, and possible biases in care delivery.  The research and mentoring proposed in this application will address these issues.  The specific objectives proposed for this award are threefold:  (1) To conduct theory-based research on patient preferences and clinical characteristics affecting decisions about use of systemic non-hormonal chemotherapy in older women with regional breast cancer, (2) To develop a research database infrastructure to conduct new studies about potential race and age-related biases in care, and (3) To develop a training infrastructure to develop young investigators in population sciences, behavioral research, and cancer control for older individuals.  With this award, Dr. Mandelblatt will be able to continue her commitment to gero-oncology, have sufficient protected time to train new investigators in this nascent field, and address new research innovations to advance the science of cancer control at the intersection of aging.

"Diabetes Perceptions, Patient Satisfaction and Self-Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is a serious, chronic disease more prevalent in older adults and minorities. Documented differences in patient and provider perception of basic diabetes concepts used during medical interactions are likely to negatively influence patient outcomes. Further, because communication difficulties are frequent with older and minority patients, these patients may be at increased risk. Acknowledging and understanding differences in perceptions will improve the communication between providers and patients resulting in improved patient self-care behavior, greater patient satisfaction, and subsequently better patient outcomes. Utilizing a correlational design, the study aims to increase our understanding of patient behavior, motivation and expectations. Greater knowledge of the impact of diabetes on African Americans, in particular, may generate interventions that decrease the health disparity in this population. The study's finding will provide a foundation for the development of educational and behavioral interventions focused on diversity and cultural assessment in the clinical encounter. Building on our previous research with minority populations with diabetes, we will examine the understanding of diabetes-related concepts of health care providers, older African American patients with diabetes and older Caucasian patients with diabetes. Both patient and provider samples will be selected from the general community. Our long-term goals are to improve provider-patient communication and mutual understanding, and to increase both patient satisfaction and patient self-care behavior. The study has the following four aims:   AIM 1: To identify and reliably measure the differences between health care providers' and patients' perception of diabetes concepts.   AIM 2: To determine if differences between health care providers' and patients' perception of diabetes concepts influence patient self-care behavior.   AIM 3: To determine if differences between health care providers' and patients' perception of diabetes concepts influences patient satisfaction with their diabetes care.   AIM 4: To investigate the influence of the patients' ethnicity, age, education, and gender on perception differences of diabetes.

"Center for Research/Nutrition & Health among the Elderly    (Revised Abstract) DESCRIPTION:  Puerto Rican older adults living in the U.S. mainland have been identified as a group highly at risk of excess chronic conditions, particularly diabetes, depression, and physical impairment. Few studies have been conducted on this rapidly growing and generally low-income ethnic group. To reduce health disparities, it is necessary to understand the factors that combine to progress to poor health outcomes. The overall aim of this Center is to perform a series of inter-related studies involving a cohort of older adults of Puerto Rican origin to evaluate specific stressors affecting the Puerto Rican community, and to determine the effect of these stressors on allostatic load and, in turn, on disease-specific outcomes. The Center will include four research projects. Project 1 is a prospective 2-year cohort study that will investigate both baseline and 2-year prospective associations between psychosocial stressors and allostatic load; and in turn, allostatic load and functional decline, specifically depression, cognitive decline and physical disability; along with the role of support, and vitamin intake and status in modifying these associations. Project 2 is a sociological investigation of psychosocial stressors and their measurement using both qualitative and quantitative methodology to gain contextual understanding of the sources of stress in this population that relate to allostatic load, and adapt instruments for its measurement. Project 3 consists of intervention studies. Using subsets of the baseline study, researchers will investigate the effectiveness of three different 2-year interventions in reducing indicators of allostatic load. Each is designed to be feasible for expansion by community agencies if effective. These include: 1) vitamin supplementation; 2) food coupons and nutrition education; and 3) social support and participation. Project 4 will investigate genetic contributions of allostatic load. Investigators will explore the relationship between selected gene variants and allostatic load at baseline and with change over time, and will investigate the interaction between gene variants and responses to the differing nutrition and social interventions. Three cores will work with all projects, including administrative, statistical, and laboratory cores. A pilot grants program during years 2 through 4 will encourage additional investigations relevant to the Center theme.

"Geriatric Resources for Assessment and Care of Elders   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are proposing an innovative strategy to      reduce fragmentation and improve the quality of care for a population of low           income older adults with multiple chronic conditions and high health care            costs. Prior studies have hypothesized that if the preventive care and               ambulatory care for vulnerable older adults could be improved then disability,       hospitalizations, nursing home placements, and costs could be reduced.               Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that disparities in health outcomes       among poor urban older adults might be reduced through efforts to improve the        underdiagnosis and undertreatment of common geriatric syndromes. The most            powerful interventions to achieve quality improvement for older adults involve       system-level changes rather than interventions targeted at individual                providers.

The proposed         intervention involves a geriatric nurse practitioner and a geriatric social          worker caring for the vulnerable older adult in collaboration with the               patient's primary care physician and in consultation with a geriatric specialty      team. The specific components of GRACE mirror those recommended in recent            reviews: a) specific targeting of elders at risk; b) availability of                 collaborative expertise in geriatrics; c) integration of the program into            primary care; d) coordination of care across all sites of care; e) integration       of data systems that support physician's practice and facilitate monitoring of       pertinent clinical parameters; and f) institutionally endorsed clinical              practice guidelines.

"Cataract: Health Disparity for Older African-Americans African Americans have more visual impairment from cataract, and less cataract surgery, compared to Caucasians. While risk factors for cataract have been studied, specific determinants of cataract incidence and progression, and time to cataract surgery, comparing factors and their importance within racial groups has not been done. The aims of this research are: to determine the incidence and progression of cataract in an older population-based sample of African Americans compared to Caucasians; to determine predictive factors and their relative importance for incidence and progression; and to determine factors predicting time to cataract surgery for those with visually disabling cataract in each racial group. Prospective data have already been collected as part of the NIA funded SEE project; baseline, 2, 6, and 8 year data are available from the 2520 participants on UV exposure, alcohol and tobacco use, medications, diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, and other key risk factors. Ocular photographs were taken at baseline and graded for presence and severity of cortical, nuclear, and posterior sub-capsular cataract, and taken but not yet graded for follow up visits. Vision and physical function measures were taken at each round, enabling analyses of functional impact of cataract and predictors of seeking cataract surgery. Models will be constructed to determine risk factors for cataract incidence and progression, testing for interactions by racial groups. Level of visual impairment due to cataract and effect on physical function within racial groups will be used to model triggers for subsequent cataract surgery. Such data will increase knowledge of cataractogenic mechanisms within racial groups, and provide more understanding of disparites in seeking cataract surgery. These data will advance the goal of reducing health disparity in visual disability from cataract among older African Americans.

"Cancer Control at the Intersection of Aging Research  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dr. Mandelblatt is a geriatrician with health services and epidemiology training.  She is currently Director of Cancer Control at Lombardi Cancer Center.  Dr. Mandelblatt has a long history of continuous peer-reviewed funding almost $31 million and centered on translational research for individuals 65 years and older (hereinafter referred to as ""elderly"" or ""older"").  Dr. Mandelblatt's focus on understanding and eliminating age and race disparities in cancer care miletus national priorities.  For instance, the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has recently renewed its ""war on cancer"" by declaring the elimination of age (and race) disparities as a key priority.  The National Cancer Institute Year 2010 goals echo this priority.  The importance of these national cancer control objectives is cast on the backdrop of the changing demographic profile of the US:  by the year 2030, one in five will be elderly and 40 percent will be from minority groups.  Despite this ""demographic imperative"" and rising cancer rates with advancing age, there is a shortage of researchers trained to address the needs of diverse older populations.  Dr. Mandelblatt is one a small cadre of scientists in the US with this expertise.  One important cancer care gap, recently identified by the Institute of Medicine, is under use of chemotherapy.  However, we know little about treatment decision making in regional breast cancer, where chemotherapy can have substantial benefits.  Moreover, there is a paucity of data on quality of life and clinical outcomes of therapy in older women.  Chemotherapy decision making is particularly complex for older women owing to limited age-related data on cancer biology, potential treatment toxicity, interactions of treatment and comorbidity, limitations in physical, social, and economic resources, and possible biases in care delivery.  The research and mentoring proposed in this application will address these issues.  The specific objectives proposed for this award are threefold:  (1) To conduct theory-based research on patient preferences and clinical characteristics affecting decisions about use of systemic non-hormonal chemotherapy in older women with regional breast cancer, (2) To develop a research database infrastructure to conduct new studies about potential race and age-related biases in care, and (3) To develop a training infrastructure to develop young investigators in population sciences, behavioral research, and cancer control for older individuals.  With this award, Dr. Mandelblatt will be able to continue her commitment to gero-oncology, have sufficient protected time to train new investigators in this nascent field, and address new research innovations to advance the science of cancer control at the intersection of aging.

"Multilevel Analysis of Formal & Informal Care in Sweden 24. Improved Measures and Methodologies. Past models of formal and informal care have focused on either the individual or macro level. As such, they have tended to ignore the role of supply-side and demand-side characteristics at the regional level or the individual-level availability of care needs and potential supports. By explicitly linking these two levels of data for two different time points, it is 3ossible to investigate how regional characteristics affect the extent and type of supports received by the individuals within them. The proposed pilot research will link individual and regional level data on formal and informal care systems in Sweden, a country which serves as an excellent starting 3oint for understanding health disparities and ethnocultural variation in care. The project aims first to identify regional demographic and formal care characteristics that are associated with formal and informal supports to older adults and rates of unmet need. A second aim is to determine whether longitudinal changes in demographic characteristics and availability of formal services have differentially affected women, the oldest old, those with little available kin support, and those with greatest functional impairment. Multilevel models will be used to address the study aims by linking statistics for 212 of Sweden's 289 municipalities with nationally representative individual data from these municipalities in 1994 (N = 1379) and 2000 (N = 1466). Levels of home help services have decreased in Sweden over this period while the older population in Sweden grows increasingly old and frail. This provides an ideal opportunity to examine how municipal level changes in home help services and demographic characteristics have affected the balance of ADL assistance that frail older Swedes receive from formal and informal sources and any resulting changes in rates of unmet need for assistance. Better understanding of the relation between formal and informal care systems has important implications for planning and design of services, and for finding more effective ways to support and sustain older adults and their families within the community.

"Community and Individual Predictors of Health Inequality A wealth of research has demonstrated that there are health disparities between Black and White Americans that are enduring over time and pervasive into almost all health domains. With few exceptions, differences in income, education level, and insurance status has narrowed, but not accounted for the entire health gap between Black and White older adults. One possible reason why these individual-level measurements have failed to explain the racial health gap is that many health outcomes are influenced by one's environment. However, to date, research has primarily considered only individual characteristics such as personal economic resources and has virtually ignored the relative impact of ""place"" on the racial health disparity. The intent of this proposed study is to systematically examine both individual and community influences on the health disparity between Black and White adults ages 65 and older. This research will examine community-level measures (measured at the Census tract level) that have been linked with the North Carolina Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE), which is a multi-stage sample of 4,162 Black and White older adults from five counties in North Carolina, and employ multi-level models to estimate the relative influence of individual- and community-level characteristics on the subsequent physical functioning of Black and White older adults. This proposed project is one of the first to integrate broader context into the study of individual health outcomes for the purposes of examining the racial health disparity between Black and White older adults. There are three specific aims of this study: 1. Test the impact of community context, composition, and stability on geographic variations in the health of Black and White older adults. 2. Measure the relative influence of individual and community characteristics on the racial health disparity among older adults, specifically on ADL and IADL disability. 3. Determine whether vulnerability to community influences varies by race or socioeconomic status.

"Diabetes Perceptions, Patient Satisfaction and Self-Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is a serious, chronic disease more prevalent in older adults and minorities. Documented differences in patient and provider perception of basic diabetes concepts used during medical interactions are likely to negatively influence patient outcomes. Further, because communication difficulties are frequent with older and minority patients, these patients may be at increased risk. Acknowledging and understanding differences in perceptions will improve the communication between providers and patients resulting in improved patient self-care behavior, greater patient satisfaction, and subsequently better patient outcomes. Utilizing a correlational design, the study aims to increase our understanding of patient behavior, motivation and expectations. Greater knowledge of the impact of diabetes on African Americans, in particular, may generate interventions that decrease the health disparity in this population. The study's finding will provide a foundation for the development of educational and behavioral interventions focused on diversity and cultural assessment in the clinical encounter. Building on our previous research with minority populations with diabetes, we will examine the understanding of diabetes-related concepts of health care providers, older African American patients with diabetes and older Caucasian patients with diabetes. Both patient and provider samples will be selected from the general community. Our long-term goals are to improve provider-patient communication and mutual understanding, and to increase both patient satisfaction and patient self-care behavior. The study has the following four aims:   AIM 1: To identify and reliably measure the differences between health care providers' and patients' perception of diabetes concepts.   AIM 2: To determine if differences between health care providers' and patients' perception of diabetes concepts influence patient self-care behavior.   AIM 3: To determine if differences between health care providers' and patients' perception of diabetes concepts influences patient satisfaction with their diabetes care.   AIM 4: To investigate the influence of the patients' ethnicity, age, education, and gender on perception differences of diabetes.

"Center for Research/Nutrition & Health among the Elderly    (Revised Abstract) DESCRIPTION:  Puerto Rican older adults living in the U.S. mainland have been identified as a group highly at risk of excess chronic conditions, particularly diabetes, depression, and physical impairment. Few studies have been conducted on this rapidly growing and generally low-income ethnic group. To reduce health disparities, it is necessary to understand the factors that combine to progress to poor health outcomes. The overall aim of this Center is to perform a series of inter-related studies involving a cohort of older adults of Puerto Rican origin to evaluate specific stressors affecting the Puerto Rican community, and to determine the effect of these stressors on allostatic load and, in turn, on disease-specific outcomes. The Center will include four research projects. Project 1 is a prospective 2-year cohort study that will investigate both baseline and 2-year prospective associations between psychosocial stressors and allostatic load; and in turn, allostatic load and functional decline, specifically depression, cognitive decline and physical disability; along with the role of support, and vitamin intake and status in modifying these associations. Project 2 is a sociological investigation of psychosocial stressors and their measurement using both qualitative and quantitative methodology to gain contextual understanding of the sources of stress in this population that relate to allostatic load, and adapt instruments for its measurement. Project 3 consists of intervention studies. Using subsets of the baseline study, researchers will investigate the effectiveness of three different 2-year interventions in reducing indicators of allostatic load. Each is designed to be feasible for expansion by community agencies if effective. These include: 1) vitamin supplementation; 2) food coupons and nutrition education; and 3) social support and participation. Project 4 will investigate genetic contributions of allostatic load. Investigators will explore the relationship between selected gene variants and allostatic load at baseline and with change over time, and will investigate the interaction between gene variants and responses to the differing nutrition and social interventions. Three cores will work with all projects, including administrative, statistical, and laboratory cores. A pilot grants program during years 2 through 4 will encourage additional investigations relevant to the Center theme.

"Culture and Mobility Device Use in Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Use of assistive devices for mobility such as canes, crutches and walkers, can reduce the risk of falling, promote activity, prevent disability and increase autonomy. Yet, despite these benefits, many older adults do not use mobility devices. Effective interventions that promote appropriate use of mobility devices are needed however at this time we are lacking research to guide the design of culturally appropriate interventions that would meet the needs of an ethnically diverse older population. The purpose of this study is to explore the influence of culture on attitudes and social norms regarding aging, mobility impairments and use of assistive devices for mobility. This qualitative study will use grounded theory techniques and employ a multiple case study design to study elders from the three population groups: Caucasian, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics. Data will be collected by formal in-depth individual interviews with key informants and focus groups of older adults recruited from among the Ocean State Senior Dining centers, and elderly housing facilities in Rhode Island. Focus groups will be stratified on the basis of participants' self-identified race/ethnicity and 3-4 mini focus groups of each racial/ethnic group will be conducted. Focus groups of Spanish speaking elders will be led by a Spanish speaking moderator. Coding and analyzing the data will begin with open coding, the identification of broad, descriptive themes, and continue with the development of more theoretical or analytical themes. Constant comparison techniques will be used to continually refine the analysis based upon incoming data. Sampling of comparative informants and focus group members will contribute to explicating the phenomenon under study. Data analysis will continue until no new information is obtained and no new categories re formed. The results of this pilot study are intended to inform a subsequent, larger, intervention study aimed at improving adoption of assistive devices for mobility. Findings from this pilot study will help us understand similarities and differences in minority and Caucasian populations' view of functional decline and assistive device use, and to identify culturally sensitive ways to make interventions more appropriate for diverse populations.             ",Culture and Mobility Device Use in Older Adults,6849072,R03AG025094,"['human old age (65+) ', ' aging ', ' assistive device /technology ', ' person with disability ', ' rehabilitation ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' health behavior ', ' attitude ', ' motivation ', ' social perception ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' culture ', ' functional ability ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2005,77500,0.07380228022725945
"Norms and Performance Comparisons for 5 Health indexes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a Program of Projects to advance the applied science of evaluating health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older U.S. adults. We simultaneously use four widely-used generic HRQOL instruments, the SF-36v2, EuroQol EQ-5D, Quality of Well-being scale (QWB-SA), and Health Utilities Index (HUI2/3). Additionally we use the HALex from the National Center for Health Statistics. Project 1 uses a telephone survey to interview a cross-sectional sample of 2800 non-institutionalized adult U.S. residents aged 35-89. Persons aged 65 and older will be over-sampled to provide higher precision in older ages. African Americans are over-sampled for the first national survey of substantial size (n=1000) of this important sub-population. Project 1 data will be used to construct gender- and age-specific national reference averages for HRQOL among older adults on all measures. Project 2 will use all four measures to follow treatment and 6 month recovery of patients with three age-related diseases stressing different aspects of HRQOL newly referred congestive heart failure, hip replacement for osteoarthritis, and cataract extraction. This project will establish characteristics of the measures for longitudinal follow-up of patients with self-administered questionnaires. Project 3 examines how duration of a health condition affects HRQOL assessments and how this affects interpretation of HRQOL scores from standardized indexes. This is particularly important in the elderly as medical care increasingly prolongs life with chronic conditions. Project 4 determines survey mode effects (telephone versus self-administration) for all instruments as well as English versus Spanish language administration for persons who are usually Spanish speakers. The Program will enhance health researchers' ability to measure, follow, and interpret HRQOL in adults and to assess health disparities.

"CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This is a new application for Phase I of the Community Network Program (CNP) RFA.  The purpose is to propose an active and comprehensive community-based program to reduce disparities of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in metropolitan Detroit.  We propose to mobilize an intensive system of community-based participatory education, training, and research, given that data from our region demonstrate that older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of these cancers, are first diagnosed at later stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates.  The goal of our proposed CNP is to catalyze and sustain a strong community based movement to significantly improve access to and engagement of beneficial interventions to increase cancer screening and early stage detection, diagnosis and treatment.  This RFA affords a most important and unique opportunity for researchers and clinicians at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI), the Institute of Gerontology (IOG) and the Center for Urban and African American Health (CUAAH), all at Wayne State University, to combine our expertise and community contacts to create a vibrant and comprehensive community participatory education, training and behavioral research program.  We are located in downtown Detroit, and our collective mission is to serve the health and welfare needs of our minority constituencies living in our socially and economically challenged urban neighborhoods.  The aim for the first year is to create enduring partnerships among community leaders, researchers and medical professionals to facilitate and sustain education, research and training programs that reduce disparities; the aim of the second year is to develop community-based participatory research and training projects to promote secondary prevention behaviors including early detection, treatment seeking and routine surveillance; and the aim for years 3-5 is to implement, evaluate and sustain interventions and research to eradicate cancer health disparities         ",CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults,6923204,U01CA114583,"['cooperative study ', ' early diagnosis ', ' training aid ', ' neoplasm /cancer education ', ' community health service ', ' human subject ', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis ', ' colorectal neoplasm ', ' breast neoplasm ', ' prostate neoplasm ', ' lung neoplasm ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomics ', ' urban poverty area ', ' culture ', ' clinical research ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2005,499996,0.04106882067239808

The first four years of this study were spent developing a comprehensive set of survey items to measure religion in late life. This research culminated in a nationwide survey of older whites and older African Americans (Wave 1) that was completed in 2001. A total of 1,500 older adults were interviewed successfully for the nationwide survey. Analysis of the nationwide data suggests that the newly devised religion items have sound psychometric properties, and that these measures are related to health and psychological well being in theoretically meaningful ways. Funds are requested to conduct three more waves of interviews (Waves 2 - 4) with all subjects who participated in the baseline survey (Wave 1). These additional waves of data will be used to address the following specific aims: 1.) To explore the relationships among gender, religion, and health; 2.) To examine the interface between stressful life events, religion, and health; and 3.) To continue research on race differences in religion and health among older whites and older blacks.

The aims of this research are: to determine the incidence and progression of cataract in an older population-based sample of African Americans compared to Caucasians; to determine predictive factors and their relative importance for incidence and progression; and to determine factors predicting time to cataract surgery for those with visually disabling cataract in each racial group. Prospective data have already been collected as part of the NIA funded SEE project; baseline, 2, 6, and 8 year data are available from the 2520 participants on UV exposure, alcohol and tobacco use, medications, diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, and other key risk factors. Ocular photographs were taken at baseline and graded for presence and severity of cortical, nuclear, and posterior sub-capsular cataract, and taken but not yet graded for follow up visits. Vision and physical function measures were taken at each round, enabling analyses of functional impact of cataract and predictors of seeking cataract surgery. Models will be constructed to determine risk factors for cataract incidence and progression, testing for interactions by racial groups. Level of visual impairment due to cataract and effect on physical function within racial groups will be used to model triggers for subsequent cataract surgery. Such data will increase knowledge of cataractogenic mechanisms within racial groups, and provide more understanding of disparites in seeking cataract surgery. These data will advance the goal of reducing health disparity in visual disability from cataract among older African Americans.

"Community and Individual Predictors of Health Inequality A wealth of research has demonstrated that there are health disparities between Black and White Americans that are enduring over time and pervasive into almost all health domains. With few exceptions, differences in income, education level, and insurance status has narrowed, but not accounted for the entire health gap between Black and White older adults. One possible reason why these individual-level measurements have failed to explain the racial health gap is that many health outcomes are influenced by one's environment. However, to date, research has primarily considered only individual characteristics such as personal economic resources and has virtually ignored the relative impact of ""place"" on the racial health disparity. The intent of this proposed study is to systematically examine both individual and community influences on the health disparity between Black and White adults ages 65 and older. This research will examine community-level measures (measured at the Census tract level) that have been linked with the North Carolina Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE), which is a multi-stage sample of 4,162 Black and White older adults from five counties in North Carolina, and employ multi-level models to estimate the relative influence of individual- and community-level characteristics on the subsequent physical functioning of Black and White older adults. This proposed project is one of the first to integrate broader context into the study of individual health outcomes for the purposes of examining the racial health disparity between Black and White older adults.

"RELIGION, AGING, AND HEALTH    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this competing continuation application is to seek additional funds to continue work on the National Institute on Aging (NIA)-supported project: ""Religion, Aging, and Health"" (RO 1 AG14749). The first four years of this study were spent developing a comprehensive set of survey items to measure religion in late life. This research culminated in a nationwide survey of older whites and older African Americans (Wave 1) that was completed in 2001. A total of 1,500 older adults were interviewed successfully for the nationwide survey. Analysis of the nationwide data suggests that the newly devised religion items have sound psychometric properties, and that these measures are related to health and psychological well being in theoretically meaningful ways. Funds are requested to conduct three more waves of interviews (Waves 2 - 4) with all subjects who participated in the baseline survey (Wave 1). These additional waves of data will be used to address the following specific aims: 1.) To explore the relationships among gender, religion, and health; 2.) To examine the interface between stressful life events, religion, and health; and 3.) To continue research on race differences in religion and health among older whites and older blacks.  A wide range of state-of-the-art data analytic procedures will be used to empirically evaluate these issues.

"Center for Research/Nutrition & Health among the Elderly    (Revised Abstract) DESCRIPTION:  Puerto Rican older adults living in the U.S. mainland have been identified as a group highly at risk of excess chronic conditions, particularly diabetes, depression, and physical impairment. Few studies have been conducted on this rapidly growing and generally low-income ethnic group. To reduce health disparities, it is necessary to understand the factors that combine to progress to poor health outcomes. The overall aim of this Center is to perform a series of inter-related studies involving a cohort of older adults of Puerto Rican origin to evaluate specific stressors affecting the Puerto Rican community, and to determine the effect of these stressors on allostatic load and, in turn, on disease-specific outcomes. The Center will include four research projects. Project 1 is a prospective 2-year cohort study that will investigate both baseline and 2-year prospective associations between psychosocial stressors and allostatic load; and in turn, allostatic load and functional decline, specifically depression, cognitive decline and physical disability; along with the role of support, and vitamin intake and status in modifying these associations. Project 2 is a sociological investigation of psychosocial stressors and their measurement using both qualitative and quantitative methodology to gain contextual understanding of the sources of stress in this population that relate to allostatic load, and adapt instruments for its measurement. Project 3 consists of intervention studies. Using subsets of the baseline study, researchers will investigate the effectiveness of three different 2-year interventions in reducing indicators of allostatic load. Each is designed to be feasible for expansion by community agencies if effective. These include: 1) vitamin supplementation; 2) food coupons and nutrition education; and 3) social support and participation. Project 4 will investigate genetic contributions of allostatic load. Investigators will explore the relationship between selected gene variants and allostatic load at baseline and with change over time, and will investigate the interaction between gene variants and responses to the differing nutrition and social interventions. Three cores will work with all projects, including administrative, statistical, and laboratory cores. A pilot grants program during years 2 through 4 will encourage additional investigations relevant to the Center theme.

"Ethnic Variation in CAM Use and Health Self Management among Rural Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is widely used among older adults. However, overall levels of CAM use and specific modalities used among elders differ by ethnicity, gender and age. Neither the causes of ethnic differences in CAM use nor the effects of CAM use on ethnic differences in the health status or quality of life have been clearly identified. Few studies of CAM use are conceptually driven, and most do not explore the social or cultural factors related to CAM use. Studies have not examined specific CAM use behaviors; rather, they rely on self-reports of use in the past month or past year without trying to measure the actual frequency of CAM modality use or the predictors of specific CAM modality use. Population based studies of CAM use have not measured how specific CAM therapy use is related to health status or quality of life among older adults or minority group members. The overall goals of this project are to delineate ethnic differences in the CAM therapies used by rural elders and to determine ethnic differences in how these modalities are incorporated into health self-management. To attain these goals, this project will: (1) delineate the cognitive models of CAM among African American and white rural older adults that shape health self-management (components of these cognitive models include knowledge and beliefs about CAM modalities, information sources about CAM modalities, the purposes for which these modalities are used, the reasons for using these modalities, and how they are integrated into conventional health care); (2) determine the actual use of CAM modalities among African American and white rural elders; (3) delineate how the use of CAM modalities among African American and white elders affects the use of conventional medical care, and (4) determine the association of CAM modality use among African American and white rural elders with health-related quality of life. This research is structured by a conceptual framework that integrates concepts of health self-management with concepts from cognitive models of health. The design includes two components. First, in-depth interviews will be completed with 64 rural African American and white elders. Second, 6 times at monthly intervals structured interviews will be completed for 3 consecutive days with a sample of 200 rural African American and white elders. This project addresses health disparities by investigating why and how ethnic and racial minority populations use CAM. It reflects the recommendations of the lOM's Committee on the Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine by the American Public to use quantitative and qualitative methods to examine sociocultural dimensions of illness and health care- seeking processes and preferences, how well CAM users adhere to treatment guidelines, and how individuals evaluate information about CAM modalities.           ",Ethnic Variation in CAM Use and Health Self Management among Rural Older Adults,7128713,R01AT003635,"['health ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NCCIH,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,353133,0.08071237855885154
"CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This is a new application for Phase I of the Community Network Program (CNP) RFA.  The purpose is to propose an active and comprehensive community-based program to reduce disparities of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in metropolitan Detroit.  We propose to mobilize an intensive system of community-based participatory education, training, and research, given that data from our region demonstrate that older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of these cancers, are first diagnosed at later stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates.  The goal of our proposed CNP is to catalyze and sustain a strong community based movement to significantly improve access to and engagement of beneficial interventions to increase cancer screening and early stage detection, diagnosis and treatment.  This RFA affords a most important and unique opportunity for researchers and clinicians at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI), the Institute of Gerontology (IOG) and the Center for Urban and African American Health (CUAAH), all at Wayne State University, to combine our expertise and community contacts to create a vibrant and comprehensive community participatory education, training and behavioral research program.  We are located in downtown Detroit, and our collective mission is to serve the health and welfare needs of our minority constituencies living in our socially and economically challenged urban neighborhoods.  The aim for the first year is to create enduring partnerships among community leaders, researchers and medical professionals to facilitate and sustain education, research and training programs that reduce disparities; the aim of the second year is to develop community-based participatory research and training projects to promote secondary prevention behaviors including early detection, treatment seeking and routine surveillance; and the aim for years 3-5 is to implement, evaluate and sustain interventions and research to eradicate cancer health disparities         ",CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults,7065294,U01CA114583,"['cooperative study ', ' early diagnosis ', ' training aid ', ' neoplasm /cancer education ', ' community health service ', ' human subject ', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis ', ' colorectal neoplasm ', ' breast neoplasm ', ' prostate neoplasm ', ' lung neoplasm ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomics ', ' urban poverty area ', ' culture ', ' clinical research ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2006,487827,0.04106882067239808
"Cancer Control at the Intersection of Aging Research  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dr. Mandelblatt is a geriatrician with health services and epidemiology training.  She is currently Director of Cancer Control at Lombardi Cancer Center.  Dr. Mandelblatt has a long history of continuous peer-reviewed funding almost $31 million and centered on translational research for individuals 65 years and older (hereinafter referred to as ""elderly"" or ""older"").  Dr. Mandelblatt's focus on understanding and eliminating age and race disparities in cancer care miletus national priorities.  For instance, the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has recently renewed its ""war on cancer"" by declaring the elimination of age (and race) disparities as a key priority.  The National Cancer Institute Year 2010 goals echo this priority.  The importance of these national cancer control objectives is cast on the backdrop of the changing demographic profile of the US:  by the year 2030, one in five will be elderly and 40 percent will be from minority groups.  Despite this ""demographic imperative"" and rising cancer rates with advancing age, there is a shortage of researchers trained to address the needs of diverse older populations.  Dr. Mandelblatt is one a small cadre of scientists in the US with this expertise.  One important cancer care gap, recently identified by the Institute of Medicine, is under use of chemotherapy.  However, we know little about treatment decision making in regional breast cancer, where chemotherapy can have substantial benefits.  Moreover, there is a paucity of data on quality of life and clinical outcomes of therapy in older women.  Chemotherapy decision making is particularly complex for older women owing to limited age-related data on cancer biology, potential treatment toxicity, interactions of treatment and comorbidity, limitations in physical, social, and economic resources, and possible biases in care delivery.  The research and mentoring proposed in this application will address these issues.  The specific objectives proposed for this award are threefold:  (1) To conduct theory-based research on patient preferences and clinical characteristics affecting decisions about use of systemic non-hormonal chemotherapy in older women with regional breast cancer, (2) To develop a research database infrastructure to conduct new studies about potential race and age-related biases in care, and (3) To develop a training infrastructure to develop young investigators in population sciences, behavioral research, and cancer control for older individuals.  With this award, Dr. Mandelblatt will be able to continue her commitment to gero-oncology, have sufficient protected time to train new investigators in this nascent field, and address new research innovations to advance the science of cancer control at the intersection of aging.

"Norms and Performance Comparisons for 5 Health indexes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a Program of Projects to advance the applied science of evaluating health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older U.S. adults. We simultaneously use four widely-used generic HRQOL instruments, the SF-36v2, EuroQol EQ-5D, Quality of Well-being scale (QWB-SA), and Health Utilities Index (HUI2/3). Additionally we use the HALex from the National Center for Health Statistics. Project 1 uses a telephone survey to interview a cross-sectional sample of 2800 non-institutionalized adult U.S. residents aged 35-89. Persons aged 65 and older will be over-sampled to provide higher precision in older ages. African Americans are over-sampled for the first national survey of substantial size (n=1000) of this important sub-population. Project 1 data will be used to construct gender- and age-specific national reference averages for HRQOL among older adults on all measures. Project 2 will use all four measures to follow treatment and 6 month recovery of patients with three age-related diseases stressing different aspects of HRQOL newly referred congestive heart failure, hip replacement for osteoarthritis, and cataract extraction. This project will establish characteristics of the measures for longitudinal follow-up of patients with self-administered questionnaires. Project 3 examines how duration of a health condition affects HRQOL assessments and how this affects interpretation of HRQOL scores from standardized indexes. This is particularly important in the elderly as medical care increasingly prolongs life with chronic conditions. Project 4 determines survey mode effects (telephone versus self-administration) for all instruments as well as English versus Spanish language administration for persons who are usually Spanish speakers. The Program will enhance health researchers' ability to measure, follow, and interpret HRQOL in adults and to assess health disparities.

"Disparities in Mobility Device Use in Late-life    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technology is playing an increasingly important role in facilitating independence among older Americans. Despite evidence that minorities experience more disability throughout late life, the continuing debate on racial disparities in health care has not explicitly recognized technology as a type of care with which to be concerned. Research on the use of mobility devices among older adults has also not focused explicitly on racial disparities. The proposed research is a sociobehavioral analysis of secondary data that attempts to disentangle the effects of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health, and functioning on the use of mobility devices by older Americans. We propose expanding upon the Andersen behavioral framework (Andersen & Newman 1973), which has been widely used in the study of acute and long-term care utilization, to guide our investigation of two specific aims: 1) whether there are racial and ethnic differences in the use, adoption and abandonment of mobility devices and 2) the extent to which racial and ethnic differences in need (e.g., health, functioning and environmental barriers) and enabling factors (e.g., income, assets, insurance, and use of other health services) account for the these differences. Analyses will be based primarily on data from the NIA-funded Health and Retirement Study (MRS) which contains rich data on disability, device use, health, socioeconomic status, the use of personal care and environmental barriers. A series of regression models will examine the relationship between race and the use, adoption and abandonment of mobility devices and the effects that controlling for need and enabling factors have on the race-device use relationship. Based on these models, we apply a direct standardization technique to quantify the percentage of the observed racial gap in device use explained by racial differences in health and economic access factors.  The proposed research will lay the groundwork for future work on interventions related to enhancing independence for minorities experiencing functional decline in late-life. By examining both the adoption and abandonment of devices, this research will also provide insight into where in the disablement process interventions and policies might be most effective.         ",Disparities in Mobility Device Use in Late-life,7046321,R03AG026110,"['human old age (65+) ', ' assistive device /technology ', ' health care service utilization ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' travel ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF MED/DENT NJ-SCH OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R03,2006,69975,0.06486373029287167
"Culture and Mobility Device Use in Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Use of assistive devices for mobility such as canes, crutches and walkers, can reduce the risk of falling, promote activity, prevent disability and increase autonomy. Yet, despite these benefits, many older adults do not use mobility devices. Effective interventions that promote appropriate use of mobility devices are needed however at this time we are lacking research to guide the design of culturally appropriate interventions that would meet the needs of an ethnically diverse older population. The purpose of this study is to explore the influence of culture on attitudes and social norms regarding aging, mobility impairments and use of assistive devices for mobility. This qualitative study will use grounded theory techniques and employ a multiple case study design to study elders from the three population groups: Caucasian, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics. Data will be collected by formal in-depth individual interviews with key informants and focus groups of older adults recruited from among the Ocean State Senior Dining centers, and elderly housing facilities in Rhode Island. Focus groups will be stratified on the basis of participants' self-identified race/ethnicity and 3-4 mini focus groups of each racial/ethnic group will be conducted. Focus groups of Spanish speaking elders will be led by a Spanish speaking moderator. Coding and analyzing the data will begin with open coding, the identification of broad, descriptive themes, and continue with the development of more theoretical or analytical themes. Constant comparison techniques will be used to continually refine the analysis based upon incoming data. Sampling of comparative informants and focus group members will contribute to explicating the phenomenon under study. Data analysis will continue until no new information is obtained and no new categories re formed. The results of this pilot study are intended to inform a subsequent, larger, intervention study aimed at improving adoption of assistive devices for mobility. Findings from this pilot study will help us understand similarities and differences in minority and Caucasian populations' view of functional decline and assistive device use, and to identify culturally sensitive ways to make interventions more appropriate for diverse populations.             ",Culture and Mobility Device Use in Older Adults,7020661,R03AG025094,"['human old age (65+) ', ' aging ', ' assistive device /technology ', ' person with disability ', ' rehabilitation ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' health behavior ', ' attitude ', ' motivation ', ' social perception ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' culture ', ' functional ability ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2006,75679,0.07380228022725945
"Carolinas Conversations: A Multiethnic Digital Corpus of Speech for Older Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    To address health disparities related to communication with older people, the Carolinas Conversations (CC) will serve as a digital data collection with Web access for researchers interested in recordings of older people (65 years and older) of diverse social identities (gender, race, ethnicity, language, and socioeconomic status) throughout the Carolinas, historically underrepresented in health communication research. Aim 1: Establish the digital portal and corpus for research in health communication at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Library and related protocols for consent, access, security, search and retrieval; Aim 2: Collect and generate data for communication analyses of diverse racial, ethnic, and linguistic elders; Aim 3: Expand the capacity of researchers to use the Carolina Conversations Portal, broaden methods skills, evaluate utility and data safety, stimulate translational research, and disseminate results. Based on demonstrated archival methods and an informatics portal in the social sciences, this interactive archive will collect, prepare, and enable management and use of digital audio and video data in health research. For the archiving of data for secondary analysis as well as a source of original data collected with specific procedures for uniformity, the corpus will serve as a data repository (electronic portal) and resource for research orientation for the use of health and disease sub-collections. As a corpus ensuring consistent quality and compilation, the virtual site will offer spoken data to users from clinical, neurological, and social-behavioral paradigms. Prior to each recorded conversation, health literacy, health status, and cognitive function will identify participant condition. Using information technology, digital recordings and transcripts will be coordinated for retrieval and analysis of phenomena, such as word-finding pauses, content, syntactic cohesion, and referentiality. Online modules will show researchers how to organize, retrieve, and analyze transcripts by age, gender, ethnicity, time of day, and facilities. Privacy and confidentiality will be maintained for the persons recorded, using previously developed consent procedures and research access conventions.

"Computer Agents to Promote Walking in Older Adults with Low Health Literacy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  More than one-third of U.S. adults over 65 years of age have inadequate or marginal functional health literacy, and among indigent and minority patients in urban areas this number rises to over 80 percent. Face-to- face conversation with health providers remains one of the best methods for communicating health information to patients with low health literacy. The investigators have developed and successfully pilot tested a new computer agent technology for simulating face-to-face conversation with older adult patients in order to effect health education and behavior change in the area of physical activity promotion. In this research project the investigators will translate this pilot work into a computer system and protocol that can be readily deployed to ambulatory care settings, and will evaluate the efficacy of the resulting system as a mechanism to promote behavioral change among older adult patients with low health literacy in a two-arm randomized clinical trial. The intervention will be tailored for use primarily by an urban, African American, older adult population and evaluated in a similar study population. The computer agent intervention for walking promotion among older adults will occur in two-phases: (1) an intensive in-home, two-month, daily contact intervention deployed on a portable, touch-screen computer that patients carry home from the clinic, followed by (2) an occasional contact intervention via a kiosk-based computer that patients use when they come to their primary care clinic for an additional 10 months, to promote maintenance of walking behavior. The resulting intervention will be evaluated in a randomized study to assess its impact on walking behavior, fitness and mobility, and well-being in patients stratified by health literacy level, compared to a standard-of- care control condition. Older adults who begin an exercise program can reduce their risk of several chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, etc.) as well as depression, disability, falls and overall mortality. Low health literacy has been associated with limitations in instrumental activities of daily living, activities of daily living, and limitations in activity because of physical health. The proposed study will determine whether a low-cost automated system that can be easily deployed from ambulatory clinics will be effective in motivating older adults with low literacy to obtain more physical activity.           ",Computer Agents to Promote Walking in Older Adults with Low Health Literacy,7303303,R01AG028668,"['Cues ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' IADL ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' Population Research ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Behavioral ', ' Comprehension ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Gestures ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Indigent ', ' Interview ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Numbers ', ' literacy ', ' Loneliness ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' satisfaction ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Simulate ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Daily ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Condition ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Urban Population ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Upper arm ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' gaze ', ' experience ', ' caN protocol ', ' Population Study ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Walking ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' Information Technology ', ' touchscreen ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' Minority ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2007,639175,-0.008900935858021309
"Center for Research/Nutrition & Health among the Elderly Puerto Rican older adults living in the US mainland have been identified as a group highly at-risk of excess chronic conditions, particularly diabetes, depression, and physical impairment. Few studies have been conducted on this rapidly growing and generally low-income ethnic group. To reduce health disparities, it is necessary to understand the factors that combine to progress to poor health outcomes. The overall aim of the proposed Center is to perform a series of inter-related studies involving a cohort of older adults of Puerto Rican origin to evaluate specific stressors affecting the Puerto Rican community, and to determine the effect of these stressors on allostatic load and, in turn, on disease specific outcomes. The Center will include 5 research projects: Project 1: Prospective (2 y) cohort study. We will investigate both baseline and 2 year prospective associations between psychosocial stressors and allostatic load; and in turn, allostatic load and functional decline, specifically depression, cognitive decline and physical disability; along with the role of social support, and vitamin intake and status in modifying, these associations. Project 2: Sociological investigation ofpsychosocial stressors and their measurement. U_ _;,g both qualitative and quantitative methodology, we will gain contextual understanding of the sources of stress in this population that relate to aUostatic load, and will adapt instruments for its measurement. Project 3: Intervention studies. Using subsets of the baseline study, we will investigate the effectiveness of three different 2 y interventions in reducing indicators of allostatic load. Each is designed to be feasible for expansion by community agencies if effective. These include: 1) vitamin supplementation; 2) food coupons and nutrition education; and 3) social support and participation. Project 4: Investigation of genetic contributions to allostatic load. We will explore the relationship between selected gene variants and allostatic load, at baseline and with change over time; and will investigate the interaction between gene variants and responses to the differing nutrition and social interventions. Project 5: In-depth investigation of the mechanisms of inflammation. In a subset of the cohort that overlaps with those participating in interventions, we will assess detailed markers of inflammation and examine cellular response to acute stress. Three cores will work with all projects, including administrative, statistical and laboratory cores. A pilot grants program during years 2-4 will encourage additional investigations relevant to the Center theme.

"African American Families and End of Life Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given that health disparities exist throughout the lifecourse, it is not a surprise that end of life (EOL) disparities exist along racial lines. Research shows that African Americans are less likely than Whites to have formal and/or informal discussions regarding EOL care. However, they are more likely to discuss medical decisions and EOL preferences with family members than with health care providers, and also more likely to discuss EOL medical decisions and preferences with family members than to complete formal advance directives. Such EOL communication within the family can lead to improved outcomes, including closer alignment with the wishes of the dying individual, less conflict between the physician and family, and less burden on the family. Furthering knowledge of EOL communication within families of seriously ill older adults could identify areas for intervention that would lessen the current racial disparities in EOL outcomes. Yet, we know little about the extent and/or predictors of such communications. The purpose of the proposed study is establish the means to examine EOL communication within African American families who have a family member (60 years or older) with a serious illness. The specific aims are: 1) To test the feasibility of identifying and recruiting a primary and secondary family caregiver of 50 seriously ill older African Americans, and 2) To refine a semi-structured questionnaire and generate preliminary data on EOL content, style, and support for families of seriously ill older African Americans. Analyses of these preliminary data will examine relationships between characteristics of EOL communication (content, style, and support) and family members' evaluation of the communication (concerns and adequacy). To recruit family caregivers of seriously ill African Americans we will: (a) identify referral sources (community-based physicians, pastors, and funeral directors in North Carolina) who will contact seriously ill older adults; (b) obtain identifying information from the seriously ill adult for the two people who help him/her the most; and (c) recruit and interview the identified family caregivers. Data collected for Aim 2 will proceed in a sequential qualitative-quantitative mixed methods design. In the qualitative phase, caregivers of the first 16 seriously ill older adults (approximately 1/3 of entire sample) will participate in a semi-structured interview that will focus on open-ended questions. We will use the qualitative findings to develop a shorter and more quantitative questionnaire. The quantitative phase will consist of administering the new questionnaire to the caregivers of the other 34 seriously ill older adults (approximately 2/3 of the entire sample). This study will assist in developing recruitment strategies and measures for a larger, more in-depth study to learn ways in which communication can be improved so as to lessen unmet need and disparities in EOL care and outcomes.           ",African American Families and End of Life Disparities,7201965,R03AG024542,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Purpose ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Caring ', ' Family Physicians ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' Family ', ' Foxes ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Advance Directives ', ' advanced directive ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' improved ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prejudice ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hospice Care ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' End of Life Care ', ' Sampling ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R03,2007,59860,0.11491371404105208
"Norms and Performance Comparisons for 5 Health indexes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a Program of Projects to advance the applied science of evaluating health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older U.S. adults. We simultaneously use four widely-used generic HRQOL instruments, the SF-36v2, EuroQol EQ-5D, Quality of Well-being scale (QWB-SA), and Health Utilities Index (HUI2/3). Additionally we use the HALex from the National Center for Health Statistics. Project 1 uses a telephone survey to interview a cross-sectional sample of 2800 non-institutionalized adult U.S. residents aged 35-89. Persons aged 65 and older will be over-sampled to provide higher precision in older ages. African Americans are over-sampled for the first national survey of substantial size (n=1000) of this important sub-population. Project 1 data will be used to construct gender- and age-specific national reference averages for HRQOL among older adults on all measures. Project 2 will use all four measures to follow treatment and 6 month recovery of patients with three age-related diseases stressing different aspects of HRQOL newly referred congestive heart failure, hip replacement for osteoarthritis, and cataract extraction. This project will establish characteristics of the measures for longitudinal follow-up of patients with self-administered questionnaires. Project 3 examines how duration of a health condition affects HRQOL assessments and how this affects interpretation of HRQOL scores from standardized indexes. This is particularly important in the elderly as medical care increasingly prolongs life with chronic conditions. Project 4 determines survey mode effects (telephone versus self-administration) for all instruments as well as English versus Spanish language administration for persons who are usually Spanish speakers. The Program will enhance health researchers' ability to measure, follow, and interpret HRQOL in adults and to assess health disparities.

"Experience Corps Trial: Improving Health of Older Populations through Generativit With the number of older adults expected to double and the proportion of people 65 and older expected to rise to 22% by 2020, it is critical to develop and test population-based approaches for large scale, effective health promotion for our aging society. This will permit evidence-based decisions as to how to deploy resources in order to have optimal impact on the health of older adults. This Administrative Core supports the operations and overall coordination of a program project dedicated to contributing to this goal by conducting a randomized, controlled trial of the Experience Corps program and its cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit impact locally and societally. This program is a senior volunteer program which places people 60 and older in meaningful roles in public elementary schools, roles designed to have high impact on childrens' outcomes; the program attracts and retains older adults, 15 hours per week, for its opportunity to give back. However, designed into the program is a health promotion program, intending to increase social, cognitive and physical activity. This proposal will, in a University-community-city collaboration, conduct a rigorous evaluation of the impact of the scaled-up program through a randomized controlled evaluation: of older volunteers to determine whether Experience Corps prevents or slows physical disability, falls and cognitive decline (Project 1); of schools, to determine if children improve academically, behaviorally and in readiness to learn as a result of the social capital offered by Experience Corps and, hence, our aging society (Project 2); of the potential mechanisms of program action on brain structure and executive function (Project 3); of program effects on social and psychological mechanisms and outcomes (Project 4); and, finally, we will conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the program, taking impact on both older adults and children into account. The work of the 5 projects and 3 supporting cores will be mutually interconnected and synergistic, and will be interdigitated through a Steering Committee and an Executive Committee operated within this Administrative Core (Core A). This Core will project coordination and interdigitation, overall organization and budget management for all Projects and cores, monitor progress and effectiveness, produce reports, organize DSMB meetings, and coordinate community relations. Overall, this program project is designed to evaluate the utility and effectiveness of Experience Corps as a social model for health promotionfor an aging society.

This gap between our current pain-management knowledge and limited use of the therapies by older persons with CBP provides strong support for efforts designed to test and implement strategies that facilitate adoption among individuals adversely affected by CBP. Given that prior research has documented significant racial disparities with respect to pain management, targeting at-risk racial/ethnic minorities appears particularly warranted at this time. The investigators have developed an age-appropriate intervention - i.e., an integrated, cognitive- behavioral and exercise therapy (CBET) protocol - for the treatment of CBP among older adults, and now seek to partner with future stakeholders to conduct pre-implementation testing in a community-based setting. The specific aims of this project are to use a community-based participatory research approach to refine our intervention prior to implementation by: (1) surveying community partners (i.e., prospective consumers of the intervention and directors of senior centers where the program will be administered) about their readiness to adopt a self-management program for CBP and perceived barriers to program adoption; and by (2) field testing the intervention in senior centers that serve three specific racial/ethnic groups: Hispanic American, African American, and non-Hispanic White Americans. Products of this research will include a field-tested and modified protocol, as well as stakeholder informed strategies for future program implementation. The long-term aim of this work is to develop an effective and sustainable implementation strategy for the above intervention, targeting community-dwelling older persons. The multi-disciplinary investigative team assembled for this project consists of individuals with complementary expertise in the areas of geriatric medicine and pain management (Dr. M. Carrington Reid), sociology and measurement of behavioral phenomena (Dr. Elaine Wethington), and geriatric physical therapy and instructional development and evaluation (Dr. Katherine Beissner), and are highly qualified to conduct the planned research.           ",Implementing a Cognitive/Exercise Therapy for Back Pain in The Community Setting,7173221,R03NR010093,"['instrumental activity of daily living ', ' IADL ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Qualifying ', ' Range ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Expenditure ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adoption ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Inpatients ', ' Evaluation ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' disability ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Opioid ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity -

"CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This is a new application for Phase I of the Community Network Program (CNP) RFA.  The purpose is to propose an active and comprehensive community-based program to reduce disparities of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in metropolitan Detroit.  We propose to mobilize an intensive system of community-based participatory education, training, and research, given that data from our region demonstrate that older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of these cancers, are first diagnosed at later stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates.  The goal of our proposed CNP is to catalyze and sustain a strong community based movement to significantly improve access to and engagement of beneficial interventions to increase cancer screening and early stage detection, diagnosis and treatment.  This RFA affords a most important and unique opportunity for researchers and clinicians at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI), the Institute of Gerontology (IOG) and the Center for Urban and African American Health (CUAAH), all at Wayne State University, to combine our expertise and community contacts to create a vibrant and comprehensive community participatory education, training and behavioral research program.  We are located in downtown Detroit, and our collective mission is to serve the health and welfare needs of our minority constituencies living in our socially and economically challenged urban neighborhoods.  The aim for the first year is to create enduring partnerships among community leaders, researchers and medical professionals to facilitate and sustain education, research and training programs that reduce disparities; the aim of the second year is to develop community-based participatory research and training projects to promote secondary prevention behaviors including early detection, treatment seeking and routine surveillance; and the aim for years 3-5 is to implement, evaluate and sustain interventions and research to eradicate cancer health disparities         ",CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults,7264560,U01CA114583,"['health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' training project ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Improve Access ', ' Information Resources ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' Range ', ' Research Training ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Rate ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Heart ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Institutes ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentorship ', ' Michigan ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Peripheral Nerve Function Decline in an Aged Cohort    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although poor peripheral nerve function is common in older age, the rate of decline with aging is unknown. Diabetes and other known causes of neuropathy appear to account for very little of the loss of nerve function with advancing age. We conducted a cross-sectional epidemiologic study of the prevalence and risk factors or poor peripheral sensory and motor nerve function in the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) cohort. The Health ABC baseline cohort included 3075 men and women (42 percent African-American and 52 percent women). Of these, 1462 survivors aged 80-89 years of age are expected for their eleventh year follow- up exam. Longitudinal data from 2000-01 to 2007-08 will make it possible to determine whether nerve function declines are related to prospective lower extremity disability in 2008-10 and whether or not these associations are mediated by changes in muscle, bone density, and strength. We have documented cross- sectionally that peripheral nerve function is critical to their lower extremity function and mobility and is associated with muscle strength and bone density, demonstrating the importance of the peripheral nerves in sarcopenia and age-related disability. Analyses of numerous potential risk factors in Health ABC have revealed that age itself remains strongly related to poorer peripheral nerve function, even when accounting for established risk factors such as diabetes, and novel risk factors such as subclinical peripheral arterial disease and Caucasian race. To date, no U.S. study has reported the rate of decline in these aspects of peripheral nerve function with aging or has determined whether they precede lower extremity disability. The specific aims are to determine 1) declines in peripheral sensory and motor nerve function over six years and risk factors for these declines (demographic factors, vitamin B12 status, impaired glucose metabolism, subclinical peripheral arterial disease) in Caucasian and African-American older adults; and 2) if the rate of decline in peripheral sensory and motor nerve function is prospectively related to rate of recurrent falls and a decline in self-reported walking ability over two years. This study addresses many goals of the NIA, defined in its strategic plan, including prevention of disability, understanding age-related change and evaluating ethnic disparities. The Health ABC Study provides a unique and cost-effective opportunity to quantify and identify risk factors for decline in sensory and motor nerve function and relate these declines to prospective disability for the first time among a large group of older adults.              ",Peripheral Nerve Function Decline in an Aged Cohort,7322272,R01AG028050,"['Demographic Factors ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Impaired fasting glycaemia ', ' impaired fasting glucose ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Motor ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Hyperinsulinism ', ' Hyperinsulinemia ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' indexing ', ' Institutes ', ' disability ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' diabetic ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Muscle ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Nerve ', ' Neural Conduction ', ' Nerve Conduction ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Ankle ', ' Tarsus ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Peripheral Nerves ', ' peroneal nerve ', ' Fibular Nerve ', ' Physical Examination ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Prevalence Study ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vitamin B 12 ', ' vitamin B12 compound ', ' Vitamin B12 ', ' VIT B12 ', ' Cyanocobalamin (Vitatmin B12) ', ' Cyanocobalamin ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Neuropathy ', ' neuropathic ', ' Sensory ', ' Upper arm ', ' vibration ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' muscle strength ', ' Body Composition ', ' bone ', ' Bone Density ', ' Bone Mineral Density ', ' glucose metabolism ', ' cohort ', ' bone loss ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Peripheral Vascular Diseases ', ' peripheral blood vessel disorder ', ' Peripheral Vascular Disorder ', ' Peripheral Angiopathies ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Deterioration ', ' sarcopenia ', ' Accounting ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' cost ', ' bone strength ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2007,591528,0.014564766375385544
"Understanding Access to Hospice Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The hospice industry is expanding dramatically. The number of hospices has more than doubled from 1,600 in 1990 to over 3,600 in 2004. Despite this dramatic growth in hospice and increasing evidence of its benefits to patients with serious illness and their families, only 20% of older adults who die each year elect to receive hospice services. The availability of hospice nationally is an unstudied, yet potentially key factor in understanding hospice use. Studying the distribution of hospices nationally is also important for identifying the types of communities, in terms of racial and ethnic composition, income profile, degree of rurality and other factors, where gaps in the availability of hospice exist. A second critical aspect of understanding access to hospice is the types of services provided to patients and families that do access hospice. Recent evidence suggests that there is substantial variation across hospices in the care provided to patients and families; however, detailed assessments of such variability and the key processes of care used to deliver hospice services are lacking. Such information is instrumental to improving the quality of hospice care across the country. To address these issues, I will examine the availability of hospice nationally by estimating the percentage of older individuals in the U.S. that live too far from a hospice agency to have reasonable access to hospice services. I will use a novel technique involving the calculation of driving times between population centers and the nearest hospice agency to estimate the percentage of older individuals without reasonable access to hospice, and how this has changed over time. I will determine how availability of hospice varies by key characteristics of communities including demographic and socioeconomic factors. Last, I will conduct a qualitative study to develop a taxonomy of key processes of care used to deliver hospice services and generate hypotheses about potential predictors of variation in these key processes of care to be tested in a future study. Relevance to public health: This research will determine the percentage of older adults that live too far from a hospice agency to have reasonable access to hospice services. It will identify how availability hospice varies across communities that differ in terms of racial and ethnic composition, income, and degree of rurality. This information is critical for understanding disparities in use of hospice and for informing policies to increase the availability of hospice to patients with terminal illness and their families.           ",Understanding Access to Hospice Care,7248490,K99NR010495,"['Melissa ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Site Visit ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' beneficiary ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Incentives ', ' inducement ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Industry ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Policy Maker ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Terminally Ill ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' United States ', ' Adopted ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Bereavement ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Terminal Disease ', ' terminal decline ', ' Terminal Illness ', ' novel ', ' Censuses ', ' Certificate of Need ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hospice Care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Communities ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' care preference ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' volunteer ', ' ']",NINR,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K99,2007,89911,0.07830008256392051
"Experience Corps Trial: Improving Health of Older Populations through Generativit With the number of older adults expected to double and the proportion of people 65 and older expected to rise to 22% by 2020, it is critical to develop and test population-based approaches for large scale, effective health promotion for our aging society. This will permit evidence-based decisions as to how to deploy resources in order to have optimal impact on the health of older adults. This Administrative Core supports the operations and overall coordination of a program project dedicated to contributing to this goal by conducting a randomized, controlled trial of the Experience Corps program and its cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit impact locally and societally. This program is a senior volunteer program which places people 60 and older in meaningful roles in public elementary schools, roles designed to have high impact on childrens' outcomes; the program attracts and retains older adults, 15 hours per week, for its opportunity to give back. However, designed into the program is a health promotion program, intending to increase social, cognitive and physical activity. This proposal will, in a University-community-city collaboration, conduct a rigorous evaluation of the impact of the scaled-up program through a randomized controlled evaluation: of older volunteers to determine whether Experience Corps prevents or slows physical disability, falls and cognitive decline (Project 1); of schools, to determine if children improve academically, behaviorally and in readiness to learn as a result of the social capital offered by Experience Corps and, hence, our aging society (Project 2); of the potential mechanisms of program action on brain structure and executive function (Project 3); of program effects on social and psychological mechanisms and outcomes (Project 4); and, finally, we will conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the program, taking impact on both older adults and children into account. The work of the 5 projects and 3 supporting cores will be mutually interconnected and synergistic, and will be interdigitated through a Steering Committee and an Executive Committee operated within this Administrative Core (Core A). This Core will project coordination and interdigitation, overall organization and budget management for all Projects and cores, monitor progress and effectiveness, produce reports, organize DSMB meetings, and coordinate community relations.

"Ethnic Variation in CAM Use and Health Self Management among Rural Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is widely used among older adults. However, overall levels of CAM use and specific modalities used among elders differ by ethnicity, gender and age. Neither the causes of ethnic differences in CAM use nor the effects of CAM use on ethnic differences in the health status or quality of life have been clearly identified. Few studies of CAM use are conceptually driven, and most do not explore the social or cultural factors related to CAM use. Studies have not examined specific CAM use behaviors; rather, they rely on self-reports of use in the past month or past year without trying to measure the actual frequency of CAM modality use or the predictors of specific CAM modality use. Population based studies of CAM use have not measured how specific CAM therapy use is related to health status or quality of life among older adults or minority group members. The overall goals of this project are to delineate ethnic differences in the CAM therapies used by rural elders and to determine ethnic differences in how these modalities are incorporated into health self-management. To attain these goals, this project will: (1) delineate the cognitive models of CAM among African American and white rural older adults that shape health self-management (components of these cognitive models include knowledge and beliefs about CAM modalities, information sources about CAM modalities, the purposes for which these modalities are used, the reasons for using these modalities, and how they are integrated into conventional health care); (2) determine the actual use of CAM modalities among African American and white rural elders; (3) delineate how the use of CAM modalities among African American and white elders affects the use of conventional medical care, and (4) determine the association of CAM modality use among African American and white rural elders with health-related quality of life. This research is structured by a conceptual framework that integrates concepts of health self-management with concepts from cognitive models of health. The design includes two components. First, in-depth interviews will be completed with 64 rural African American and white elders. Second, 6 times at monthly intervals structured interviews will be completed for 3 consecutive days with a sample of 200 rural African American and white elders. This project addresses health disparities by investigating why and how ethnic and racial minority populations use CAM. It reflects the recommendations of the lOM's Committee on the Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine by the American Public to use quantitative and qualitative methods to examine sociocultural dimensions of illness and health care- seeking processes and preferences, how well CAM users adhere to treatment guidelines, and how individuals evaluate information about CAM modalities.           ",Ethnic Variation in CAM Use and Health Self Management among Rural Older Adults,7291655,R01AT003635,"['Complementary Medicine ', ' Complementary and alternative medicine ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ', ' NCCAM ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Guidelines ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' population survey ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Depth ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Home Remedy ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maintenance ', ' Minerals ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Daily ', ' Shapes ', ' grandparent ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Time ', ' Vitamins ', ' day ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Chiropractic (field) ', ' Chiropractic ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Rural Community ', ' Self Management ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Instruction ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ']",NCCIH,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,401863,0.08071237855885154
"PENN RCMAR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Schools of Medicine and Nursing of the University of Pennsylvania propose a new Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR): ""Reducing Health Disparities Across the Stages of Illness in Older Minority Populations with Chronic Disease."" The RCMAR will collaborate with community stakeholders through established research partnerships, and with internal and external institutions and programs that have an established track record of interdisciplinary, health disparities and aging research, and experience mentoring junior investigators and minority investigators. The proposed Center activities are contained in four cores: Administrative, Investigator Development, Community Liaison, and Measurement. The investigator core faculty are leaders in disparities and aging research in the clinical, social, behavioral, epidemiology, and health services fields. The Measurement Core faculty provide consultative expertise in an array of methodological issues pertinent to disparities research: data collection (qualitative and mixed methods) and instrument development, study design and sampling, secondary data analysis, and translation of evidence to communities through participatory research partnerships. The Community Liaison Core will advance the science of community engagement in research, inclusive of but not restricted to recruitment. The principal goals of the Penn RCMAR are to: 1) Conduct research across the stages of chronic illness with the aim of improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities in minority older adults. We aim to specify and evaluate diverse variables (individual, social, economic, health systems, family, and community) and their relationship to health care delivery (access and quality) and health outcomes across various stages of illness; 2) Design and test interventions at the patient, provider, organizational, and environmental levels that reduce health disparities in minority older adults; 3) Train and mentor diverse investigators to undertake health disparities research in these populations; 4) Prepare a wide range of community organizations and stakeholders to participate actively in the design and conduct of research and the dissemination of results. The RCMAR is characterized by an interdisciplinary senior faculty, and prominent minority leadership and participation. In year one, four pilots are proposed in the local community: 1) perceived future needs for transition to a nursing home, 2) spirituality in persons with hypertension, 3) exercise post breast cancer treatment, and 4) sleep perception and significance. Each project investigative team combines faculty from medicine and nursing, and combines a junior trainee and a senior faculty.           ",PENN RCMAR,7339943,P30AG031043,[''],NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2007,629994,0.010804696574618527
"CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults This is a new application for Phase I of the Community Network Program (CNP) RFA. The purpose is to propose an active and comprehensive community-based program to reduce disparities of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in metropolitan Detroit. We propose to mobilize an intensive system of community-based participatory education, training, and research, given that data from our region demonstrate that older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of these cancers, are first diagnosed at later stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates. The goal of our proposed CNP is to catalyze and sustain a strong community based movement to significantly improve access to and engagement of beneficial interventions to increase cancer screening and early stage detection, diagnosis and treatment. This RFA affords a most important and unique opportunity for researchers and clinicians at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI), the Institute of Gerontology (IOG) and the Center for Urban and African American Health (CUAAH), all at Wayne State University, to combine our expertise and community contacts to create a vibrant and comprehensive community participatory education, training and behavioral research program. We are located in downtown Detroit, and our collective mission is to serve the health and welfare needs of our minority constituencies living in our socially and economically challenged urban neighborhoods. The aim for the first year is to create enduring partnerships among community leaders, researchers and medical professionalsto facilitate and sustain education, research and training programs that reduce disparities; the aim of the second year is to develop community-based participatory research and training projects to promote secondary prevention behaviors including early detection, treatment seeking and routine surveillance; and the aim for years 3-5 is to implement, evaluate and sustain interventions and research to eradicate cancer health disparities.

"The Online Health Literacy of Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Internet holds great promise as a health information source for older Americans; however, little is known about older people's online health literacy. Online health literacy is the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information from the Internet. The main goal of the proposed research is to examine older people's online health literacy in terms of the strategies and success people have in finding accurate and useful online health information. The research's specific aims are: (1) Explore the strategies used by older adults to successfully navigate the Internet to answer typical health questions, where success is considered in terms of accuracy, perceived usefulness, and knowledge gained; (2) Assess whether older adults' online health literacy is related to gender, ethnicity, education, socio-economic status, experience with technology, and general health literacy; and (3) Compare online health literacy of older adults to that of younger adults and adolescents, determining if similar patterns exist across different age groups (where the groups are 16-21, 22-44, 45-64, and 65 and older). To address these aims, 500 participants will be recruited from the Baltimore-Washington D.C. and San Francisco regions. In media laboratories at Johns Hopkins or Stanford, participants will perform an activity where they try to find answers to open- and closed-ended health questions by searching the Internet. The research will employ innovative methods to monitor participants as they answer the questions, recording the websites visited, the applications run, and even what participants focused on when they looked at the computer screen. A subsample of 40 older adult participants will also use a talk-aloud procedure to allow the researchers to better know the participants' understanding, concerns and motivations while searching online. This research will improve our understanding of how older adults use the Internet as a health information source. The results can advance how individuals are trained to effectively use this medium, as well as inform the ways in which providers and other health care professionals communicate health messages through the Internet.           ",The Online Health Literacy of Older Adults,7303072,R01AG026430,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Deep South RCMAR will serve as research-based and mentoring investment in the process of closing the health disparities gap between African American and non-minority older adults. In addition, the Deep South RCMAR will increase the number of researchers with the capacity to conduct independent, peer-reviewed research related to minority aging and health disparities. The RCMAR will focus on health problems that are particularly prevalent among older African Americans, and will give special attention to issues related to rural elders; intervention research addressing exercise, diet, or preventive health strategies; and studies addressing socio-economic, discrimination, trust, and bioethical issues impacting both measures of both physical and mental health. The Deep South RCMAR will create research infrastructure for the following objectives: (1) establish a mechanism for mentoring research careers; (2) enhance cultural diversity of the professional workforce conducting research on the health of older persons; (3) conduct research on and disseminate strategies for recruiting and retaining African American older adults in research; (4) facilitate innovative strategies to support enduring research careers in minority health, and/or encourage the recruitment of established researchers to undertake research on minority aging health; (5) improve the research methods and tools necessary to conduct rigorous and comparable research on diverse populations; (6) advance scientific knowledge leading to a decrease in health disparities; and (7) disseminate to scientific and non-scientific communities research results addressing the resolution of health disparities through the improvement of minority health, particularly for older African Americans. The Deep South RCMAR will be composed of three interacting and collaborative cores (administration, investigator development, and community liaison) created by and built upon the unique strengths of four partnering institutions (Morehouse School of Medicine, Tuskegee University, University of Alabama, and University of Alabama at Birmingham). The cores will provide an infrastructure to provide training and mentoring programs, fund three pilot projects per year, and nurture community relations needed to meet the stated objectives.

"Anemia  and Its Relationship with Sarcopenia, Physical Function, and Mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anemia is a common health problem in US older populations; and it increases the risk for disability, decline in physical performance, low muscle strength, and premature death in the elderly. A recent study from NHANES III reported the prevalence of anemia being larger than 10% in the US population over age 65, and the prevalence of anemia varied by ethnicity, suggesting significant health disparities in minorities, especially in the African American population. In this study, a large (N >160,000) multiethnic (non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, African American, Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander) cohort from the nationwide Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study will be used to investigate the relationships of aging with anemia epidemiology, pathology and prognosis. Specifically, we will 1) evaluate the frequency of and risk factors for anemia overall and according to race-ethnicity and co-morbidity; 2) determine the association between anemia and risk of death over 10 years of follow-up in the WHI overall and by race-ethnicity; 3) determine associations between anemia and changes in physical function over 9 years of follow-up in the WHI cohort overall and by race- ethnicity; 4) examine associations of anemia with muscle loss (sarcopenia) among those with baseline and prospective measurements of body composition from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; and 5) study the association of anemia with bone loss and risk for osteoporotic fractures in older women. In addition, the frequency of anemia subtypes by morphologic categories and optimal cutoff points of hemoglobin concentrations for anemia in older women will be evaluated. This study will use archived observational and clinical trial data from 40 WHI clinical centers. Additional data entering for blood analysis from existing reports, and data merging (body composition measurements) will be conducted in the WHI DXA cohort from Arizona, Birmingham and Pittsburgh. Multivariate data analyses will be conducted for the specific aims. The WHI provides a unique and invaluable resource for answering the research questions proposed above, as the WHI is the only study in the nation that has prospective co-morbidities and body composition data as well as hemoglobin values in multiethnic groups of older women.

"Status, Inequality, Stress, & Health Among Older People DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for a three-year continuation of the study of ""Status Inequality, Stress, and Health among Older People,"" which investigates status-related stressors encountered across the life course and their effects on health and health inequalities. The sample, recruited from Medicare Eligibility Lists, is now 68 years and older. The proposed extension will add two interviews, conducted a year apart, to the three already conducted. It is expected that the additional interviews will reveal greater heterogeneity in health trajectories -- patterns of change and stability -- than can be achieved by the three interviews previously conducted over a two-year span. Thus, for example, it is anticipated that some elders will be observed to maintain uninterrupted good health, others continuous poor health, some will be seen to experience a sharp decline, and still others will display a mix of health decline and recovery. Concomitant with this greater heterogeneity is the expanded opportunity to identify the conditions that influence the course of health and well being of elders and to understand health disparities among groups of unequal statuses. Differences in exposure to stressors, past and present, and in the possession of social, personal, and material protective resources are considered to be among the conditions shaping health trajectories and contributing to health disparities.

"Quality of Life of Older Adult Long-Term Cancer Survivor DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests a five-year renewal of our project entitled ""The Quality of Life of Older Adult Long-term Cancer Survivors"" (R01-CA78975), originally funded as a five-year, longitudinal study.  The primary aim is to determine the long-term (5 or more years post-treatment) physiological, psychological, social, and spiritual effects of surviving cancer on older adults (age 60+).  This competing renewal responds to the NIA's (Yancik at al., 2001) and the NCI's (Meadows et al., 1998) reports that call for long-term follow-up of older cancer survivors.  A comprehensive cancer survivorship model focusing on quality of life (QOL) is framed in the stress and coping perspective.  Physical health QOL outcomes include health appraisal, physical and cognitive functioning, and disability burden.  Important aims are to distinguish the effects of cancer and its treatment from those of other co-morbid health problems and to document trajectories in health effects and their causes.  Psychological outcomes include psychological distress (e.g., anxiety and depression), PTSD symptoms, cancer-related health worries, life satisfaction, and post-traumatic growth.  Social outcomes include identity relevant characteristics such as self-esteem, body image, survivor identity, and the ability to maintain valued roles and activities.  Spiritual outcomes include religious and spiritual activities and life purpose.  The model includes ameliorative resources such as coping style, health beliefs, health promotion, and marshalling health care support.  The proposed renewal study will include 320 survivors who have been treated at the Ireland Cancer Center of University Hospitals Health System of Cleveland, an NIH Clinical Cancer Center.  The sample will continue to be stratified to include survivors of the most common survivable cancers among older adults, colorectal, prostate, and breast cancers, allowing for the examination of gender differences in the context of gender common and gender specific cancers.  African-Americans will continue to be over-sampled to provide the analytic power to identify racial differences in response to cancer.  In addition to three annual waves of interviews, event response interviews will document the effects of significant health/illness changes or personal/social losses that occur between annual interviews and identify the transitory/episodic effects of these changes.  Analysis will include multivariate analysis such as regression, structural equation modeling, and growth curve analysis.  Specific comparative analyses are planned with age, gender, racial, and cancer type subgroups.

"Factors Influencing the Health-Promotion Behaviors of Older Male Inmates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Between 1992 and 2001, the inmate population over 50 years of age in US prisons grew by 172%. This growing cohort of older prisoners commonly surfers from three or more chronic conditions and is estimated to cost taxpayers three times as much to house as do younger inmates. Additionally, many older inmates are eventually released back into the community, directly impacting that community's health. Despite recognition of the mounting financial, medical, humanitarian, and social challenges associated with aging inmates, relatively little has been done to enhance their health self-management; specifically, health promotion and disease prevention, hallmarks of health maintenance and cost containment. The proposed 2-phase prospective study will use survey and focus group (FG) methodologies to explore health management and health-promotion behaviors in older male inmates. A simple random sample of 192 male inmates age 50 and older incarcerated at two state prisons will be obtained for the survey phase and serve as the sampling frame for the FG phase, whereby 4-6 FGs of 5-7 participants each will be conducted to determine how some inmates are able to improve their health while in prison, yet others are not. Study aims are: 1) To confirm relationships between self-efficacy for health management and: health-promotion behaviors; health- monitoring behaviors; and self-rated health status in older male prisoners; 2) To examine variations in self- rated health status and self-efficacy for health management by inmate characteristics of older men in prison; and 3) To identify self-care strategies used by older male inmates to manage their health. Self-efficacy for health management will be measured using the Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scale. Health promotion behaviors will be assessed by the Health Promotion Activities of Older Adults Measure. Self-rated health status is a component of the Older Men's Health Program and Screening Inventory, which will be administered, as will a set of questions addressing health-monitoring behaviors, demographics, and items specific to incarcerated people. Aim one will be analyzed using correlations to evaluate the strength and direction of the relationships and aim two will be analyzed using general linear models. Focus group data will be analyzed using content and thematic analyses. Study findings will provide key knowledge needed to plan intervention protocols, where new or improved strategies for self-efficacy enhancement for this unique population can be developed and tested. The proposed research holds promise for: contributing to a more efficient inmate health system; decreasing the financial strain on the public treasury; paying dividends in the long-term health of our communities; improving nurses' knowledge of older inmates' health needs; expanding the analytic scope of the growing research literature on health in the general population to an understudied inmate population; and enhancing the nation's ability to meet the Healthy People 2010 goals.           ",Factors Influencing the Health-Promotion Behaviors of Older Male Inmates,7177140,R03AG029544,"['Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Housing ', ' Left ', ' Chronic ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' juvenile delinquent ', ' Young offender ', ' Juvenile Offender ', ' disability ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' Prisoner ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisons ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Behavior ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' parolee ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' offender ', ' criminal offender ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Today ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Biological Aging ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Deterioration ', ' Self Management ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' correctional system ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' older men ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' demographics ', ' ']",NIA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2007,59450,0.10225557887665003
"Disparities in Mobility Device Use in Late-life    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technology is playing an increasingly important role in facilitating independence among older Americans. Despite evidence that minorities experience more disability throughout late life, the continuing debate on racial disparities in health care has not explicitly recognized technology as a type of care with which to be concerned. Research on the use of mobility devices among older adults has also not focused explicitly on racial disparities. The proposed research is a sociobehavioral analysis of secondary data that attempts to disentangle the effects of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health, and functioning on the use of mobility devices by older Americans. We propose expanding upon the Andersen behavioral framework (Andersen & Newman 1973), which has been widely used in the study of acute and long-term care utilization, to guide our investigation of two specific aims: 1) whether there are racial and ethnic differences in the use, adoption and abandonment of mobility devices and 2) the extent to which racial and ethnic differences in need (e.g., health, functioning and environmental barriers) and enabling factors (e.g., income, assets, insurance, and use of other health services) account for the these differences. Analyses will be based primarily on data from the NIA-funded Health and Retirement Study (MRS) which contains rich data on disability, device use, health, socioeconomic status, the use of personal care and environmental barriers. A series of regression models will examine the relationship between race and the use, adoption and abandonment of mobility devices and the effects that controlling for need and enabling factors have on the race-device use relationship. Based on these models, we apply a direct standardization technique to quantify the percentage of the observed racial gap in device use explained by racial differences in health and economic access factors.  The proposed research will lay the groundwork for future work on interventions related to enhancing independence for minorities experiencing functional decline in late-life. By examining both the adoption and abandonment of devices, this research will also provide insight into where in the disablement process interventions and policies might be most effective.         ",Disparities in Mobility Device Use in Late-life,7191646,R03AG026110,"['Crutches ', ' Enabling Factors ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' beneficiary ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adoption ', ' Intention ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Numbers ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ', ' MRSI ', ' MR Spectroscopy ', ' Respondent ', ' Ownership ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Stigmata ', ' Standardization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Attitude ', ' Investigation ', ' Walkers ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' Work ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Beds ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Disease regression ', ' cane, includes canes of all materials, adjustable or fixed, with tip ', ' Walking Sticks ', ' Canes ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' Walking ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' time interval ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Accounting ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' improved functioning ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF MED/DENT NJ-SCH OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R03,2007,37748,0.06486373029287167
"Urban/Rural Disparities in Health and Mortality in China    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main aims of this project involve describing discrepancies in functional health and mortality across samples of older adults living in rural and urban areas of China and examining the extent to which these can be explained with reference to a combination of individual and community-level characteristics. Three secondary data sources are employed. The China Health and Nutrition Survey and the Sampling Survey on the Status of the Elderly in Urban and Rural China cover large geographic areas. The Beijing Multidimensional Longitudinal Study of Aging incorporates the city of Beijing and rural environs. Functional status and mortality is first examined using descriptive techniques and estimates of active life expectancy that adjust years of life and functionally healthy life in urban versus rural areas by age and sex. Urban/rural discrepancies in health are then further explored using a variety of methodological techniques, including nested multivariate and multilevel models that combine and interact individual and community characteristics. Individual and community-level characteristics considered fall under domains of social support or cohesion, socioeconomic status, behaviors and access to or availability of health services. Community-level socioeconomic effects capture factors related to economic and labor market conditions and community infrastructure. Given rapid population aging in the developing world, the subsequent increasing concentration of mortality and morbidity at older ages, and the urban/rural gaps in economic development that characterize many countries, comparisons of health and mortality across urban and rural areas are deserving of attention. Yet, the topic has received only moderate interest in the developing world, particularly among older populations.

"Organizational Variability and Racial Disparities in Hospice Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  My goal is to become an academic geriatrician focused on reducing disparities in end-of-life care. I have already initiated this career plan through completion of a Master of Health Sciences and research examining cultural attitudes and beliefs which may impact hospice use by older African Americans. With this award, I would acquire additional training in health disparities research. My research and career development plan will be overseen by mentors with research expertise in end-of-life care and content expertise related to the care of African Americans with life-limiting illness. Compared to Caucasians, African Americans are more likely to experience poor quality healthcare at the end of life. Also, studies document lower rates of hospice use among older African Americans. Because hospice is currently the most effective model for care at the end of life, increasing hospice use by older African Americans may reduce racial disparities in end-of-life care. To date, no research has evaluated the association between the organizational characteristics of hospices and disparities in their service to older African Americans and Caucasians. This research will test the hypothesis that racial disparities in hospice use are associated with variability in the structure, programs, and policies of individual hospice agencies. The specific aims are to: (1) Describe hospice-level variability in disparities in service to older African Americans and Caucasians; (2) Describe hospice-level variability in structure, programs, and policies which may influence hospice use by African Americans; (3) Identify organizational characteristics that facilitate the use of hospice by African Americans. This research will include: an analysis of Medicare Claims Data and a comprehensive database of the characteristics of hospices throughout North and South Carolina; and a survey and qualitative interview with hospice providers in the two states. The findings of this work will inform the development of organizational-level interventions to increase hospice use by older African Americans and eliminate racial disparities throughout the life course. Plain public health statement: Despite higher mortality rates from a number of chronic illnesses, African Americans use hospice services at lower rates that Caucasians. This research will determine which hospice programs and practices may increase the use of hospice by African Americans.           ",Organizational Variability and Racial Disparities in Hospice Use,7336864,K08AG028975,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Address ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Range ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Transfusion ', ' TRNSF ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Series ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' African ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Marketing ', ' Mentors ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Ownership ', ' Palliative Care ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' South Carolina ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' tube feeding ', ' Attitude ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Award ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' size ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Belief ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Services ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' health science research ', ' success ', ' Budgets ', ' Structure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' sensitivity training ', ' social ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Certification ', ' County ', ' Organizational Policy ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Police ', ' Hospice Care ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hospice Programs ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' End of Life Care ', ' Modeling ', ' outreach program ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' desire ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accreditation ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Population ', ' community organizations ', ' chemotherapy ', ' demographics ', ' ']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K08,2007,136408,0.08862907385418875
"Research and Mentorship in Improving Diabetes Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Dr. Marshall Chin's career goals are to perform research that improves the care and outcomes of particularly vulnerable patients with diabetes and to mentor trainees entering this research field. Translation of research findings from clinical trials is challenging. Thus, diabetes care in real-world settings is suboptimal. Indigent, minority patients who receive their care in community health centers are a vulnerable population at risk for poor outcomes. In addition, older persons who frequently are frail, have multiple comorbid conditions, and may have limited social support, are another high-risk group.  Dr. Chin's research program aims to: 1) Improve diabetes care and outcomes in community health centers by developing and implementing multifactorial interventions combining techniques from continuous quality improvement, chronic disease management, provider-patient communication training, and patient empowerment; 2) Improve care of older persons with diabetes by individualizing care and facilitating shared decision making between patient and provider; 3) Develop the Chicago Diabetes Mentoring Program in Patient-Oriented Research.  The candidate is Associate Professor of Medicine; Director, Diabetes Research and Training Center Prevention and Control Core; Associate Director, Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program, and Co-Director of General Internal Medicine Research at the University of Chicago. He has been funded to improve diabetes care and outcomes in community health centers, and study preferences of older persons with diabetes.

"Center for Research/Nutrition & Health among the Elderly    (Revised Abstract) DESCRIPTION:  Puerto Rican older adults living in the U.S. mainland have been identified as a group highly at risk of excess chronic conditions, particularly diabetes, depression, and physical impairment. Few studies have been conducted on this rapidly growing and generally low-income ethnic group. To reduce health disparities, it is necessary to understand the factors that combine to progress to poor health outcomes. The overall aim of this Center is to perform a series of inter-related studies involving a cohort of older adults of Puerto Rican origin to evaluate specific stressors affecting the Puerto Rican community, and to determine the effect of these stressors on allostatic load and, in turn, on disease-specific outcomes. The Center will include four research projects. Project 1 is a prospective 2-year cohort study that will investigate both baseline and 2-year prospective associations between psychosocial stressors and allostatic load; and in turn, allostatic load and functional decline, specifically depression, cognitive decline and physical disability; along with the role of support, and vitamin intake and status in modifying these associations. Project 2 is a sociological investigation of psychosocial stressors and their measurement using both qualitative and quantitative methodology to gain contextual understanding of the sources of stress in this population that relate to allostatic load, and adapt instruments for its measurement. Project 3 consists of intervention studies. Using subsets of the baseline study, researchers will investigate the effectiveness of three different 2-year interventions in reducing indicators of allostatic load. Each is designed to be feasible for expansion by community agencies if effective. These include: 1) vitamin supplementation; 2) food coupons and nutrition education; and 3) social support and participation. Project 4 will investigate genetic contributions of allostatic load. Investigators will explore the relationship between selected gene variants and allostatic load at baseline and with change over time, and will investigate the interaction between gene variants and responses to the differing nutrition and social interventions. Three cores will work with all projects, including administrative, statistical, and laboratory cores. A pilot grants program during years 2 through 4 will encourage additional investigations relevant to the Center theme.

"Norms for the Assessment Memory Impairment in Spanish Speaking Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research on cognitive impairment in Spanish speaking older adults has been constrained by the lack of appropriate methodologies for assessment and by the extremely limited availability of published cognitive assessment tests and norms for individuals residing in the U.S. This varies from the progress made in the assessment of other ethnic minority English speaking populations, such as African Americans, where ethnic specific cognitive norms have been collected and published. Hispanic, Spanish speakers present a unique challenge in that cognitive tests administered in English are inappropriate for use with monolingual and some bilingual Spanish speakers. The limited availability of appropriate assessment tools and strategies for Spanish speakers necessarily also limits the ability of clinicians to accurately diagnose memory and other cognitive impairment in this population, contributing to the health disparities between Hispanic and other populations in this country. The objective of the proposed research is to adapt into Spanish a commonly used clinical measure of memory functioning to establish preliminary norms which take into consideration key demographic variables that recent research has shown to influence test performance. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To establish a Spanish list learning test comparable to the published (English) CVLT II to assess learning and memory; 2) To analyze differences in performance on the Spanish test and the CVLT II versions in a group of healthy bilingual individuals and to compare performance of bilinguals with two groups of demographically matched monolingual individuals; 3) To determine whether traditional demographic variables of age, education, and gender will influence or modify performance on the two list learning tests and whether the variables will have a similar influence on a narrative memory test, and 4) To determine whether use of unique variables, such as percentage of time residing in the U.S., percentage of education in the U.S., language preference, and language proficiency, aid in predicting performance on the list learning tests and the narrative memory test, above that explained by traditional demographic variables typically used in the development of norms for clinical cognitive assessment tests. Spanish speaking older adults present a challenge to health care professionals who may misdiagnose individuals with memory impairment due to a lack of appropriate language tools and methods. This research will facilitate the development of appropriate measures to improve diagnosis and reduce health disparities between Hispanic and other populations in this country.          ",Norms for the Assessment Memory Impairment in Spanish Speaking Older Adults,7385446,R21AG028609,"['Vascular Dementia ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Cognitive ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aging ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Institutes ', ' Evaluation ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Individual ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Patients ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Aphasia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Aphasias ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Country ', ' preference ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' performance tests ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic encephalopathy ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' NCMHD ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2008,189420,0.0067228961312257324
"Organizational Variability and Racial Disparities in Hospice Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  My goal is to become an academic geriatrician focused on reducing disparities in end-of-life care. I have already initiated this career plan through completion of a Master of Health Sciences and research examining cultural attitudes and beliefs which may impact hospice use by older African Americans. With this award, I would acquire additional training in health disparities research. My research and career development plan will be overseen by mentors with research expertise in end-of-life care and content expertise related to the care of African Americans with life-limiting illness. Compared to Caucasians, African Americans are more likely to experience poor quality healthcare at the end of life. Also, studies document lower rates of hospice use among older African Americans. Because hospice is currently the most effective model for care at the end of life, increasing hospice use by older African Americans may reduce racial disparities in end-of-life care. To date, no research has evaluated the association between the organizational characteristics of hospices and disparities in their service to older African Americans and Caucasians. This research will test the hypothesis that racial disparities in hospice use are associated with variability in the structure, programs, and policies of individual hospice agencies. The specific aims are to: (1) Describe hospice-level variability in disparities in service to older African Americans and Caucasians; (2) Describe hospice-level variability in structure, programs, and policies which may influence hospice use by African Americans; (3) Identify organizational characteristics that facilitate the use of hospice by African Americans. This research will include: an analysis of Medicare Claims Data and a comprehensive database of the characteristics of hospices throughout North and South Carolina; and a survey and qualitative interview with hospice providers in the two states. The findings of this work will inform the development of organizational-level interventions to increase hospice use by older African Americans and eliminate racial disparities throughout the life course. Plain public health statement: Despite higher mortality rates from a number of chronic illnesses, African Americans use hospice services at lower rates that Caucasians.

"Linking Personality and SES Influences on Lifespan Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this K08 Mentored Career Development Award application, Ben Chapman, PhD, a psychologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC), proposes to integrate approaches from personality psychology and social epidemiology to study socioeconomically (SES) based health disparities across the latter part of life. Proposed are a comprehensive educational plan, original data collection, and secondary analyses of existing datasets designed to equip the applicant to become a leading investigator of how the social stratification in lifespan health trajectories is influenced by individual personality. He will receive formal training in social epidemiology, health and aging, and multilevel statistics through formal coursework and mentored didactics with a team of nationally recognized experts in these areas. Dr. Chapman's research program proposes two scientific aims, based on a synthesis of theory and findings from social epidemiology and personality and health, under a conceptual framework of life course epidemiology. The Aims examine the interaction between personality and SES factors influencing health behaviors and general illness burden across the second half of life. New data collection focuses on how personality influences health under conditions of socioeconomic deprivation, involving 18-24 month follow up of a pilot cohort (N=106) of ethnically diverse, lower SES middle age and older adults currently being accrued. This will provide Dr. Chapman with valuable experience following a small cohort over a short time, in preparation for larger studies, and obtain health data rare in existing data sources, like inflammatory biomarkers. Existing data sources are selected for longitudinal information on personality, SES, and health, permitting well-powered hypothesis tests over the Midlife Development in the US, Hawaii Culture and Health, and Older Adults in Primary Care studies. From a public health view, lifespan health is powerfully tied to social inequalities; but not all disadvantaged people suffer worse, and not all advantaged people enjoy better health as they age. Attention to individual psychological and behavioral dispositions can aid understanding of this heterogeneity. Blending personality and social epidemiology will better illuminate the interface between person and social structure in healthy aging.           ",Linking Personality and SES Influences on Lifespan Health,7531092,K08AG031328,"['Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Range ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Resolution ', ' Stratification ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fellowship ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aging ', ' Grant ', ' Half-Life ', ' Hand ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 (B cell stimulating factor 2) ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' Training ', ' Personality Traits ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Mentors ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Persons ', ' Personality ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Shapes ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Social Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Condition ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Adopted ', ' Attention ', ' Complex ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' size ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' social inequality ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' deprivation ', ' theories ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' healthy aging ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K08,2008,124634,0.022008744314536526
"Peripheral Nerve Function Decline in an Aged Cohort    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although poor peripheral nerve function is common in older age, the rate of decline with aging is unknown. Diabetes and other known causes of neuropathy appear to account for very little of the loss of nerve function with advancing age. We conducted a cross-sectional epidemiologic study of the prevalence and risk factors or poor peripheral sensory and motor nerve function in the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) cohort. The Health ABC baseline cohort included 3075 men and women (42 percent African-American and 52 percent women). Of these, 1462 survivors aged 80-89 years of age are expected for their eleventh year follow- up exam. Longitudinal data from 2000-01 to 2007-08 will make it possible to determine whether nerve function declines are related to prospective lower extremity disability in 2008-10 and whether or not these associations are mediated by changes in muscle, bone density, and strength. We have documented cross- sectionally that peripheral nerve function is critical to their lower extremity function and mobility and is associated with muscle strength and bone density, demonstrating the importance of the peripheral nerves in sarcopenia and age-related disability. Analyses of numerous potential risk factors in Health ABC have revealed that age itself remains strongly related to poorer peripheral nerve function, even when accounting for established risk factors such as diabetes, and novel risk factors such as subclinical peripheral arterial disease and Caucasian race. To date, no U.S. study has reported the rate of decline in these aspects of peripheral nerve function with aging or has determined whether they precede lower extremity disability. The specific aims are to determine 1) declines in peripheral sensory and motor nerve function over six years and risk factors for these declines (demographic factors, vitamin B12 status, impaired glucose metabolism, subclinical peripheral arterial disease) in Caucasian and African-American older adults; and 2) if the rate of decline in peripheral sensory and motor nerve function is prospectively related to rate of recurrent falls and a decline in self-reported walking ability over two years. This study addresses many goals of the NIA, defined in its strategic plan, including prevention of disability, understanding age-related change and evaluating ethnic disparities. The Health ABC Study provides a unique and cost-effective opportunity to quantify and identify risk factors for decline in sensory and motor nerve function and relate these declines to prospective disability for the first time among a large group of older adults.              ",Peripheral Nerve Function Decline in an Aged Cohort,7495100,R01AG028050,"['muscle strength ', ' Body Composition ', ' bone ', ' Bone Density ', ' Bone Mineral Density ', ' glucose metabolism ', ' cohort ', ' bone loss ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Peripheral Vascular Diseases ', ' peripheral blood vessel disorder ', ' Peripheral Vascular Disorder ', ' Peripheral Angiopathies ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Deterioration ', ' sarcopenia ', ' Accounting ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' cost ', ' bone strength ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Impaired fasting glycaemia ', ' impaired fasting glucose ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Motor ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Hyperinsulinism ', ' Hyperinsulinemia ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' indexing ', ' Institutes ', ' disability ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' diabetic ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Muscle ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Nerve ', ' Neural Conduction ', ' Nerve Conduction ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Ankle ', ' Tarsus ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Peripheral Nerves ', ' peroneal nerve ', ' Fibular Nerve ', ' Physical Examination ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Prevalence Study ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vitamin B 12 ', ' vitamin B12 compound ', ' Vitamin B12 ', ' VIT B12 ', ' Cyanocobalamin (Vitatmin B12) ', ' Cyanocobalamin ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Neuropathy ', ' neuropathic ', ' Sensory ', ' Upper arm ', ' vibration ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2008,568495,0.014564766375385544
"PENN RCMAR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Schools of Medicine and Nursing of the University of Pennsylvania propose a new Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR): ""Reducing Health Disparities Across the Stages of Illness in Older Minority Populations with Chronic Disease."" The RCMAR will collaborate with community stakeholders through established research partnerships, and with internal and external institutions and programs that have an established track record of interdisciplinary, health disparities and aging research, and experience mentoring junior investigators and minority investigators. The proposed Center activities are contained in four cores: Administrative, Investigator Development, Community Liaison, and Measurement. The investigator core faculty are leaders in disparities and aging research in the clinical, social, behavioral, epidemiology, and health services fields. The Measurement Core faculty provide consultative expertise in an array of methodological issues pertinent to disparities research: data collection (qualitative and mixed methods) and instrument development, study design and sampling, secondary data analysis, and translation of evidence to communities through participatory research partnerships. The Community Liaison Core will advance the science of community engagement in research, inclusive of but not restricted to recruitment. The principal goals of the Penn RCMAR are to: 1) Conduct research across the stages of chronic illness with the aim of improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities in minority older adults. We aim to specify and evaluate diverse variables (individual, social, economic, health systems, family, and community) and their relationship to health care delivery (access and quality) and health outcomes across various stages of illness; 2) Design and test interventions at the patient, provider, organizational, and environmental levels that reduce health disparities in minority older adults; 3) Train and mentor diverse investigators to undertake health disparities research in these populations; 4) Prepare a wide range of community organizations and stakeholders to participate actively in the design and conduct of research and the dissemination of results. The RCMAR is characterized by an interdisciplinary senior faculty, and prominent minority leadership and participation. In year one, four pilots are proposed in the local community: 1) perceived future needs for transition to a nursing home, 2) spirituality in persons with hypertension, 3) exercise post breast cancer treatment, and 4) sleep perception and significance. Each project investigative team combines faculty from medicine and nursing, and combines a junior trainee and a senior faculty.           ",PENN RCMAR,7502216,P30AG031043,[''],NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2008,782177,0.010804696574618527
"The Online Health Literacy of Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Internet holds great promise as a health information source for older Americans; however, little is known about older people's online health literacy. Online health literacy is the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information from the Internet. The main goal of the proposed research is to examine older people's online health literacy in terms of the strategies and success people have in finding accurate and useful online health information. The research's specific aims are: (1) Explore the strategies used by older adults to successfully navigate the Internet to answer typical health questions, where success is considered in terms of accuracy, perceived usefulness, and knowledge gained; (2) Assess whether older adults' online health literacy is related to gender, ethnicity, education, socio-economic status, experience with technology, and general health literacy; and (3) Compare online health literacy of older adults to that of younger adults and adolescents, determining if similar patterns exist across different age groups (where the groups are 16-21, 22-44, 45-64, and 65 and older). To address these aims, 500 participants will be recruited from the Baltimore-Washington D.C. and San Francisco regions. In media laboratories at Johns Hopkins or Stanford, participants will perform an activity where they try to find answers to open- and closed-ended health questions by searching the Internet. The research will employ innovative methods to monitor participants as they answer the questions, recording the websites visited, the applications run, and even what participants focused on when they looked at the computer screen. A subsample of 40 older adult participants will also use a talk-aloud procedure to allow the researchers to better know the participants' understanding, concerns and motivations while searching online. This research will improve our understanding of how older adults use the Internet as a health information source. The results can advance how individuals are trained to effectively use this medium, as well as inform the ways in which providers and other health care professionals communicate health messages through the Internet.           ",The Online Health Literacy of Older Adults,7494497,R01AG026430,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Social Inequalities in Outcomes for Treatment of Late-Life Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Late-life depression (LLD) is a major public health concern. It is associated with substantial impairment and disability in social and cognitive domains, increases risk for and exacerbates the severity of comorbid medical conditions [4-6], elevates risk for suicidality, and is a significant contributor to mortality. These associations and risks take on greater significance because LLD is commonly under-diagnosed and inadequately treated. Epidemiological research also suggests the presence of social inequalities in LLD. Socioeconomic status (SES), usually assessed by measures of education, income, wealth, occupation, and/or neighborhood characteristics, is associated with risk of depression in older adults (=60 years). Indeed, these risks appear to widen with age, with older adults of lower SES having markedly elevated risk for depression. Evidence is mixed about racial/ethnic inequalities. Whereas rates of LLD are higher among White males than among African-American and Hispanic males, older White males appear to have lower levels of depressive symptoms than older African American males. Furthermore, there is evidence that African Americans and Hispanics, in general, experience higher rates of chronic depression. The relationship between race/ethnicity and depression is itself, influenced by gender, income, and education. This application is for a small research grant (R03) to conduct secondary data analyses to investigate social and racial/ethnic inequalities in outcomes of antidepressant treatments in older adults. These analyses emerge from an initial study in which Cohen et al., (2006) reported SES (as measured by census tract median household income) was a significant moderator of antidepressant treatment in two clinical trials in which all subjects received high quality care. The proposed research will expand on this work by conducting an investigation of possible social inequalities in the effectiveness of PROSPECT (Prevention of Suicide in Primary Care Elderly: Collaborative Trial), a multi-site randomized clinical trial of an intervention (pharmacotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and case management) for the treatment of LLD. We will also investigate whether the relative effectiveness of the intervention depended social inequalities in positive changes in social support during treatment and/or the extent to which patients took advantage of various components of the intervention. The proposed research will benefit from its use of data from a randomized clinical trial that was conducted in ""real-world"" primary care settings and included a heterogeneous sample of depressed older adults, as well as the availability of multiple measures SES and race/ethnicity at the level of individuals and the neighborhoods in which they lived. Results of this research may yield insights about: 1) the social factors that influence the effectiveness of treatments, even when controlling for access and the quality of treatment; 2) the clinical and public health needs of population subgroups; and, 3) the need for methodological changes in future clinical trials. More generally, we expect this research will make an important contribution to our understanding of health disparities. Late-life depression is a major public health concern in that it is associated with increased risk for functional disability, suicidality, and mortality. Expanding on preliminary research, which suggested social inequalities in the effectiveness of antidepressant treatments, the proposed research will investigate social inequalities (as measured by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity) in the effectiveness of a primary care intervention for reducing depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and suicidality, and improving functional status in older adults. Results of this research may yield new insights about: 1) the social factors that influence the effectiveness of treatments, even when controlling for access and the quality of treatment; 2) the clinical and public health needs of population subgroups; and, 3) the need for methodological changes in future clinical trials.          ",Social Inequalities in Outcomes for Treatment of

"African American Families and End of Life Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given that health disparities exist throughout the lifecourse, it is not a surprise that end of life (EOL) disparities exist along racial lines. Research shows that African Americans are less likely than Whites to have formal and/or informal discussions regarding EOL care. However, they are more likely to discuss medical decisions and EOL preferences with family members than with health care providers, and also more likely to discuss EOL medical decisions and preferences with family members than to complete formal advance directives. Such EOL communication within the family can lead to improved outcomes, including closer alignment with the wishes of the dying individual, less conflict between the physician and family, and less burden on the family. Furthering knowledge of EOL communication within families of seriously ill older adults could identify areas for intervention that would lessen the current racial disparities in EOL outcomes. Yet, we know little about the extent and/or predictors of such communications. The purpose of the proposed study is establish the means to examine EOL communication within African American families who have a family member (60 years or older) with a serious illness. The specific aims are: 1) To test the feasibility of identifying and recruiting a primary and secondary family caregiver of 50 seriously ill older African Americans, and 2) To refine a semi-structured questionnaire and generate preliminary data on EOL content, style, and support for families of seriously ill older African Americans. Analyses of these preliminary data will examine relationships between characteristics of EOL communication (content, style, and support) and family members' evaluation of the communication (concerns and adequacy). To recruit family caregivers of seriously ill African Americans we will: (a) identify referral sources (community-based physicians, pastors, and funeral directors in North Carolina) who will contact seriously ill older adults; (b) obtain identifying information from the seriously ill adult for the two people who help him/her the most; and (c) recruit and interview the identified family caregivers. Data collected for Aim 2 will proceed in a sequential qualitative-quantitative mixed methods design. In the qualitative phase, caregivers of the first 16 seriously ill older adults (approximately 1/3 of entire sample) will participate in a semi-structured interview that will focus on open-ended questions. We will use the qualitative findings to develop a shorter and more quantitative questionnaire. The quantitative phase will consist of administering the new questionnaire to the caregivers of the other 34 seriously ill older adults (approximately 2/3 of the entire sample). This study will assist in developing recruitment strategies and measures for a larger, more in-depth study to learn ways in which communication can be improved so as to lessen unmet need and disparities in EOL care and outcomes.           ",African American Families and End of Life Disparities,7470582,R03AG024542,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Purpose ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Caring ', ' Family Physicians ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' Family ', ' Foxes ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Advance Directives ', ' advanced directive ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' improved ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prejudice ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hospice Care ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' End of Life Care ', ' Sampling ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R03,2008,58663,0.11491371404105208
"Implementing a Cognitive/Exercise Therapy for Back Pain in The Community Setting Among older persons, chronic back pain (CBP) is a common, morbid, and costly disorder. Non-drug therapies for CBP including cognitive-behavioral and exercise treatments can be feasibly performed by older adults with CBP, have proven efficacy, but are seldom used by affected individuals. This gap between our current pain-management knowledge and limited use of the therapies by older persons with CBP provides strong support for efforts designed to test and implement strategies that facilitate adoption among individuals adversely affected by CBP. Given that prior research has documented significant racial disparities with respect to pain management, targeting at-risk racial/ethnic minorities appears particularly warranted at this time. The investigators have developed an age-appropriate intervention - i.e.,an integrated, cognitive- behavioral and exercise therapy (CBET) protocol - for the treatment of CBP among older adults, and now seek to partner with future stakeholders to conduct pre-implementation testing in a community-based setting.  The specific aims of this project are to use a community-based participatory research approach to refine our intervention prior to implementation by: (1) surveying community partners (i.e., prospective consumers of the intervention and directors of senior centers where the program will be administered) about their readiness to adopt a self-management program for CBP and perceived barriers to program adoption; and by (2) field testing the intervention in senior centers that serve three specific racial/ethnic groups: Hispanic American, African American, and non-Hispanic White Americans. Products of this research will include a field-tested and modified protocol, as well as stakeholder informed strategies for future program implementation. The long-term aim of this work is to develop an effective and sustainable implementation strategy for the above intervention, targeting community-dwelling older persons.

"Cost-related Underuse of Medications and the Health of Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cost-related Medication Nonadherence and the Health of Older Adults Becky Briesacher, Ph.D., is a health services researcher and Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently-funded researcher supported by rich mentorship and fruitful collaborations in the area of aging and drug policy. Dr. Briesacher seeks a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) to gain: (1) a better understanding of cost-related medication nonadherence (CRN) and its effect on the health of older adults, and (2) research experience with models that account for irrationality in health behaviors. The candidate proposes a career development plan that provides new training in behavioral economics, targeted exposure to clinical geriatrics, and advanced statistical methods in longitudinal analyses. The research program includes: (1) creating a unique, longitudinal dataset from two national health surveys of older adults, (2) describing the longitudinal course of CRN, including identifying the predictors and potential consequences on patient health and health care expenditures, and (3) developing models of CRN in older adults that incorporate principles from behavioral economics, particularly time-inconsistency. The advanced training and three-part research program will provide the foundation for Dr. Briesacher's transition to an independent investigator in geriatric health services research. In addition, this research program will inform issues central to Medicare Part D prescription drug program and its effects on the health and financial stability of older adults. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Strong evidence shows that medication adherence decreases with higher cost-sharing, yet medication cost- sharing is rising, most notably in Medicare Part D. Discovering how optimal cost-sharing may improve medication adherence has significant implications for the health and welfare of an aging society that is increasingly dependent on medications.           ",Cost-related Underuse of Medications and the Health of Older Adults,7586883,K01AG031836,"['Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Social Welfare ', ' welfare ', ' Societies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Week ', ' Event ', ' Behavior ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Buffers ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Accounting ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Collaborations ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Exposure to ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Recommendation ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Older Population ', ' Monitor ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' beneficiary ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Age ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services for the Aged ', ' health services for seniors ', ' health services for older people ', ' health services for older adults ', ' Health Services for the Elderly ', ' Geriatric Health Services ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Incentives ', ' inducement ', ' Institutes ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Lipids ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K01,2008,124940,0.12098206629909745
"Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Deep South RCMAR will serve as research-based and mentoring investment in the process of closing the health disparities gap between African American and non-minority older adults. In addition, the Deep South RCMAR will increase the number of researchers with the capacity to conduct independent, peer-reviewed research related to minority aging and health disparities. The RCMAR will focus on health problems that are particularly prevalent among older African Americans, and will give special attention to issues related to rural elders; intervention research addressing exercise, diet, or preventive health strategies; and studies addressing socio-economic, discrimination, trust, and bioethical issues impacting both measures of both physical and mental health. The Deep South RCMAR will create research infrastructure for the following objectives: (1) establish a mechanism for mentoring research careers; (2) enhance cultural diversity of the professional workforce conducting research on the health of older persons; (3) conduct research on and disseminate strategies for recruiting and retaining African American older adults in research; (4) facilitate innovative strategies to support enduring research careers in minority health, and/or encourage the recruitment of established researchers to undertake research on minority aging health; (5) improve the research methods and tools necessary to conduct rigorous and comparable research on diverse populations; (6) advance scientific knowledge leading to a decrease in health disparities; and (7) disseminate to scientific and non-scientific communities research results addressing the resolution of health disparities through the improvement of minority health, particularly for older African Americans. The Deep South RCMAR will be composed of three interacting and collaborative cores (administration, investigator development, and community liaison) created by and built upon the unique strengths of four partnering institutions (Morehouse School of Medicine, Tuskegee University, University of Alabama, and University of Alabama at Birmingham). The cores will provide an infrastructure to provide training and mentoring programs, fund three pilot projects per year, and nurture community relations needed to meet the stated objectives. The Deep South RCMAR will ultimately become not only a regional, but also a national resource for expertise related to the mechanisms of health disparities between older African Americans and whites.           ",Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research,7687674,P30AG031054,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Institution ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resolution ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Process ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Alabama ', ' minority health ', ' Research Peer Review ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Investments ', ' Training ', ' Numbers ', ' Trust ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' tool ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Bioethical Issues ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' Community Relations ', ' Minority ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Deep South ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,P30,2008,127093,0.04750080542554918
"Factors Influencing the Health-Promotion Behaviors of Older Male Inmates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Between 1992 and 2001, the inmate population over 50 years of age in US prisons grew by 172%. This growing cohort of older prisoners commonly surfers from three or more chronic conditions and is estimated to cost taxpayers three times as much to house as do younger inmates. Additionally, many older inmates are eventually released back into the community, directly impacting that community's health. Despite recognition of the mounting financial, medical, humanitarian, and social challenges associated with aging inmates, relatively little has been done to enhance their health self-management; specifically, health promotion and disease prevention, hallmarks of health maintenance and cost containment. The proposed 2-phase prospective study will use survey and focus group (FG) methodologies to explore health management and health-promotion behaviors in older male inmates. A simple random sample of 192 male inmates age 50 and older incarcerated at two state prisons will be obtained for the survey phase and serve as the sampling frame for the FG phase, whereby 4-6 FGs of 5-7 participants each will be conducted to determine how some inmates are able to improve their health while in prison, yet others are not. Study aims are: 1) To confirm relationships between self-efficacy for health management and: health-promotion behaviors; health- monitoring behaviors; and self-rated health status in older male prisoners; 2) To examine variations in self- rated health status and self-efficacy for health management by inmate characteristics of older men in prison; and 3) To identify self-care strategies used by older male inmates to manage their health. Self-efficacy for health management will be measured using the Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scale. Health promotion behaviors will be assessed by the Health Promotion Activities of Older Adults Measure. Self-rated health status is a component of the Older Men's Health Program and Screening Inventory, which will be administered, as will a set of questions addressing health-monitoring behaviors, demographics, and items specific to incarcerated people. Aim one will be analyzed using correlations to evaluate the strength and direction of the relationships and aim two will be analyzed using general linear models. Focus group data will be analyzed using content and thematic analyses. Study findings will provide key knowledge needed to plan intervention protocols, where new or improved strategies for self-efficacy enhancement for this unique population can be developed and tested. The proposed research holds promise for: contributing to a more efficient inmate health system; decreasing the financial strain on the public treasury; paying dividends in the long-term health of our communities; improving nurses' knowledge of older inmates' health needs; expanding the analytic scope of the growing research literature on health in the general population to an understudied inmate population; and enhancing the nation's ability to meet the Healthy People 2010 goals.           ",Factors Influencing the Health-Promotion Behaviors of Older Male Inmates,7498460,R03AG029544,"['Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Housing ', ' Left ', ' Chronic ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' juvenile delinquent ', ' Young offender ', ' Juvenile Offender ', ' disability ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' Prisoner ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisons ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Behavior ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' parolee ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' offender ', ' criminal offender ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Today ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Biological Aging ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Deterioration ', ' Self Management ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' correctional system ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' older men ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' demographics ', ' ']",NIA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2008,58261,0.10225557887665003

"Computer Agents to Promote Walking in Older Adults with Low Health Literacy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  More than one-third of U.S. adults over 65 years of age have inadequate or marginal functional health literacy, and among indigent and minority patients in urban areas this number rises to over 80 percent. Face-to- face conversation with health providers remains one of the best methods for communicating health information to patients with low health literacy. The investigators have developed and successfully pilot tested a new computer agent technology for simulating face-to-face conversation with older adult patients in order to effect health education and behavior change in the area of physical activity promotion. In this research project the investigators will translate this pilot work into a computer system and protocol that can be readily deployed to ambulatory care settings, and will evaluate the efficacy of the resulting system as a mechanism to promote behavioral change among older adult patients with low health literacy in a two-arm randomized clinical trial. The intervention will be tailored for use primarily by an urban, African American, older adult population and evaluated in a similar study population. The computer agent intervention for walking promotion among older adults will occur in two-phases: (1) an intensive in-home, two-month, daily contact intervention deployed on a portable, touch-screen computer that patients carry home from the clinic, followed by (2) an occasional contact intervention via a kiosk-based computer that patients use when they come to their primary care clinic for an additional 10 months, to promote maintenance of walking behavior. The resulting intervention will be evaluated in a randomized study to assess its impact on walking behavior, fitness and mobility, and well-being in patients stratified by health literacy level, compared to a standard-of- care control condition. Older adults who begin an exercise program can reduce their risk of several chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, etc.) as well as depression, disability, falls and overall mortality. Low health literacy has been associated with limitations in instrumental activities of daily living, activities of daily living, and limitations in activity because of physical health.

"Understanding Access to Hospice Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The hospice industry is expanding dramatically. The number of hospices has more than doubled from 1,600 in 1990 to over 3,600 in 2004. Despite this dramatic growth in hospice and increasing evidence of its benefits to patients with serious illness and their families, only 20% of older adults who die each year elect to receive hospice services. The availability of hospice nationally is an unstudied, yet potentially key factor in understanding hospice use. Studying the distribution of hospices nationally is also important for identifying the types of communities, in terms of racial and ethnic composition, income profile, degree of rurality and other factors, where gaps in the availability of hospice exist. A second critical aspect of understanding access to hospice is the types of services provided to patients and families that do access hospice. Recent evidence suggests that there is substantial variation across hospices in the care provided to patients and families; however, detailed assessments of such variability and the key processes of care used to deliver hospice services are lacking. Such information is instrumental to improving the quality of hospice care across the country. To address these issues, I will examine the availability of hospice nationally by estimating the percentage of older individuals in the U.S. that live too far from a hospice agency to have reasonable access to hospice services. I will use a novel technique involving the calculation of driving times between population centers and the nearest hospice agency to estimate the percentage of older individuals without reasonable access to hospice, and how this has changed over time. I will determine how availability of hospice varies by key characteristics of communities including demographic and socioeconomic factors. Last, I will conduct a qualitative study to develop a taxonomy of key processes of care used to deliver hospice services and generate hypotheses about potential predictors of variation in these key processes of care to be tested in a future study. Relevance to public health: This research will determine the percentage of older adults that live too far from a hospice agency to have reasonable access to hospice services. It will identify how availability hospice varies across communities that differ in terms of racial and ethnic composition, income, and degree of rurality. This information is critical for understanding disparities in use of hospice and for informing policies to increase the availability of hospice to patients with terminal illness and their families.           ",Understanding Access to Hospice Care,7409636,K99NR010495,"['Location ', ' Country ', ' Bereavement ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Terminal Disease ', ' terminal decline ', ' Terminal Illness ', ' novel ', ' Censuses ', ' Certificate of Need ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hospice Care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Communities ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' care preference ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' volunteer ', ' Melissa ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Site Visit ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' beneficiary ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Incentives ', ' inducement ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Industry ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Policy Maker ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Terminally Ill ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' United States ', ' Adopted ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' ']",NINR,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K99,2008,88938,0.07830008256392051
"Racial Disparities in Heart Attack Recovery: Role of Stress and Stigma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), older African Americans tend to have significantly worse functional recovery and higher mortality rates than same-aged Whites. Race differences in older individuals' cardiovascular outcomes remain after adjusting for factors that traditionally have been used to explain this disparity, such as socioeconomic status and access to health care. Our overall goal is to examine whether this racial disparity in older individuals' AMI-recovery outcomes is partially explained by the combined influence of age stigma and race stigma, both of which can generate stress.       Based on our pilot data, the stigma literature, and Rutter's theory of cumulative risk, we will examine the following hypotheses for the first time: (1) African Americans and Whites with greater age stigma will have worse functional recovery; (2) Age stigma's deleterious influence on functional recovery will be greater among African Americans than Whites; (3) Among African Americans, (a) those with greater age stigma and race stigma will have worse functional recovery, and (b) age stigma and race stigma will act in a synergistic way to worsen functional recovery; and (4) Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction will mediate the process by which (a) age stigma impacts the functional recovery of African Americans and Whites, and (b) race stigma impacts the functional recovery of African Americans.       The secondary aim of the proposed study is to identify methods to help older persons recovering from an AMI cope with age stigma and race stigma. We will focus on coping strategies that may be amenable to future interventions.       Using a prospective, longitudinal design, our interdisciplinary team will assess 200 African Americans and 200 Whites, aged 50 and over, within a week of hospital admission following an AMI, and assess them again one month, four months, eight months, and twelve months later. Functional recovery will be assessed by physical performance over time. The mediator, ANS dysfunction, will be measured by 24-hour heart-rate variability and acute response to laboratory stressors. Secondary outcomes consist of depression, cognitive functioning, and adverse cardiovascular events. Relevant covariates will be included in analyses, such as age, AMI severity, and depression.       This study is responsive to PA-05-029,  Societal and Cultural Dimensions of Health,  because we will examine how the societal construct of stigma influences AMI recovery. Additionally, the study fits the NHLBI Strategy for Addressing Health Disparities which includes identifying psychosocial mechanisms that contribute to the progression of diseases that disproportionately affect minorities. The proposed research could illuminate an unexplored mechanism that enable stigmas to worsen health. In addition, it could lay the groundwork for future interventions to improve the AMI-recovery experience of older persons in general and African American older persons in particular.      Public Health Relevance: The worse recovery of older African Americans following a heart attack has been a persistent public-health problem. We expect to show how a previously unexplored psychological factor, in combination with a physical factor, contributes to the disparity between African American and White recovery. Further, our research could lay the groundwork for future cost-effective procedures to improve heart attack recovery of older persons in general and African American older persons in particular.          ",Racial Disparities in Heart Attack Recovery: Role of Stress and Stigma,7464360,R01HL089314,"['Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hospitals ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' racism ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Laboratory Finding ', ' Lab Findings ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Literature ', ' Ageism ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Exposure to ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stigmata ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Stress ', ' cognitive function ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Hour ', ' Week ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Belief ', ' psychosocial ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Glossary ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Data ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' ']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,803154,0.04286844078494607
"CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults This is a new application for Phase I of the Community Network Program (CNP) RFA. The purpose is to propose an active and comprehensive community-based program to reduce disparities of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in metropolitan Detroit. We propose to mobilize an intensive system of community-based participatory education, training, and research, given that data from our region demonstrate that older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of these cancers, are first diagnosed at later stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates. The goal of our proposed CNP is to catalyze and sustain a strong community based movement to significantly improve access to and engagement of beneficial interventions to increase cancer screening and early stage detection, diagnosis and treatment. This RFA affords a most important and unique opportunity for researchers and clinicians at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI), the Institute of Gerontology (IOG) and the Center for Urban and African American Health (CUAAH), all at Wayne State University, to combine our expertise and community contacts to create a vibrant and comprehensive community participatory education, training and behavioral research program. We are located in downtown Detroit, and our collective mission is to serve the health and welfare needs of our minority constituencies living in our socially and economically challenged urban neighborhoods. The aim for the first year is to create enduring partnerships among community leaders, researchers and medical professionalsto facilitate and sustain education, research and training programs that reduce disparities; the aim of the second year is to develop community-based participatory research and training projects to promote secondary prevention behaviors including early detection, treatment seeking and routine surveillance; and the aim for years 3-5 is to implement, evaluate and sustain interventions and research to eradicate cancer health disparities.

"Early and Mid-Life Social Determinants of Racial Disparities in Late-Life Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed study is to examine childhood and mid-life adulthood social determinants of health disparities between older blacks and whites. The study will assess racial disparities in late-life health in four biological outcomes: blood pressure, glycemic control, sub-clinical cerebrovascular disease, and inflammation. These outcomes were selected because of their relevance for racial disparities in health and the prevention of late-life disability and cognitive impairment. The study will focus on personal social resources (e.g., education, occupational status), and residential environment social conditions (e.g., birth county level of socio-economic status, neighborhood segregation during adulthood), and examine the degree to which these social resources and conditions experienced prior to older age account for racial disparities in late-life health. The study will also test whether racial disparities in late-life health ablood specimens in this population which are needed to obtain a measure of glycemic control. Despite general improvements in overall health among older adults in the US, racial disparities in late-life health continue to be large and pervasive. Racial differences in social resources and conditions in earlier stages of life are likely to be an important factor in alleviating these disparities. Findings from this study will provide a better understanding of the social and biological mechanisms that contribute to racial disparities in late-life health, creating a foundation for policies and strategies to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities between older blacks and whites.

"Social Inequalities in Outcomes for Treatment of Late-Life Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Late-life depression (LLD) is a major public health concern. It is associated with substantial impairment and disability in social and cognitive domains, increases risk for and exacerbates the severity of comorbid medical conditions [4-6], elevates risk for suicidality, and is a significant contributor to mortality. These associations and risks take on greater significance because LLD is commonly under-diagnosed and inadequately treated. Epidemiological research also suggests the presence of social inequalities in LLD. Socioeconomic status (SES), usually assessed by measures of education, income, wealth, occupation, and/or neighborhood characteristics, is associated with risk of depression in older adults (=60 years). Indeed, these risks appear to widen with age, with older adults of lower SES having markedly elevated risk for depression. Evidence is mixed about racial/ethnic inequalities. Whereas rates of LLD are higher among White males than among African-American and Hispanic males, older White males appear to have lower levels of depressive symptoms than older African American males. Furthermore, there is evidence that African Americans and Hispanics, in general, experience higher rates of chronic depression. The relationship between race/ethnicity and depression is itself, influenced by gender, income, and education. This application is for a small research grant (R03) to conduct secondary data analyses to investigate social and racial/ethnic inequalities in outcomes of antidepressant treatments in older adults. These analyses emerge from an initial study in which Cohen et al., (2006) reported SES (as measured by census tract median household income) was a significant moderator of antidepressant treatment in two clinical trials in which all subjects received high quality care. The proposed research will expand on this work by conducting an investigation of possible social inequalities in the effectiveness of PROSPECT (Prevention of Suicide in Primary Care Elderly: Collaborative Trial), a multi-site randomized clinical trial of an intervention (pharmacotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and case management) for the treatment of LLD. We will also investigate whether the relative effectiveness of the intervention depended social inequalities in positive changes in social support during treatment and/or the extent to which patients took advantage of various components of the intervention. The proposed research will benefit from its use of data from a randomized clinical trial that was conducted in ""real-world"" primary care settings and included a heterogeneous sample of depressed older adults, as well as the availability of multiple measures SES and race/ethnicity at the level of individuals and the neighborhoods in which they lived. Results of this research may yield insights about: 1) the social factors that influence the effectiveness of treatments, even when controlling for access and the quality of treatment; 2) the clinical and public health needs of population subgroups; and, 3) the need for methodological changes in future clinical trials. More generally, we expect this research will make an important contribution to our understanding of health disparities. Late-life depression is a major public health concern in that it is associated with increased risk for functional disability, suicidality, and mortality. Expanding on preliminary research, which suggested social inequalities in the effectiveness of antidepressant treatments, the proposed research will investigate social inequalities (as measured by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity) in the effectiveness of a primary care intervention for reducing depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and suicidality, and improving functional status in older adults. Results of this research may yield new insights about: 1) the social factors that influence the effectiveness of treatments, even when controlling for access and the quality of treatment; 2) the clinical and public health needs of population subgroups; and, 3) the need for methodological changes in future clinical trials.          ",Social Inequalities in Outcomes for Treatment of Late-Life Depression,7696665,R03MH083335,"['social inequality ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R03,2008,50637,0.001073934563176627
"Anemia  and Its Relationship with Sarcopenia, Physical Function, and Mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anemia is a common health problem in US older populations; and it increases the risk for disability, decline in physical performance, low muscle strength, and premature death in the elderly. A recent study from NHANES III reported the prevalence of anemia being larger than 10% in the US population over age 65, and the prevalence of anemia varied by ethnicity, suggesting significant health disparities in minorities, especially in the African American population. In this study, a large (N >160,000) multiethnic (non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, African American, Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander) cohort from the nationwide Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study will be used to investigate the relationships of aging with anemia epidemiology, pathology and prognosis. Specifically, we will 1) evaluate the frequency of and risk factors for anemia overall and according to race-ethnicity and co-morbidity; 2) determine the association between anemia and risk of death over 10 years of follow-up in the WHI overall and by race-ethnicity; 3) determine associations between anemia and changes in physical function over 9 years of follow-up in the WHI cohort overall and by race- ethnicity; 4) examine associations of anemia with muscle loss (sarcopenia) among those with baseline and prospective measurements of body composition from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; and 5) study the association of anemia with bone loss and risk for osteoporotic fractures in older women. In addition, the frequency of anemia subtypes by morphologic categories and optimal cutoff points of hemoglobin concentrations for anemia in older women will be evaluated. This study will use archived observational and clinical trial data from 40 WHI clinical centers. Additional data entering for blood analysis from existing reports, and data merging (body composition measurements) will be conducted in the WHI DXA cohort from Arizona, Birmingham and Pittsburgh. Multivariate data analyses will be conducted for the specific aims. The WHI provides a unique and invaluable resource for answering the research questions proposed above, as the WHI is the only study in the nation that has prospective co-morbidities and body composition data as well as hemoglobin values in multiethnic groups of older women.

"Urban/Rural Disparities in Health and Mortality in China    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main aims of this project involve describing discrepancies in functional health and mortality across samples of older adults living in rural and urban areas of China and examining the extent to which these can be explained with reference to a combination of individual and community-level characteristics. Three secondary data sources are employed. The China Health and Nutrition Survey and the Sampling Survey on the Status of the Elderly in Urban and Rural China cover large geographic areas. The Beijing Multidimensional Longitudinal Study of Aging incorporates the city of Beijing and rural environs. Functional status and mortality is first examined using descriptive techniques and estimates of active life expectancy that adjust years of life and functionally healthy life in urban versus rural areas by age and sex. Urban/rural discrepancies in health are then further explored using a variety of methodological techniques, including nested multivariate and multilevel models that combine and interact individual and community characteristics. Individual and community-level characteristics considered fall under domains of social support or cohesion, socioeconomic status, behaviors and access to or availability of health services. Community-level socioeconomic effects capture factors related to economic and labor market conditions and community infrastructure. Given rapid population aging in the developing world, the subsequent increasing concentration of mortality and morbidity at older ages, and the urban/rural gaps in economic development that characterize many countries, comparisons of health and mortality across urban and rural areas are deserving of attention. Yet, the topic has received only moderate interest in the developing world, particularly among older populations. This program of research is anticipated to fill that gap for China.              ",Urban/Rural Disparities in Health and Mortality in China,7407995,R03AG025729,"['Data Sources ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' degenerative disease ', ' degenerative condition ', ' Economic Development ', ' Economical Development ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Older Population ', ' Seminal ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' density ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Government ', ' Aging ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Area ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Investments ', ' Labor Forces ', ' Labor Migrations ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Marketing ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' news ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Adjusted Life Years ', ' Nutrition Surveys ', ' nutritional survey ', ' Population Sizes ', ' Private Sector ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Rural Health ', ' Social Development ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Societies ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Life ', ' Health Transition ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' functional status ', ' metropolitan ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' County ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' China ', ' Mainland China ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' Cities ', ' Accounting ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communities ', ' health economics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' rural disparities ', ' Population ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2008,67830,0.010437264231768535
"Costa Rican Health and Retirement Survey    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application proposes to field two waves of a new, nationally representative longitudinal Costa Rican Health and Retirement Survey targeting Costa Rican adults near retirement age, born 1945-1955. This would complement an on-going longitudinal household survey of older Costa Ricans born before 1945 (CRELES). A number of factors make Costa Rica an important site for the study of older adults' health and economic status: (a) Costa Rica has higher life expectancy than even the United States, with lower age-specific mortality rates among adults. The proposed data would allow unique new insight into life-course social and economic determinants of Costa Rica's success, as well as investigation of the bi-directional relationships between health and work among older adults in this exemplar population. (b) Past work has found Costa Rica to have unusually small socioeconomic gradients in health and economic well-being. This project is designed to allow deeper exploration of the role of public and private support underlying these remarkable inequality patterns. (c) Costa Rica experienced one of the earliest and fastest fertility transitions in the developing world, with total fertility dropping from 7.3 births in 1960 to 3.7 by 1976. By focusing on the parental cohorts experiencing this decline, this survey can uniquely advance understanding of the long- term demographic dividends of fertility decline. (d) Costa Rica provides a particularly rich study setting due to the ability to retrospectively and prospectively link the proposed microdata with high quality registries of vital events such as deaths, creating the ability to follow the sampled cohort at low cost indefinitely into the future. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed project would generate a unique new dataset for studying the determinants of longevity in a country considered a success story for having achieved ""good health at low cost."" Furthermore, it would enable detailed study of social and economic conditions surrounding retirement in a country on the leading edge of the aging transition in Latin America.             ",Costa Rican Health and Retirement Survey,7528287,R01AG031716,"['Costa Rica ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Social Network ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Range ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Fertility ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Hemoglobin C ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Household ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Depth ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Labor Forces ', ' Latin America ', ' insight ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Costa Rican ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mexican ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Reliance ', ' Pensions ', ' Retirement Benefits ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Condition ', ' Registries ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Social Welfare ', ' welfare ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' United States ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' Salivary ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' social model ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' expectation ', ' social ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Accounting ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' Intergenerational transfer ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,381768,0.04997437097730339
"Psychological Well Being and Recovery Among Older Hospitalized Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposed study addresses the Program Announcement entitled ""Research on Mind-Body Interactions and Health"" (PA-07-046). Specifically, we address the National Institute on Aging (NIA) interest in exploring associations between psychological well-being and functional ability in older adults hospitalized for acute illness. The Specific Aims of the proposed application are to: 1. Examine change in functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. Functional status will be assessed by a battery of measures (a 4 meter walk, a test of grip strength, knee extensor strength and seven activities of daily living (ADLs)) at 5 time points: within 24 hours of hospital admission and discharge, and 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge. 2. Examine direct and indirect associations between psychological well-being and functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. Psychological well-being, assessed by a 6- domain psychological well-being instrument and a positive affect summary scale, will be used to examine patterns of association with functional status over the 5 time points outlined in aim 1. 3. Examine whether psychological well-being modifies ethnic health disparities associated with functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. This aim will allow us to examine how ethnic group (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics) interacts with psychological well-being to influence functional status over the 5 time points outlined in aim 1. To explore our aims, we plan to follow up an ethnically diverse sample of 800 older patients (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics) admitted to the Acute Care for Elders (ACE) unit at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Older adults enrolled in the study will be assessed at five time points: within 24 hours of hospital admission, within 24 hours of hospital discharge and 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge. The five time points will allow us not only to examine overall patterns of effect between functional status and psychological well-being but it will also allow us to examine patterns of effect over distinct time periods including hospitalization and post discharge. The three post discharge follow up interviews will further allow us to examine and explain associations between functional status and psychological well-being in relation to short (1 month) and longer term (6 and 12 month) recovery patterns. A central goal of the current application is to examine whether psychological well-being can influence the risk for functional status decline associated with hospitalization in an ethnically diverse older patient population.          ",Psychological Well Being and Recovery Among Older Hospitalized Adults,7525620,R01AG031178,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Knee ', ' Recovery ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Patients ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Mind-Body Relationship (Physiology) ', ' mind body interaction ', ' brain-body interaction ', ' Relations, Mind-Body (Physiology) ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Well in self ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Mental well-being ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' meter ', ' interest ', ' functional status ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' body-mind ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Sampling ', ' Communities ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R01,2008,309550,0.05681933364459836
"Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Deep South RCMAR will serve as research-based and mentoring investment in the process of closing the health disparities gap between African American and non-minority older adults. In addition, the Deep South RCMAR will increase the number of researchers with the capacity to conduct independent, peer-reviewed research related to minority aging and health disparities. The RCMAR will focus on health problems that are particularly prevalent among older African Americans, and will give special attention to issues related to rural elders; intervention research addressing exercise, diet, or preventive health strategies; and studies addressing socio-economic, discrimination, trust, and bioethical issues impacting both measures of both physical and mental health. The Deep South RCMAR will create research infrastructure for the following objectives: (1) establish a mechanism for mentoring research careers; (2) enhance cultural diversity of the professional workforce conducting research on the health of older persons; (3) conduct research on and disseminate strategies for recruiting and retaining African American older adults in research; (4) facilitate innovative strategies to support enduring research careers in minority health, and/or encourage the recruitment of established researchers to undertake research on minority aging health; (5) improve the research methods and tools necessary to conduct rigorous and comparable research on diverse populations; (6) advance scientific knowledge leading to a decrease in health disparities; and (7) disseminate to scientific and non-scientific communities research results addressing the resolution of health disparities through the improvement of minority health, particularly for older African Americans. The Deep South RCMAR will be composed of three interacting and collaborative cores (administration, investigator development, and community liaison) created by and built upon the unique strengths of four partnering institutions (Morehouse School of Medicine, Tuskegee University, University of Alabama, and University of Alabama at Birmingham). The cores will provide an infrastructure to provide training and mentoring programs, fund three pilot projects per year, and nurture community relations needed to meet the stated objectives. The Deep South RCMAR will ultimately become not only a regional, but also a national resource for expertise related to the mechanisms of health disparities between older African Americans and whites.           ",Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research,7502198,P30AG031054,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Institution ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resolution ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Process ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Alabama ', ' minority health ', ' Research Peer Review ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Investments ', ' Training ', ' Numbers ', ' Trust ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' tool ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Bioethical Issues ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' Community Relations ', ' Minority ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Deep South ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,P30,2008,931092,0.04750080542554918
"Ethnic Variation in CAM Use and Health Self Management among Rural Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is widely used among older adults. However, overall levels of CAM use and specific modalities used among elders differ by ethnicity, gender and age. Neither the causes of ethnic differences in CAM use nor the effects of CAM use on ethnic differences in the health status or quality of life have been clearly identified. Few studies of CAM use are conceptually driven, and most do not explore the social or cultural factors related to CAM use. Studies have not examined specific CAM use behaviors; rather, they rely on self-reports of use in the past month or past year without trying to measure the actual frequency of CAM modality use or the predictors of specific CAM modality use. Population based studies of CAM use have not measured how specific CAM therapy use is related to health status or quality of life among older adults or minority group members. The overall goals of this project are to delineate ethnic differences in the CAM therapies used by rural elders and to determine ethnic differences in how these modalities are incorporated into health self-management. To attain these goals, this project will: (1) delineate the cognitive models of CAM among African American and white rural older adults that shape health self-management (components of these cognitive models include knowledge and beliefs about CAM modalities, information sources about CAM modalities, the purposes for which these modalities are used, the reasons for using these modalities, and how they are integrated into conventional health care); (2) determine the actual use of CAM modalities among African American and white rural elders; (3) delineate how the use of CAM modalities among African American and white elders affects the use of conventional medical care, and (4) determine the association of CAM modality use among African American and white rural elders with health-related quality of life. This research is structured by a conceptual framework that integrates concepts of health self-management with concepts from cognitive models of health. The design includes two components. First, in-depth interviews will be completed with 64 rural African American and white elders. Second, 6 times at monthly intervals structured interviews will be completed for 3 consecutive days with a sample of 200 rural African American and white elders. This project addresses health disparities by investigating why and how ethnic and racial minority populations use CAM. It reflects the recommendations of the lOM's Committee on the Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine by the American Public to use quantitative and qualitative methods to examine sociocultural dimensions of illness and health care- seeking processes and preferences, how well CAM users adhere to treatment guidelines, and how individuals evaluate information about CAM modalities.           ",Ethnic Variation in CAM Use and Health Self Management among Rural Older Adults,7471516,R01AT003635,"['Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maintenance ', ' Minerals ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Daily ', ' Shapes ', ' grandparent ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Time ', ' Vitamins ', ' day ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Chiropractic (field) ', ' Chiropractic ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Rural Community ', ' Self Management ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Instruction ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Complementary Medicine ', ' Complementary and alternative medicine ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ', ' NCCAM ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Guidelines ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' population survey ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Depth ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Home Remedy ', ' ']",NCCIH,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,457194,0.08071237855885154
"CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This is a new application for Phase I of the Community Network Program (CNP) RFA.  The purpose is to propose an active and comprehensive community-based program to reduce disparities of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in metropolitan Detroit.  We propose to mobilize an intensive system of community-based participatory education, training, and research, given that data from our region demonstrate that older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of these cancers, are first diagnosed at later stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates.  The goal of our proposed CNP is to catalyze and sustain a strong community based movement to significantly improve access to and engagement of beneficial interventions to increase cancer screening and early stage detection, diagnosis and treatment.  This RFA affords a most important and unique opportunity for researchers and clinicians at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI), the Institute of Gerontology (IOG) and the Center for Urban and African American Health (CUAAH), all at Wayne State University, to combine our expertise and community contacts to create a vibrant and comprehensive community participatory education, training and behavioral research program.

"CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This is a new application for Phase I of the Community Network Program (CNP) RFA.  The purpose is to propose an active and comprehensive community-based program to reduce disparities of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in metropolitan Detroit.  We propose to mobilize an intensive system of community-based participatory education, training, and research, given that data from our region demonstrate that older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of these cancers, are first diagnosed at later stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates.  The goal of our proposed CNP is to catalyze and sustain a strong community based movement to significantly improve access to and engagement of beneficial interventions to increase cancer screening and early stage detection, diagnosis and treatment.  This RFA affords a most important and unique opportunity for researchers and clinicians at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI), the Institute of Gerontology (IOG) and the Center for Urban and African American Health (CUAAH), all at Wayne State University, to combine our expertise and community contacts to create a vibrant and comprehensive community participatory education, training and behavioral research program.

"Prevention of HIV/AIDS and STDs in Women over Fifty    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV infection is on the rise among older women in the U.S. There is an urgent need for culturally- sensitive, gender-specific, and age-appropriate HIV prevention interventions for older women, particularly minority older women who are most at-risk - a need that is disturbingly unmet. The need to overcome stigma and privacy barriers to HIV/AIDs and STD education in this group, combined with the explosive growth in the number of wired seniors, including minority seniors, makes an e-intervention an ideal delivery method for addressing this problem, and for addressing ethnic disparities in HIV infection rates among older women. Our overall goal is to develop a comprehensive (educational and behavioral), tailored, accessible, and innovative HIV/AIDs and STD prevention e-intervention for culturally-diverse older women age 50 and over. Specific Phase 1 Aims are to: 1) Develop a prototype website for a risk reduction e-intervention for culturally- diverse older women, incorporating a ""peer chatroom"" and ""ask the expert"" segment; 2) Collect pilot data to develop an individually tailored online coaching component to be incorporated into the Phase 2 site; 3) Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and immediate effectiveness of the Phase 1 site for increasing knowledge and perceived risks; and, 4) Prepare for the Phase 2 application with respect to functional expansion, evaluation, and commercialization of the website, to be developed in Phase I. Specific Aims for the Phase 2 application are to 1) Expand the ""peer chatroom"" to a fully-functional, interactive component of the website for users to meet peers, and share stories and experiences; 2) Expand the ""ask the expert"" segment to a fully-functional, interactive component in which user questions will be answered and posted on the website on an ongoing basis; 3) Incorporate scheduled, individually tailored, online behavioral coaching sessions with a health expert (nurse, gynecologist, or social worker); 4) Implement and evaluate the effectiveness of the enhanced risk reduction intervention in a randomized controlled trial, focusing on both proximal (e.g., increasing self-efficacy for safe sex practices, sexual negotiation skills, and physician communication skills), and distal outcomes (e.g., increase in consistent safe sex practices, successful sexual negotiation, and successful physician communication, including appropriate HIV/AID/STD testing); 5) Market the website through collaboration with national and local aging organizations, including CyberSeniors and the New England Association of HIV Over 50; and, 6) Commercialize the product(s) through individual subscription, advertising, and partnerships with other companies and nonprofits to ensure financial and administrative sustainability of the website. Environment and Health Inc. is well poised to successfully accomplish the proposed aims, given our highly qualified team, technical expertise, and infrastructure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV infection rates are rising among older women, particularly African American women, creating public health and distributive justice imperatives for culturally-sensitive and gender-specific HIV and STD prevention interventions for older women. To date, no such interventions exist. We propose developing the first comprehensive (educational and behavioral), tailored, accessible, and innovative STD and HIV prevention e- intervention for culturally-diverse older women. The intervention will help prevent STD and HIV infection among older women, and reduce ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS.           HIV infection rates are rising among older women, particularly African American women, creating public health and distributive justice imperatives for culturally-sensitive and gender-specific HIV and STD prevention interventions for older women.

"Cost-related Underuse of Medications and the Health of Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cost-related Medication Nonadherence and the Health of Older Adults Becky Briesacher, Ph.D., is a health services researcher and Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently-funded researcher supported by rich mentorship and fruitful collaborations in the area of aging and drug policy. Dr. Briesacher seeks a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) to gain: (1) a better understanding of cost-related medication nonadherence (CRN) and its effect on the health of older adults, and (2) research experience with models that account for irrationality in health behaviors. The candidate proposes a career development plan that provides new training in behavioral economics, targeted exposure to clinical geriatrics, and advanced statistical methods in longitudinal analyses. The research program includes: (1) creating a unique, longitudinal dataset from two national health surveys of older adults, (2) describing the longitudinal course of CRN, including identifying the predictors and potential consequences on patient health and health care expenditures, and (3) developing models of CRN in older adults that incorporate principles from behavioral economics, particularly time-inconsistency. The advanced training and three-part research program will provide the foundation for Dr. Briesacher's transition to an independent investigator in geriatric health services research. In addition, this research program will inform issues central to Medicare Part D prescription drug program and its effects on the health and financial stability of older adults. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Strong evidence shows that medication adherence decreases with higher cost-sharing, yet medication cost- sharing is rising, most notably in Medicare Part D. Discovering how optimal cost-sharing may improve medication adherence has significant implications for the health and welfare of an aging society that is increasingly dependent on medications.

"PENN RCMAR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Schools of Medicine and Nursing of the University of Pennsylvania propose a new Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR): ""Reducing Health Disparities Across the Stages of Illness in Older Minority Populations with Chronic Disease."" The RCMAR will collaborate with community stakeholders through established research partnerships, and with internal and external institutions and programs that have an established track record of interdisciplinary, health disparities and aging research, and experience mentoring junior investigators and minority investigators. The proposed Center activities are contained in four cores: Administrative, Investigator Development, Community Liaison, and Measurement. The investigator core faculty are leaders in disparities and aging research in the clinical, social, behavioral, epidemiology, and health services fields. The Measurement Core faculty provide consultative expertise in an array of methodological issues pertinent to disparities research: data collection (qualitative and mixed methods) and instrument development, study design and sampling, secondary data analysis, and translation of evidence to communities through participatory research partnerships. The Community Liaison Core will advance the science of community engagement in research, inclusive of but not restricted to recruitment. The principal goals of the Penn RCMAR are to: 1) Conduct research across the stages of chronic illness with the aim of improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities in minority older adults. We aim to specify and evaluate diverse variables (individual, social, economic, health systems, family, and community) and their relationship to health care delivery (access and quality) and health outcomes across various stages of illness; 2) Design and test interventions at the patient, provider, organizational, and environmental levels that reduce health disparities in minority older adults; 3) Train and mentor diverse investigators to undertake health disparities research in these populations; 4) Prepare a wide range of community organizations and stakeholders to participate actively in the design and conduct of research and the dissemination of results. The RCMAR is characterized by an interdisciplinary senior faculty, and prominent minority leadership and participation. In year one, four pilots are proposed in the local community: 1) perceived future needs for transition to a nursing home, 2) spirituality in persons with hypertension, 3) exercise post breast cancer treatment, and 4) sleep perception and significance.

"Norms for the Assessment Memory Impairment in Spanish Speaking Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research on cognitive impairment in Spanish speaking older adults has been constrained by the lack of appropriate methodologies for assessment and by the extremely limited availability of published cognitive assessment tests and norms for individuals residing in the U.S. This varies from the progress made in the assessment of other ethnic minority English speaking populations, such as African Americans, where ethnic specific cognitive norms have been collected and published. Hispanic, Spanish speakers present a unique challenge in that cognitive tests administered in English are inappropriate for use with monolingual and some bilingual Spanish speakers. The limited availability of appropriate assessment tools and strategies for Spanish speakers necessarily also limits the ability of clinicians to accurately diagnose memory and other cognitive impairment in this population, contributing to the health disparities between Hispanic and other populations in this country. The objective of the proposed research is to adapt into Spanish a commonly used clinical measure of memory functioning to establish preliminary norms which take into consideration key demographic variables that recent research has shown to influence test performance. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To establish a Spanish list learning test comparable to the published (English) CVLT II to assess learning and memory; 2) To analyze differences in performance on the Spanish test and the CVLT II versions in a group of healthy bilingual individuals and to compare performance of bilinguals with two groups of demographically matched monolingual individuals; 3) To determine whether traditional demographic variables of age, education, and gender will influence or modify performance on the two list learning tests and whether the variables will have a similar influence on a narrative memory test, and 4) To determine whether use of unique variables, such as percentage of time residing in the U.S., percentage of education in the U.S., language preference, and language proficiency, aid in predicting performance on the list learning tests and the narrative memory test, above that explained by traditional demographic variables typically used in the development of norms for clinical cognitive assessment tests. Spanish speaking older adults present a challenge to health care professionals who may misdiagnose individuals with memory impairment due to a lack of appropriate language tools and methods. This research will facilitate the development of appropriate measures to improve diagnosis and reduce health disparities between Hispanic and other populations in this country.          ",Norms for the Assessment Memory Impairment in Spanish Speaking Older Adults,7565961,R21AG028609,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Body of uterus ', ' Uterine Body ', ' Corpus Uteri ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Measurement ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Mexico ', ' news ', ' bilingualism ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' programs ', ' Spain ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Verbal Learning ', ' Work ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' California ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' comparison group ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' language processing ', ' lexical ', ' stem ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2009,157850,0.0067228961312257324

"Costa Rican Health and Retirement Survey    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application proposes to field two waves of a new, nationally representative longitudinal Costa Rican Health and Retirement Survey targeting Costa Rican adults near retirement age, born 1945-1955. This would complement an on-going longitudinal household survey of older Costa Ricans born before 1945 (CRELES). A number of factors make Costa Rica an important site for the study of older adults' health and economic status: (a) Costa Rica has higher life expectancy than even the United States, with lower age-specific mortality rates among adults. The proposed data would allow unique new insight into life-course social and economic determinants of Costa Rica's success, as well as investigation of the bi-directional relationships between health and work among older adults in this exemplar population. (b) Past work has found Costa Rica to have unusually small socioeconomic gradients in health and economic well-being. This project is designed to allow deeper exploration of the role of public and private support underlying these remarkable inequality patterns. (c) Costa Rica experienced one of the earliest and fastest fertility transitions in the developing world, with total fertility dropping from 7.3 births in 1960 to 3.7 by 1976. By focusing on the parental cohorts experiencing this decline, this survey can uniquely advance understanding of the long- term demographic dividends of fertility decline. (d) Costa Rica provides a particularly rich study setting due to the ability to retrospectively and prospectively link the proposed microdata with high quality registries of vital events such as deaths, creating the ability to follow the sampled cohort at low cost indefinitely into the future. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed project would generate a unique new dataset for studying the determinants of longevity in a country considered a success story for having achieved ""good health at low cost."" Furthermore, it would enable detailed study of social and economic conditions surrounding retirement in a country on the leading edge of the aging transition in Latin America.             ",Costa Rican Health and Retirement Survey,7682144,R01AG031716,"['Costa Rica ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Social Network ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Fertility ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Household ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Labor Forces ', ' Latin America ', ' insight ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Costa Rican ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mexican ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Reliance ', ' Pensions ', ' Retirement Benefits ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Registries ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Social Welfare ', ' welfare ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' United States ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' Salivary ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' social model ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' glycosylated hemoglobin C ', ' glycosylated Hb C ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' expectation ', ' social ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Accounting ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' Intergenerational transfer ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2009,408711,0.04997437097730339
"Ideal Affect and Health Decision Making Across the Lifespan    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the number of minorities and older adults in the U.S. increase, it is increasingly important to reduce health care disparities among these groups. Recent reports have shown that ethnic disparities in health care utilization, such as successful patient-physician communication and engagement in preventative behaviors, are especially critical for older adults. Optimal health care depends on whether an individual chooses to follow their doctors' recommendations, adhere to prescribed treatments, and engage in health promotion programs. Understanding cultural and age-related differences in how these choices are made can help to reduce disparities in health care. The proposed program of research will test applications of Affect Valuation Theory (AVT) as a theoretical foundation for understanding cultural and age-related differences in how health care decisions are made. AVT suggests that variation in ""ideal affect"" (i.e., the affective states that people value) may contribute to cultural and age-related differences in health care decisions. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) Examine the relationship between ideal affect and health care decisions; and (2) Determine whether cultural and age-related differences in ideal affect may in part account for differences in health care decisions. Using both survey and experimental methods, we will investigate the relationship between ideal affect and health decision making across the life span for two distinct cultural groups, European American and Chinese American. First, we will measure how ideal affect influences health care decision making among participants ranging in age from 21 to 80. Then, we will manipulate ideal affect and subsequently assess preferences for health care options. Findings from these studies will establish the role of ideal affect and health care decision making as a potential mechanism for explaining ethnic health disparities across the life span.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By understanding how ideal affect influences decision making across age and cultural groups, the proposed research will help to develop more culturally sensitive and appropriate treatments and interventions. Thus, integrating ideal affect into the improvement of health care programs may address the needs of diverse populations more adequately.           ",Ideal Affect and Health Decision Making Across the Lifespan,7810451,F31AG032199,"['Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Aerobic ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' infection with HBV ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' European ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Methods ', ' Music ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Shapes ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' programs ', ' Arousal ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Time ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mtb infection [{C0041296}] ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' Woman ', ' Behavior ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Measures ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' Walking ', ' Chinese American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communication ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Minority ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' Affective ', ' healthy aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,41176,0.05976675942842003
"Experienced-based and Subjective Well-being Survey Toolkits for Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (04) Clinical Research and the NIA specific Challenge Topic 04-AG-105: Development of experience-based measures of well-being. There is an interdisciplinary resurgence of interest in the correlates and consequences of subjective and objective well- being in old age. In part, this interest is fueled by new evidence about mind-body interactions, including associations between affective well-being, immune functioning, cardiovascular illness, and longevity. Few longitudinal national studies of the older population include well-being measures in their protocols. This reflects a longstanding debate within and between disciplines about the validity and comparability of subjective versus objective scales and the lack of standard survey measures. Thus, the current challenge is to develop a valid and reliable instrument to assess experienced well-being in older adults. Ideally this instrument could be included in a survey toolkit of subjective and objective measures so that future researchers from different disciplines can begin to address knowledge gaps about well-being and health. Our approach to this challenge involves several innovative steps. In particular, we: 1) create a new survey measure of experience-based well-being for older adults to address the limitations of existing measures and link the new measure to health-related activities; 2) undertake extensive psychometric analyses of existing HRS data on cognitive and affective subjective well-being to provide a benchmark to assess the added-value of the new measure and to derive optimized subjective scales to add to a comprehensive survey toolkit; 3) collect data on our new measures of objective and subjective well-being in two studies with older adults (telephone and in-person: N = 960); 4) evaluate the reliability and validity of the new instruments using data obtained in the two studies and determine their unique potential to differentiate subgroups with different levels of health; and 5) conduct pilot work on an innovative survey measure of observed (behavioral) well-being. Together these new studies and analyses will provide answers to the following questions: Does our innovative survey measure of experienced well-being provide reliable and valid information? Is it possible to optimize the current HRS measures of cognitive and affective subjective well-being without compromising reliability and validity? Are objective and subjective components of well-being sensitive to socio-demographic factors and health disparities? What are the associations among objective and subjective components of well-being in old age? The outcome of the proposed project will be an innovative, well-documented, and validated toolkit for the assessment of objective and subjective well-being in large surveys of older adults. The application of this toolkit, especially in multidisciplinary longitudinal surveys, will increase our understanding of the relative importance of the experience-based, cognitive, and affective components of well-being for health in old age and contribute valuable evidence to effectively shape public policy and intervention strategies. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative longitudinal study of the population over 50, this project will identify markers of subjective, experience-based, and observed well-being associated with health outcomes. Different aspects of experienced well-being (e.g., life satisfaction, positive affect, time invested in pleasurable activities) have been linked to immune functioning, cardiovascular illness, brain functioning, and longevity. We will develop and test parsimonious measures of experienced well-being suitable for large multidisciplinary surveys so that population trends in well-being and subgroups at risk can be studied.              Project Narrative Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative longitudinal study of the population over 50, this project will identify markers of subjective, experience-based, and observed well-being associated with health outcomes.

"Social Inequalities in Outcomes for Treatment of Late-Life Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Late-life depression (LLD) is a major public health concern. It is associated with substantial impairment and disability in social and cognitive domains, increases risk for and exacerbates the severity of comorbid medical conditions [4-6], elevates risk for suicidality, and is a significant contributor to mortality. These associations and risks take on greater significance because LLD is commonly under-diagnosed and inadequately treated. Epidemiological research also suggests the presence of social inequalities in LLD. Socioeconomic status (SES), usually assessed by measures of education, income, wealth, occupation, and/or neighborhood characteristics, is associated with risk of depression in older adults (=60 years). Indeed, these risks appear to widen with age, with older adults of lower SES having markedly elevated risk for depression. Evidence is mixed about racial/ethnic inequalities. Whereas rates of LLD are higher among White males than among African-American and Hispanic males, older White males appear to have lower levels of depressive symptoms than older African American males. Furthermore, there is evidence that African Americans and Hispanics, in general, experience higher rates of chronic depression. The relationship between race/ethnicity and depression is itself, influenced by gender, income, and education. This application is for a small research grant (R03) to conduct secondary data analyses to investigate social and racial/ethnic inequalities in outcomes of antidepressant treatments in older adults. These analyses emerge from an initial study in which Cohen et al., (2006) reported SES (as measured by census tract median household income) was a significant moderator of antidepressant treatment in two clinical trials in which all subjects received high quality care. The proposed research will expand on this work by conducting an investigation of possible social inequalities in the effectiveness of PROSPECT (Prevention of Suicide in Primary Care Elderly: Collaborative Trial), a multi-site randomized clinical trial of an intervention (pharmacotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and case management) for the treatment of LLD. We will also investigate whether the relative effectiveness of the intervention depended social inequalities in positive changes in social support during treatment and/or the extent to which patients took advantage of various components of the intervention. The proposed research will benefit from its use of data from a randomized clinical trial that was conducted in ""real-world"" primary care settings and included a heterogeneous sample of depressed older adults, as well as the availability of multiple measures SES and race/ethnicity at the level of individuals and the neighborhoods in which they lived. Results of this research may yield insights about: 1) the social factors that influence the effectiveness of treatments, even when controlling for access and the quality of treatment; 2) the clinical and public health needs of population subgroups; and, 3) the need for methodological changes in future clinical trials. More generally, we expect this research will make an important contribution to our understanding of health disparities. Late-life depression is a major public health concern in that it is associated with increased risk for functional disability, suicidality, and mortality. Expanding on preliminary research, which suggested social inequalities in the effectiveness of antidepressant treatments, the proposed research will investigate social inequalities (as measured by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity) in the effectiveness of a primary care intervention for reducing depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and suicidality, and improving functional status in older adults. Results of this research may yield new insights about: 1) the social factors that influence the effectiveness of treatments, even when controlling for access and the quality of treatment; 2) the clinical and public health needs of population subgroups; and, 3) the need for methodological changes in future clinical trials.          ",Social Inequalities in Outcomes for Treatment of

"Racial Disparities in Older Adults:  Impact of Medicare Part D    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Both hypertension and ischemic heart disease (IHD which includes those with a history of myocardial infarction [MI] or it's risk equivalent diabetes) are more common and more likely to be inadequately controlled in older African Americans when compared to older Caucasians. One key pathway to these racial disparities is greater cost related medication non adherence in older African Americans when compared to Caucasians. Medicare Part D which began January 2006 provides a drug benefit for those enrolled. The impact of this health policy intervention on racial disparities in medication use and control of chronic diseases such as hypertension and ischemic heart disease is unknown. The long-term objective of our proposed study is to reduce racial disparities in health outcomes by examining the impact of this policy intervention of increasing prescription drug coverage among the elderly. Using a longitudinal design we will examine two objectives. Objective 1 is to determine the impact of the Medicare Part D drug benefit intervention on racial differences in the use of antihypertensive medications in those with hypertension and the use of lipid lowering medications in those with IHD (i.e., those with a history of MI and/or diabetes. One specific hypothesis to be tested is that after the Medicare Part D implementation, older Africans Americans in this high risk group will receive more intense antihypertensive regimens than older Caucasians. A second specific hypothesis to be tested is that the disparity in any lipid lowering medication use between Caucasian and African American older adults in these high risk groups will be reduced after Medicare Part D implementation. Objective 2 is to determine the impact of the Medicare Part D drug benefit intervention on racial disparities in the control of hypertension and IHD. One specific hypothesis to be tested is that the disparity in uncontrolled blood pressure between Caucasian and African American older adults with hypertension will be reduced after Medicare Part D implementation. A second specific hypothesis to be tested is that the disparity in uncontrolled lipid levels between Caucasian and African American older adults with IHD will be reduced after Medicare Part D implementation. This study capitalizes on longitudinal data from the ongoing 11 year Medicare population based National Institute on Aging (NIA) funded Health Aging and Body Composition Study. Our multidisciplinary research team has extensive experience conducting health policy analyses, pharmaco-epidemiological studies with geriatric populations, health disparities and cardiovascular disease research and is uniquely positioned to shed light on this critical policy issue. Moreover, our proposed research is responsive to one of the three research action areas (public policy) outlined in PAR 07-379 entitled ""Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities"" and will shed light upon the effectiveness of the Medicare Part D intervention to reduce health disparities. This study is also consistent with the interests of the National Institute on Aging's Behavioral and Social Research Program's Health Disparities Initiatives. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Both access to drug therapy treatment and chronic disease guideline adherence are included as part of the recently released list by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) entitled ""Evidentiary Priorities for the Elderly Population"". This list provides clinical research topics for which there are significant knowledge gaps.

"Peripheral Nerve Function Decline in an Aged Cohort    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although poor peripheral nerve function is common in older age, the rate of decline with aging is unknown. Diabetes and other known causes of neuropathy appear to account for very little of the loss of nerve function with advancing age. We conducted a cross-sectional epidemiologic study of the prevalence and risk factors or poor peripheral sensory and motor nerve function in the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) cohort. The Health ABC baseline cohort included 3075 men and women (42 percent African-American and 52 percent women). Of these, 1462 survivors aged 80-89 years of age are expected for their eleventh year follow- up exam. Longitudinal data from 2000-01 to 2007-08 will make it possible to determine whether nerve function declines are related to prospective lower extremity disability in 2008-10 and whether or not these associations are mediated by changes in muscle, bone density, and strength. We have documented cross- sectionally that peripheral nerve function is critical to their lower extremity function and mobility and is associated with muscle strength and bone density, demonstrating the importance of the peripheral nerves in sarcopenia and age-related disability. Analyses of numerous potential risk factors in Health ABC have revealed that age itself remains strongly related to poorer peripheral nerve function, even when accounting for established risk factors such as diabetes, and novel risk factors such as subclinical peripheral arterial disease and Caucasian race. To date, no U.S. study has reported the rate of decline in these aspects of peripheral nerve function with aging or has determined whether they precede lower extremity disability. The specific aims are to determine 1) declines in peripheral sensory and motor nerve function over six years and risk factors for these declines (demographic factors, vitamin B12 status, impaired glucose metabolism, subclinical peripheral arterial disease) in Caucasian and African-American older adults; and 2) if the rate of decline in peripheral sensory and motor nerve function is prospectively related to rate of recurrent falls and a decline in self-reported walking ability over two years. This study addresses many goals of the NIA, defined in its strategic plan, including prevention of disability, understanding age-related change and evaluating ethnic disparities. The Health ABC Study provides a unique and cost-effective opportunity to quantify and identify risk factors for decline in sensory and motor nerve function and relate these declines to prospective disability for the first time among a large group of older adults.              ",Peripheral Nerve Function Decline in an Aged Cohort,7644421,R01AG028050,"['sarcopenia ', ' Accounting ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' cost ', ' bone strength ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' population based ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Impaired fasting glycaemia ', ' impaired fasting glucose ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Motor ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' Hyperinsulinism ', ' Hyperinsulinemia ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' indexing ', ' disability ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' bone mass ', ' diabetic ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Muscle ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Nerve ', ' Neural Conduction ', ' Nerve Conduction ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Ankle ', ' Tarsus ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Peripheral Nerves ', ' peroneal nerve ', ' Fibular Nerve ', ' Physical Examination ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vitamin B 12 ', ' vitamin B12 compound ', ' Vitamin B12 ', ' VIT B12 ', ' Cyanocobalamin (Vitatmin B12) ', ' Cyanocobalamin ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Neuropathy ', ' neuropathic ', ' Sensory ', ' Upper arm ', ' vibration ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' muscle strength ', ' Body Composition ', ' Bone Density ', ' Bone Mineral Density ', ' glucose metabolism ', ' cohort ', ' bone loss ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Peripheral Vascular Diseases ', ' peripheral blood vessel disorder ', ' Peripheral Vascular Disorder ', ' Peripheral Angiopathies ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Deterioration ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2009,525660,0.014564766375385544
"Research and Mentorship in Improving Diabetes Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Dr. Marshall Chin's career goals are to perform research that improves the care and outcomes of particularly vulnerable patients with diabetes and to mentor trainees entering this research field. Translation of research findings from clinical trials is challenging. Thus, diabetes care in real-world settings is suboptimal. Indigent, minority patients who receive their care in community health centers are a vulnerable population at risk for poor outcomes. In addition, older persons who frequently are frail, have multiple comorbid conditions, and may have limited social support, are another high-risk group.  Dr. Chin's research program aims to: 1) Improve diabetes care and outcomes in community health centers by developing and implementing multifactorial interventions combining techniques from continuous quality improvement, chronic disease management, provider-patient communication training, and patient empowerment; 2) Improve care of older persons with diabetes by individualizing care and facilitating shared decision making between patient and provider; 3) Develop the Chicago Diabetes Mentoring Program in Patient-Oriented Research.  The candidate is Associate Professor of Medicine; Director, Diabetes Research and Training Center Prevention and Control Core; Associate Director, Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program, and Co-Director of General Internal Medicine Research at the University of Chicago. He has been funded to improve diabetes care and outcomes in community health centers, and study preferences of older persons with diabetes. With his previous research and mentoring success, in an environment rich with academic opportunities in the biomedical and social sciences relevant for diabetes patient-oriented translational research, this K24 award will allow him to increase his mentoring activities and to enhance his own commitment and skills in patient-oriented diabetes research among vulnerable populations ",Research and Mentorship in Improving Diabetes Care,7679480,K24DK071933,"['Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Environment ', ' Caring ', ' Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24) ', ' K24 Award ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' Scholars Program ', ' Research Training ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Clinical ', ' Indigent ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Funding ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Societies ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Attitude ', ' Wood material ', ' Wood ', ' Work ', ' Award ', ' Techniques ', ' Marshal ', ' preference ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' success ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' empowerment ', ' Prevention ', ' Chicago ', ' Chin ', ' Mentum ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' Communication ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' diabetic patient ', ' shared decision making ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K24,2009,171677,0.04204344045156621
"Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Deep South RCMAR will serve as research-based and mentoring investment in the process of closing the health disparities gap between African American and non-minority older adults. In addition, the Deep South RCMAR will increase the number of researchers with the capacity to conduct independent, peer-reviewed research related to minority aging and health disparities. The RCMAR will focus on health problems that are particularly prevalent among older African Americans, and will give special attention to issues related to rural elders; intervention research addressing exercise, diet, or preventive health strategies; and studies addressing socio-economic, discrimination, trust, and bioethical issues impacting both measures of both physical and mental health. The Deep South RCMAR will create research infrastructure for the following objectives: (1) establish a mechanism for mentoring research careers; (2) enhance cultural diversity of the professional workforce conducting research on the health of older persons; (3) conduct research on and disseminate strategies for recruiting and retaining African American older adults in research; (4) facilitate innovative strategies to support enduring research careers in minority health, and/or encourage the recruitment of established researchers to undertake research on minority aging health; (5) improve the research methods and tools necessary to conduct rigorous and comparable research on diverse populations; (6) advance scientific knowledge leading to a decrease in health disparities; and (7) disseminate to scientific and non-scientific communities research results addressing the resolution of health disparities through the improvement of minority health, particularly for older African Americans. The Deep South RCMAR will be composed of three interacting and collaborative cores (administration, investigator development, and community liaison) created by and built upon the unique strengths of four partnering institutions (Morehouse School of Medicine, Tuskegee University, University of Alabama, and University of Alabama at Birmingham). The cores will provide an infrastructure to provide training and mentoring programs, fund three pilot projects per year, and nurture community relations needed to meet the stated objectives. The Deep South RCMAR will ultimately become not only a regional, but also a national resource for expertise related to the mechanisms of health disparities between older African Americans and whites.           ",Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research,7666746,P30AG031054,"['health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Institution ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Resolution ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Process ', ' base ', ' career ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Alabama ', ' minority health ', ' Research Peer Review ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Investments ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' tool ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Bioethical Issues ', ' meetings ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' Community Relations ', ' Minority ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Deep South ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,P30,2009,978707,0.04750080542554918
"Ethnic Variation in CAM Use and Health Self Management among Rural Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is widely used among older adults. However, overall levels of CAM use and specific modalities used among elders differ by ethnicity, gender and age. Neither the causes of ethnic differences in CAM use nor the effects of CAM use on ethnic differences in the health status or quality of life have been clearly identified. Few studies of CAM use are conceptually driven, and most do not explore the social or cultural factors related to CAM use. Studies have not examined specific CAM use behaviors; rather, they rely on self-reports of use in the past month or past year without trying to measure the actual frequency of CAM modality use or the predictors of specific CAM modality use. Population based studies of CAM use have not measured how specific CAM therapy use is related to health status or quality of life among older adults or minority group members. The overall goals of this project are to delineate ethnic differences in the CAM therapies used by rural elders and to determine ethnic differences in how these modalities are incorporated into health self-management. To attain these goals, this project will: (1) delineate the cognitive models of CAM among African American and white rural older adults that shape health self-management (components of these cognitive models include knowledge and beliefs about CAM modalities, information sources about CAM modalities, the purposes for which these modalities are used, the reasons for using these modalities, and how they are integrated into conventional health care); (2) determine the actual use of CAM modalities among African American and white rural elders; (3) delineate how the use of CAM modalities among African American and white elders affects the use of conventional medical care, and (4) determine the association of CAM modality use among African American and white rural elders with health-related quality of life. This research is structured by a conceptual framework that integrates concepts of health self-management with concepts from cognitive models of health. The design includes two components. First, in-depth interviews will be completed with 64 rural African American and white elders. Second, 6 times at monthly intervals structured interviews will be completed for 3 consecutive days with a sample of 200 rural African American and white elders. This project addresses health disparities by investigating why and how ethnic and racial minority populations use CAM. It reflects the recommendations of the lOM's Committee on the Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine by the American Public to use quantitative and qualitative methods to examine sociocultural dimensions of illness and health care- seeking processes and preferences, how well CAM users adhere to treatment guidelines, and how individuals evaluate information about CAM modalities.           ",Ethnic Variation in CAM Use and Health Self Management among Rural Older Adults,7684258,R01AT003635,"['Home Remedy ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maintenance ', ' Minerals ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Shapes ', ' grandparent ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Time ', ' Vitamins ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Chiropractic (field) ', ' Chiropractic ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Rural Community ', ' Self Management ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Instruction ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' population based ', ' Complementary and alternative medicine ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ', ' NCCAM ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Guidelines ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' population survey ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' traditional therapy ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' ']",NCCIH,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,425269,0.08071237855885154
"CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This is a new application for Phase I of the Community Network Program (CNP) RFA.  The purpose is to propose an active and comprehensive community-based program to reduce disparities of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in metropolitan Detroit.  We propose to mobilize an intensive system of community-based participatory education, training, and research, given that data from our region demonstrate that older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of these cancers, are first diagnosed at later stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates.  The goal of our proposed CNP is to catalyze and sustain a strong community based movement to significantly improve access to and engagement of beneficial interventions to increase cancer screening and early stage detection, diagnosis and treatment.  This RFA affords a most important and unique opportunity for researchers and clinicians at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI), the Institute of Gerontology (IOG) and the Center for Urban and African American Health (CUAAH), all at Wayne State University, to combine our expertise and community contacts to create a vibrant and comprehensive community participatory education, training and behavioral research program.  We are located in downtown Detroit, and our collective mission is to serve the health and welfare needs of our minority constituencies living in our socially and economically challenged urban neighborhoods.  The aim for the first year is to create enduring partnerships among community leaders, researchers and medical professionals to facilitate and sustain education, research and training programs that reduce disparities; the aim of the second year is to develop community-based participatory research and training projects to promote secondary prevention behaviors including early detection, treatment seeking and routine surveillance; and the aim for years 3-5 is to implement, evaluate and sustain interventions and research to eradicate cancer health disparities         ",CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults,7933452,U01CA114583,"['health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' training project ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Improve Access ', ' Information Resources ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' Research Training ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Heart ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Institutes ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentorship ', ' Michigan ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"The Online Health Literacy of Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Internet holds great promise as a health information source for older Americans; however, little is known about older people's online health literacy. Online health literacy is the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information from the Internet. The main goal of the proposed research is to examine older people's online health literacy in terms of the strategies and success people have in finding accurate and useful online health information. The research's specific aims are: (1) Explore the strategies used by older adults to successfully navigate the Internet to answer typical health questions, where success is considered in terms of accuracy, perceived usefulness, and knowledge gained; (2) Assess whether older adults' online health literacy is related to gender, ethnicity, education, socio-economic status, experience with technology, and general health literacy; and (3) Compare online health literacy of older adults to that of younger adults and adolescents, determining if similar patterns exist across different age groups (where the groups are 16-21, 22-44, 45-64, and 65 and older). To address these aims, 500 participants will be recruited from the Baltimore-Washington D.C. and San Francisco regions. In media laboratories at Johns Hopkins or Stanford, participants will perform an activity where they try to find answers to open- and closed-ended health questions by searching the Internet. The research will employ innovative methods to monitor participants as they answer the questions, recording the websites visited, the applications run, and even what participants focused on when they looked at the computer screen. A subsample of 40 older adult participants will also use a talk-aloud procedure to allow the researchers to better know the participants' understanding, concerns and motivations while searching online. This research will improve our understanding of how older adults use the Internet as a health information source. The results can advance how individuals are trained to effectively use this medium, as well as inform the ways in which providers and other health care professionals communicate health messages through the Internet.           ",The Online Health Literacy of Older Adults,7640813,R01AG026430,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Psychological Well Being and Recovery Among Older Hospitalized Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposed study addresses the Program Announcement entitled ""Research on Mind-Body Interactions and Health"" (PA-07-046). Specifically, we address the National Institute on Aging (NIA) interest in exploring associations between psychological well-being and functional ability in older adults hospitalized for acute illness. The Specific Aims of the proposed application are to: 1. Examine change in functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. Functional status will be assessed by a battery of measures (a 4 meter walk, a test of grip strength, knee extensor strength and seven activities of daily living (ADLs)) at 5 time points: within 24 hours of hospital admission and discharge, and 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge. 2. Examine direct and indirect associations between psychological well-being and functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. Psychological well-being, assessed by a 6- domain psychological well-being instrument and a positive affect summary scale, will be used to examine patterns of association with functional status over the 5 time points outlined in aim 1. 3. Examine whether psychological well-being modifies ethnic health disparities associated with functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. This aim will allow us to examine how ethnic group (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics) interacts with psychological well-being to influence functional status over the 5 time points outlined in aim 1. To explore our aims, we plan to follow up an ethnically diverse sample of 800 older patients (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics) admitted to the Acute Care for Elders (ACE) unit at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Older adults enrolled in the study will be assessed at five time points: within 24 hours of hospital admission, within 24 hours of hospital discharge and 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge. The five time points will allow us not only to examine overall patterns of effect between functional status and psychological well-being but it will also allow us to examine patterns of effect over distinct time periods including hospitalization and post discharge. The three post discharge follow up interviews will further allow us to examine and explain associations between functional status and psychological well-being in relation to short (1 month) and longer term (6 and 12 month) recovery patterns. A central goal of the current application is to examine whether psychological well-being can influence the risk for functional status decline associated with hospitalization in an ethnically diverse older patient population.          ",Psychological Well Being and Recovery Among Older Hospitalized Adults,7662265,R01AG031178,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Interview ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Knee ', ' Recovery ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Patients ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Mind-Body Relationship (Physiology) ', ' mind body interaction ', ' brain-body interaction ', ' Relations, Mind-Body (Physiology) ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Well in self ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Mental well-being ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' meter ', ' interest ', ' functional status ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' body-mind ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Sampling ', ' Communities ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' patient population ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R01,2009,431623,0.05681933364459836
"Aging and Varieties of Cognitive Control Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Verhaeghen, Paul SUMMARY The present proposal aims at investigating age-related processes (memorial or executive) that contribute to the often-observed decline in working memory capacity. The working memory model we adopt is Cowan's (2001) hierarchical, embedded-process model, which has a limited-capacity focus of attention at its core. Our own recent work has shown that age differences in accuracy of working memory performance is often tied to overflow of the immediate focus of attention: Older adults lose information at a higher rate than younger adults when the task forces them to switch between processing and storage, although they are not slower at retrieving the information that is still available. In a series of experiments (most purely behavioral in nature, some including the study of event-related potentials [ERP]) we investigate the source of this increased information-loss. We investigate the following questions:  1. Are the control processes that are implicated in focus switching -- that is, coordination (dual-tasking  between encoding and retrieval), resistance to interference (as revealed by the filtering efficiency in the  contralateral delay activity component in ERP), and updating (as revealed by late components in ERP),  as well as the attention switch itself (again investigated using ERP) -- age-sensitive? 2. Are the mechanisms of binding and unbinding objects into working memory age-sensitive? (This  question will be investigated using time-accuracy functions, as well as by analyzing unbinding costs  using the race model inequality.) 3. Does age diminish the propensity for flexible control (Braver et al., 2007), as measured by proactive  control and/or behavioral plasticity? (This will be investigated by manipulating the need for precise  control and investigating whether this manipulation changes the strategic approach to the task as  revealed by patterns of RT and/or accuracy, as well as by studies of prolonged practice.) The study will aid in a deeper understanding of the origins of age deficits tied to memory and of subject- initiated remediation, potentially leading to diagnostic instruments and/or sensible interventions.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Older adults lose information at a faster rate than younger adults once the information leaves the immediate focus of attention. This proposal investigates whether this deficit is due to memory processes (binding), executive control processes (coordination, updating, resistance to interference, attention switching), or both, and whether older adults are capable of flexible control over these processes. The study will aid in a deeper understanding of the origins of age deficits tied to memory and of subject-initiated remediation, potentially leading to diagnostic instruments and/or sensible interventions.",Aging and Varieties of Cognitive Control,7868662,R56AG016201,"['Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Elements ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Inequality ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' Review Literature ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reaction Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rotation ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' programs ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Contralateral ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Gray unit of radiation dose ', ' Gray ', ' Episodic memory ', ' Performance ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' memory process ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' age difference ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Measures ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' visual search ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' remediation ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' cognitive system ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Attention ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' ']",NIA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R56,2009,369862,0.0632179379836258
"Computer Agents to Promote Walking in Older Adults with Low Health Literacy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  More than one-third of U.S. adults over 65 years of age have inadequate or marginal functional health literacy, and among indigent and minority patients in urban areas this number rises to over 80 percent. Face-to- face conversation with health providers remains one of the best methods for communicating health information to patients with low health literacy. The investigators have developed and successfully pilot tested a new computer agent technology for simulating face-to-face conversation with older adult patients in order to effect health education and behavior change in the area of physical activity promotion. In this research project the investigators will translate this pilot work into a computer system and protocol that can be readily deployed to ambulatory care settings, and will evaluate the efficacy of the resulting system as a mechanism to promote behavioral change among older adult patients with low health literacy in a two-arm randomized clinical trial. The intervention will be tailored for use primarily by an urban, African American, older adult population and evaluated in a similar study population. The computer agent intervention for walking promotion among older adults will occur in two-phases: (1) an intensive in-home, two-month, daily contact intervention deployed on a portable, touch-screen computer that patients carry home from the clinic, followed by (2) an occasional contact intervention via a kiosk-based computer that patients use when they come to their primary care clinic for an additional 10 months, to promote maintenance of walking behavior. The resulting intervention will be evaluated in a randomized study to assess its impact on walking behavior, fitness and mobility, and well-being in patients stratified by health literacy level, compared to a standard-of- care control condition. Older adults who begin an exercise program can reduce their risk of several chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, etc.) as well as depression, disability, falls and overall mortality. Low health literacy has been associated with limitations in instrumental activities of daily living, activities of daily living, and limitations in activity because of physical health. The proposed study will determine whether a low-cost automated system that can be easily deployed from ambulatory clinics will be effective in motivating older adults with low literacy to obtain more physical activity.           ",Computer Agents to Promote Walking in Older Adults with Low Health Literacy,7644979,R01AG028668,"['Cues ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' IADL ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' Population Research ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Behavioral ', ' Comprehension ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Gestures ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Indigent ', ' Interview ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' literacy ', ' Loneliness ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' satisfaction ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Simulate ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Urban Population ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Upper arm ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' behavior change ', ' gaze ', ' experience ', ' Population Study ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Walking ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' touchscreen ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' Minority ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' group intervention ', ' standard of care ', ' depression ', ' health information technology ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2009,622902,-0.008900935858021309

"Linking Personality and SES Influences on Lifespan Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this K08 Mentored Career Development Award application, Ben Chapman, PhD, a psychologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC), proposes to integrate approaches from personality psychology and social epidemiology to study socioeconomically (SES) based health disparities across the latter part of life. Proposed are a comprehensive educational plan, original data collection, and secondary analyses of existing datasets designed to equip the applicant to become a leading investigator of how the social stratification in lifespan health trajectories is influenced by individual personality. He will receive formal training in social epidemiology, health and aging, and multilevel statistics through formal coursework and mentored didactics with a team of nationally recognized experts in these areas. Dr. Chapman's research program proposes two scientific aims, based on a synthesis of theory and findings from social epidemiology and personality and health, under a conceptual framework of life course epidemiology. The Aims examine the interaction between personality and SES factors influencing health behaviors and general illness burden across the second half of life. New data collection focuses on how personality influences health under conditions of socioeconomic deprivation, involving 18-24 month follow up of a pilot cohort (N=106) of ethnically diverse, lower SES middle age and older adults currently being accrued. This will provide Dr. Chapman with valuable experience following a small cohort over a short time, in preparation for larger studies, and obtain health data rare in existing data sources, like inflammatory biomarkers. Existing data sources are selected for longitudinal information on personality, SES, and health, permitting well-powered hypothesis tests over the Midlife Development in the US, Hawaii Culture and Health, and Older Adults in Primary Care studies. From a public health view, lifespan health is powerfully tied to social inequalities; but not all disadvantaged people suffer worse, and not all advantaged people enjoy better health as they age. Attention to individual psychological and behavioral dispositions can aid understanding of this heterogeneity.

"Cost-related Underuse of Medications and the Health of Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cost-related Medication Nonadherence and the Health of Older Adults Becky Briesacher, Ph.D., is a health services researcher and Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently-funded researcher supported by rich mentorship and fruitful collaborations in the area of aging and drug policy. Dr. Briesacher seeks a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) to gain: (1) a better understanding of cost-related medication nonadherence (CRN) and its effect on the health of older adults, and (2) research experience with models that account for irrationality in health behaviors. The candidate proposes a career development plan that provides new training in behavioral economics, targeted exposure to clinical geriatrics, and advanced statistical methods in longitudinal analyses. The research program includes: (1) creating a unique, longitudinal dataset from two national health surveys of older adults, (2) describing the longitudinal course of CRN, including identifying the predictors and potential consequences on patient health and health care expenditures, and (3) developing models of CRN in older adults that incorporate principles from behavioral economics, particularly time-inconsistency. The advanced training and three-part research program will provide the foundation for Dr. Briesacher's transition to an independent investigator in geriatric health services research. In addition, this research program will inform issues central to Medicare Part D prescription drug program and its effects on the health and financial stability of older adults. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Strong evidence shows that medication adherence decreases with higher cost-sharing, yet medication cost- sharing is rising, most notably in Medicare Part D. Discovering how optimal cost-sharing may improve medication adherence has significant implications for the health and welfare of an aging society that is increasingly dependent on medications.           ",Cost-related Underuse of Medications and the Health of Older Adults,7690882,K01AG031836,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Older Population ', ' Monitor ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' beneficiary ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services for the Aged ', ' health services for seniors ', ' health services for older people ', ' health services for older adults ', ' Health Services for the Elderly ', ' Geriatric Health Services ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Surveys ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Incentives ', ' inducement ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Lipids ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Collaborations ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Exposure to ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Social Welfare ', ' welfare ', ' Societies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Event ', ' Behavior ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Buffers ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Accounting ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' longitudinal course ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K01,2009,124940,0.12098206629909745
"Racial Disparities in Heart Attack Recovery: Role of Stress and Stigma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), older African Americans tend to have significantly worse functional recovery and higher mortality rates than same-aged Whites. Race differences in older individuals' cardiovascular outcomes remain after adjusting for factors that traditionally have been used to explain this disparity, such as socioeconomic status and access to health care. Our overall goal is to examine whether this racial disparity in older individuals' AMI-recovery outcomes is partially explained by the combined influence of age stigma and race stigma, both of which can generate stress.       Based on our pilot data, the stigma literature, and Rutter's theory of cumulative risk, we will examine the following hypotheses for the first time: (1) African Americans and Whites with greater age stigma will have worse functional recovery; (2) Age stigma's deleterious influence on functional recovery will be greater among African Americans than Whites; (3) Among African Americans, (a) those with greater age stigma and race stigma will have worse functional recovery, and (b) age stigma and race stigma will act in a synergistic way to worsen functional recovery; and (4) Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction will mediate the process by which (a) age stigma impacts the functional recovery of African Americans and Whites, and (b) race stigma impacts the functional recovery of African Americans.       The secondary aim of the proposed study is to identify methods to help older persons recovering from an AMI cope with age stigma and race stigma. We will focus on coping strategies that may be amenable to future interventions.       Using a prospective, longitudinal design, our interdisciplinary team will assess 200 African Americans and 200 Whites, aged 50 and over, within a week of hospital admission following an AMI, and assess them again one month, four months, eight months, and twelve months later. Functional recovery will be assessed by physical performance over time. The mediator, ANS dysfunction, will be measured by 24-hour heart-rate variability and acute response to laboratory stressors. Secondary outcomes consist of depression, cognitive functioning, and adverse cardiovascular events. Relevant covariates will be included in analyses, such as age, AMI severity, and depression.       This study is responsive to PA-05-029,  Societal and Cultural Dimensions of Health,  because we will examine how the societal construct of stigma influences AMI recovery. Additionally, the study fits the NHLBI Strategy for Addressing Health Disparities which includes identifying psychosocial mechanisms that contribute to the progression of diseases that disproportionately affect minorities. The proposed research could illuminate an unexplored mechanism that enable stigmas to worsen health. In addition, it could lay the groundwork for future interventions to improve the AMI-recovery experience of older persons in general and African American older persons in particular.      Public Health Relevance: The worse recovery of older African Americans following a heart attack has been a persistent public-health problem. We expect to show how a previously unexplored psychological factor, in combination with a physical factor, contributes to the disparity between African American and White recovery. Further, our research could lay the groundwork for future cost-effective procedures to improve heart attack recovery of older persons in general and African American older persons in particular.          ",Racial Disparities in Heart Attack Recovery: Role of Stress and Stigma,7616196,R01HL089314,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Hospitals ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' racism ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Laboratory Finding ', ' Lab Findings ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Literature ', ' Ageism ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Exposure to ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stigmata ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Stress ', ' cognitive function ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Belief ', ' psychosocial ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Glossary ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' depression ', ' depressed ', ' heart rate variability ', ' longitudinal design ', ' ']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,825680,0.04286844078494607
"Psychological Well Being and Recovery Among Older Hospitalized Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposed study addresses the Program Announcement entitled ""Research on Mind-Body Interactions and Health"" (PA-07-046). Specifically, we address the National Institute on Aging (NIA) interest in exploring associations between psychological well-being and functional ability in older adults hospitalized for acute illness. The Specific Aims of the proposed application are to: 1. Examine change in functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. Functional status will be assessed by a battery of measures (a 4 meter walk, a test of grip strength, knee extensor strength and seven activities of daily living (ADLs)) at 5 time points: within 24 hours of hospital admission and discharge, and 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge. 2. Examine direct and indirect associations between psychological well-being and functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. Psychological well-being, assessed by a 6- domain psychological well-being instrument and a positive affect summary scale, will be used to examine patterns of association with functional status over the 5 time points outlined in aim 1. 3. Examine whether psychological well-being modifies ethnic health disparities associated with functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. This aim will allow us to examine how ethnic group (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics) interacts with psychological well-being to influence functional status over the 5 time points outlined in aim 1. To explore our aims, we plan to follow up an ethnically diverse sample of 800 older patients (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics) admitted to the Acute Care for Elders (ACE) unit at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Older adults enrolled in the study will be assessed at five time points: within 24 hours of hospital admission, within 24 hours of hospital discharge and 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge. The five time points will allow us not only to examine overall patterns of effect between functional status and psychological well-being but it will also allow us to examine patterns of effect over distinct time periods including hospitalization and post discharge. The three post discharge follow up interviews will further allow us to examine and explain associations between functional status and psychological well-being in relation to short (1 month) and longer term (6 and 12 month) recovery patterns. A central goal of the current application is to examine whether psychological well-being can influence the risk for functional status decline associated with hospitalization in an ethnically diverse older patient population.

"CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This is a new application for Phase I of the Community Network Program (CNP) RFA.  The purpose is to propose an active and comprehensive community-based program to reduce disparities of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in metropolitan Detroit.  We propose to mobilize an intensive system of community-based participatory education, training, and research, given that data from our region demonstrate that older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of these cancers, are first diagnosed at later stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates.  The goal of our proposed CNP is to catalyze and sustain a strong community based movement to significantly improve access to and engagement of beneficial interventions to increase cancer screening and early stage detection, diagnosis and treatment.  This RFA affords a most important and unique opportunity for researchers and clinicians at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI), the Institute of Gerontology (IOG) and the Center for Urban and African American Health (CUAAH), all at Wayne State University, to combine our expertise and community contacts to create a vibrant and comprehensive community participatory education, training and behavioral research program.  We are located in downtown Detroit, and our collective mission is to serve the health and welfare needs of our minority constituencies living in our socially and economically challenged urban neighborhoods.  The aim for the first year is to create enduring partnerships among community leaders, researchers and medical professionals to facilitate and sustain education, research and training programs that reduce disparities; the aim of the second year is to develop community-based participatory research and training projects to promote secondary prevention behaviors including early detection, treatment seeking and routine surveillance; and the aim for years 3-5 is to implement, evaluate and sustain interventions and research to eradicate cancer health disparities         ",CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults,7631479,U01CA114583,"['health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' training project ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Improve Access ', ' Information Resources ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' Research Training ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Heart ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Institutes ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentorship ', ' Michigan ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Organizational Variability and Racial Disparities in Hospice Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  My goal is to become an academic geriatrician focused on reducing disparities in end-of-life care. I have already initiated this career plan through completion of a Master of Health Sciences and research examining cultural attitudes and beliefs which may impact hospice use by older African Americans. With this award, I would acquire additional training in health disparities research. My research and career development plan will be overseen by mentors with research expertise in end-of-life care and content expertise related to the care of African Americans with life-limiting illness. Compared to Caucasians, African Americans are more likely to experience poor quality healthcare at the end of life. Also, studies document lower rates of hospice use among older African Americans. Because hospice is currently the most effective model for care at the end of life, increasing hospice use by older African Americans may reduce racial disparities in end-of-life care. To date, no research has evaluated the association between the organizational characteristics of hospices and disparities in their service to older African Americans and Caucasians. This research will test the hypothesis that racial disparities in hospice use are associated with variability in the structure, programs, and policies of individual hospice agencies. The specific aims are to: (1) Describe hospice-level variability in disparities in service to older African Americans and Caucasians; (2) Describe hospice-level variability in structure, programs, and policies which may influence hospice use by African Americans; (3) Identify organizational characteristics that facilitate the use of hospice by African Americans. This research will include: an analysis of Medicare Claims Data and a comprehensive database of the characteristics of hospices throughout North and South Carolina; and a survey and qualitative interview with hospice providers in the two states. The findings of this work will inform the development of organizational-level interventions to increase hospice use by older African Americans and eliminate racial disparities throughout the life course. Plain public health statement: Despite higher mortality rates from a number of chronic illnesses, African Americans use hospice services at lower rates that Caucasians.

"CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This is a new application for Phase I of the Community Network Program (CNP) RFA.  The purpose is to propose an active and comprehensive community-based program to reduce disparities of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in metropolitan Detroit.  We propose to mobilize an intensive system of community-based participatory education, training, and research, given that data from our region demonstrate that older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of these cancers, are first diagnosed at later stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates.  The goal of our proposed CNP is to catalyze and sustain a strong community based movement to significantly improve access to and engagement of beneficial interventions to increase cancer screening and early stage detection, diagnosis and treatment.  This RFA affords a most important and unique opportunity for researchers and clinicians at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI), the Institute of Gerontology (IOG) and the Center for Urban and African American Health (CUAAH), all at Wayne State University, to combine our expertise and community contacts to create a vibrant and comprehensive community participatory education, training and behavioral research program.  We are located in downtown Detroit, and our collective mission is to serve the health and welfare needs of our minority constituencies living in our socially and economically challenged urban neighborhoods.  The aim for the first year is to create enduring partnerships among community leaders, researchers and medical professionals to facilitate and sustain education, research and training programs that reduce disparities; the aim of the second year is to develop community-based participatory research and training projects to promote secondary prevention behaviors including early detection, treatment seeking and routine surveillance; and the aim for years 3-5 is to implement, evaluate and sustain interventions and research to eradicate cancer health disparities         ",CNP for Older Underserved

"Anemia  and Its Relationship with Sarcopenia, Physical Function, and Mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anemia is a common health problem in US older populations; and it increases the risk for disability, decline in physical performance, low muscle strength, and premature death in the elderly. A recent study from NHANES III reported the prevalence of anemia being larger than 10% in the US population over age 65, and the prevalence of anemia varied by ethnicity, suggesting significant health disparities in minorities, especially in the African American population. In this study, a large (N >160,000) multiethnic (non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, African American, Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander) cohort from the nationwide Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study will be used to investigate the relationships of aging with anemia epidemiology, pathology and prognosis. Specifically, we will 1) evaluate the frequency of and risk factors for anemia overall and according to race-ethnicity and co-morbidity; 2) determine the association between anemia and risk of death over 10 years of follow-up in the WHI overall and by race-ethnicity; 3) determine associations between anemia and changes in physical function over 9 years of follow-up in the WHI cohort overall and by race- ethnicity; 4) examine associations of anemia with muscle loss (sarcopenia) among those with baseline and prospective measurements of body composition from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; and 5) study the association of anemia with bone loss and risk for osteoporotic fractures in older women. In addition, the frequency of anemia subtypes by morphologic categories and optimal cutoff points of hemoglobin concentrations for anemia in older women will be evaluated. This study will use archived observational and clinical trial data from 40 WHI clinical centers. Additional data entering for blood analysis from existing reports, and data merging (body composition measurements) will be conducted in the WHI DXA cohort from Arizona, Birmingham and Pittsburgh. Multivariate data analyses will be conducted for the specific aims. The WHI provides a unique and invaluable resource for answering the research questions proposed above, as the WHI is the only study in the nation that has prospective co-morbidities and body composition data as well as hemoglobin values in multiethnic groups of older women. This study has a great potential to provide new and critical evidence that is needed for preventing and managing anemia in older women from different health, age and ethnic backgrounds.          ","Anemia  and Its Relationship with Sarcopenia, Physical Function, and Mortality",7570020,R01AG029133,"['Pattern ', ' Physical Function ', ' muscle strength ', ' osteoporosis with pathological fracture ', ' Osteoporotic fracture ', ' Osteoporosis with fracture ', ' Fracture due to osteoporosis ', ' Elderly woman ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Body Composition ', ' Bone Density ', ' Bone Mineral Density ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' cohort ', ' bone loss ', ' Calcium ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Participant ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Diet Modification ', ' Dietary Modifications ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' sarcopenia ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Anemia due to Chronic Disorder ', ' anemia of inflammation ', ' anemia of chronic disease ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' older women ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry ', ' DXA ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' Subgroup ', ' Supplementation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Observational Study ', ' Older Population ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Natural History ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Hemoglobin concentration result ', ' hemoglobin level ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' muscle form ', ' muscle mass ', ' muscle bulk ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Skeletal muscle structure ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Skeletal Muscle Tissue ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Morbidity -

"Impact of Medicare Part D on Racial Disparities in Diabetes Treatment and Outcome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many older adults respond to high out-of-pocket drug costs by skipping, reducing dosages of or not filling prescriptions for their medications. A primary goal of the new Medicare drug benefit (Part D) was to increase the availability of drug coverage and thereby improve medication use among older adults. Medicare Part D may have a disproportionate impact on medication use among beneficiaries in minority groups. For instance, African American beneficiaries have enrolled in Part D in greater numbers (62% vs. 48%) than Caucasian beneficiaries. Moreover, African American beneficiaries are more likely than Caucasian beneficiaries to qualify for generous Part D low-income subsidies. As a result, Part D may help to alleviate racial/ethnic disparities in clinical processes of care and health outcomes that have been documented for a range of chronic conditions   among older adults. We will assess the impact of Part D on racial disparities in medication use and health outcomes for older adults with diabetes, a chronic condition with increasing prevalence. Given the worse glycemic control and higher diabetes-related mortality among African Americans compared to Caucasians, our proposed investigations have critical implications for health disparities. The long-term objective of our proposed study is to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in health by examining the impact of changes in insurance coverage among the elderly. This proposal has two primary objectives. First, we will assess racial differences in antidiabetic medication use, glycemic control, and diabetes-related hospitalizations and mortality for an elderly cohort with diabetes before the implementation of Part D. We hypothesize that older African American beneficiaries with diabetes will have lower levels of antidiabetic medication use, worse glycemic control, and higher diabetes-related hospitalization and mortality rates compared to Caucasian beneficiaries. Second, we will examine whether Part D mitigates racial disparities in medication use, glycemic control, and diabetes-related hospitalizations and mortality in the elderly. We hypothesize that older African Americans compared to Caucasians will experience a larger improvement in medication use, glycemic control, and diabetes-related hospitalizations and mortality. Our study will use longitudinal data from an 11-year, Medicare population-based prospective cohort study. We will adjust our estimates of the effect of race and Part D for socioeconomic status, comorbidities, health, functional and cognitive status, access to care, and other factors. Our research has important policy implications. Medicare Part D -- the most substantial expansion of insurance benefits to older adults since the program's inception over 40 years ago -- is projected to cost just under $1 trillion between 2007 and 2017. If Medicare Part D reduces racial disparities in medication access, our study will inform other efforts to expand insurance coverage to vulnerable populations. Our multidisciplinary research team has extensive experience conducting health policy analyses, pharmacoepidemiologic studies with geriatric populations, health disparities and diabetes research, and is uniquely positioned to shed light on this critical policy issue.             ",Impact of Medicare Part D on Racial Disparities in Diabetes Treatment and Outcome,7560147,R01HS017695,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2009,180276,0.04968621843607962
"Early and Mid-Life Social Determinants of Racial Disparities in Late-Life Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed study is to examine childhood and mid-life adulthood social determinants of health disparities between older blacks and whites. The study will assess racial disparities in late-life health in four biological outcomes: blood pressure, glycemic control, sub-clinical cerebrovascular disease, and inflammation. These outcomes were selected because of their relevance for racial disparities in health and the prevention of late-life disability and cognitive impairment. The study will focus on personal social resources (e.g., education, occupational status), and residential environment social conditions (e.g., birth county level of socio-economic status, neighborhood segregation during adulthood), and examine the degree to which these social resources and conditions experienced prior to older age account for racial disparities in late-life health. The study will also test whether racial disparities in late-life health ablood specimens in this population which are needed to obtain a measure of glycemic control. Despite general improvements in overall health among older adults in the US, racial disparities in late-life health continue to be large and pervasive. Racial differences in social resources and conditions in earlier stages of life are likely to be an important factor in alleviating these disparities. Findings from this study will provide a better understanding of the social and biological mechanisms that contribute to racial disparities in late-life health, creating a foundation for policies and strategies to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities between older blacks and whites. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite general improvements in overall health among older adults in the US, racial disparities in late-life health continue to be large and pervasive. Racial differences in late- life health are likely to depend on social resources and conditions experienced earlier in life, butmportance to the prevention of disability and cognitive impairment in old age. An important strength of the study is that it will take advantage of the availability of detailed information on most social and biological factors of interest. This information is derived from an ongoing cohort study in a large population of older blacks and whites. Findings from this study are expected to provide a better understanding of the social and biological mechanisms that contribute to racial disparities in late-life health, creating a foundation for policies and strategies to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities between older blacks and whites.

"Costa Rican Health and Retirement Survey    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application proposes to field two waves of a new, nationally representative longitudinal Costa Rican Health and Retirement Survey targeting Costa Rican adults near retirement age, born 1945-1955. This would complement an on-going longitudinal household survey of older Costa Ricans born before 1945 (CRELES). A number of factors make Costa Rica an important site for the study of older adults' health and economic status: (a) Costa Rica has higher life expectancy than even the United States, with lower age-specific mortality rates among adults. The proposed data would allow unique new insight into life-course social and economic determinants of Costa Rica's success, as well as investigation of the bi-directional relationships between health and work among older adults in this exemplar population. (b) Past work has found Costa Rica to have unusually small socioeconomic gradients in health and economic well-being. This project is designed to allow deeper exploration of the role of public and private support underlying these remarkable inequality patterns. (c) Costa Rica experienced one of the earliest and fastest fertility transitions in the developing world, with total fertility dropping from 7.3 births in 1960 to 3.7 by 1976. By focusing on the parental cohorts experiencing this decline, this survey can uniquely advance understanding of the long- term demographic dividends of fertility decline. (d) Costa Rica provides a particularly rich study setting due to the ability to retrospectively and prospectively link the proposed microdata with high quality registries of vital events such as deaths, creating the ability to follow the sampled cohort at low cost indefinitely into the future. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed project would generate a unique new dataset for studying the determinants of longevity in a country considered a success story for having achieved ""good health at low cost."" Furthermore, it would enable detailed study of social and economic conditions surrounding retirement in a country on the leading edge of the aging transition in Latin America.             ",Costa Rican Health and Retirement Survey,7906840,R01AG031716,"['Costa Rican ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mexican ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Reliance ', ' Pensions ', ' Retirement Benefits ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Registries ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Social Welfare ', ' welfare ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' United States ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' Salivary ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' social model ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' glycosylated hemoglobin C ', ' glycosylated Hb C ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' expectation ', ' social ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Accounting ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' Intergenerational transfer ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' Drops ', ' Costa Rica ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Social Network ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Fertility ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Household ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Labor Forces ', ' Latin America ', ' insight ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2010,286339,0.04997437097730339
"Peripheral Nerve Function Decline in an Aged Cohort    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although poor peripheral nerve function is common in older age, the rate of decline with aging is unknown. Diabetes and other known causes of neuropathy appear to account for very little of the loss of nerve function with advancing age. We conducted a cross-sectional epidemiologic study of the prevalence and risk factors or poor peripheral sensory and motor nerve function in the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) cohort. The Health ABC baseline cohort included 3075 men and women (42 percent African-American and 52 percent women). Of these, 1462 survivors aged 80-89 years of age are expected for their eleventh year follow- up exam. Longitudinal data from 2000-01 to 2007-08 will make it possible to determine whether nerve function declines are related to prospective lower extremity disability in 2008-10 and whether or not these associations are mediated by changes in muscle, bone density, and strength. We have documented cross- sectionally that peripheral nerve function is critical to their lower extremity function and mobility and is associated with muscle strength and bone density, demonstrating the importance of the peripheral nerves in sarcopenia and age-related disability. Analyses of numerous potential risk factors in Health ABC have revealed that age itself remains strongly related to poorer peripheral nerve function, even when accounting for established risk factors such as diabetes, and novel risk factors such as subclinical peripheral arterial disease and Caucasian race. To date, no U.S. study has reported the rate of decline in these aspects of peripheral nerve function with aging or has determined whether they precede lower extremity disability. The specific aims are to determine 1) declines in peripheral sensory and motor nerve function over six years and risk factors for these declines (demographic factors, vitamin B12 status, impaired glucose metabolism, subclinical peripheral arterial disease) in Caucasian and African-American older adults; and 2) if the rate of decline in peripheral sensory and motor nerve function is prospectively related to rate of recurrent falls and a decline in self-reported walking ability over two years. This study addresses many goals of the NIA, defined in its strategic plan, including prevention of disability, understanding age-related change and evaluating ethnic disparities. The Health ABC Study provides a unique and cost-effective opportunity to quantify and identify risk factors for decline in sensory and motor nerve function and relate these declines to prospective disability for the first time among a large group of older adults.              ",Peripheral Nerve Function Decline in an Aged Cohort,7890536,R01AG028050,"['Demographic Factors ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Impaired fasting glycaemia ', ' impaired fasting glucose ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Motor ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' Hyperinsulinism ', ' Hyperinsulinemia ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' indexing ', ' disability ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' bone mass ', ' diabetic ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Muscle ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Nerve ', ' Neural Conduction ', ' Nerve Conduction ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Ankle ', ' Tarsus ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Peripheral Nerves ', ' peroneal nerve ', ' Fibular Nerve ', ' Physical Examination ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vitamin B 12 ', ' vitamin B12 compound ', ' Vitamin B12 ', ' VIT B12 ', ' Cyanocobalamin (Vitatmin B12) ', ' Cyanocobalamin ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Neuropathy ', ' neuropathic ', ' Sensory ', ' vibration ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' muscle strength ', ' Body Composition ', ' Bone Density ', ' Bone Mineral Density ', ' glucose metabolism ', ' cohort ', ' bone loss ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Peripheral Vascular Diseases ', ' peripheral blood vessel disorder ', ' Peripheral Vascular Disorder ', ' Peripheral Angiopathies ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Deterioration ', ' sarcopenia ', ' Accounting ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' cost ', ' bone strength ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' population based ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2010,445719,0.014564766375385544
"PENN RCMAR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Schools of Medicine and Nursing of the University of Pennsylvania propose a new Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR): ""Reducing Health Disparities Across the Stages of Illness in Older Minority Populations with Chronic Disease."" The RCMAR will collaborate with community stakeholders through established research partnerships, and with internal and external institutions and programs that have an established track record of interdisciplinary, health disparities and aging research, and experience mentoring junior investigators and minority investigators. The proposed Center activities are contained in four cores: Administrative, Investigator Development, Community Liaison, and Measurement. The investigator core faculty are leaders in disparities and aging research in the clinical, social, behavioral, epidemiology, and health services fields. The Measurement Core faculty provide consultative expertise in an array of methodological issues pertinent to disparities research: data collection (qualitative and mixed methods) and instrument development, study design and sampling, secondary data analysis, and translation of evidence to communities through participatory research partnerships. The Community Liaison Core will advance the science of community engagement in research, inclusive of but not restricted to recruitment. The principal goals of the Penn RCMAR are to: 1) Conduct research across the stages of chronic illness with the aim of improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities in minority older adults. We aim to specify and evaluate diverse variables (individual, social, economic, health systems, family, and community) and their relationship to health care delivery (access and quality) and health outcomes across various stages of illness; 2) Design and test interventions at the patient, provider, organizational, and environmental levels that reduce health disparities in minority older adults; 3) Train and mentor diverse investigators to undertake health disparities research in these populations; 4) Prepare a wide range of community organizations and stakeholders to participate actively in the design and conduct of research and the dissemination of results. The RCMAR is characterized by an interdisciplinary senior faculty, and prominent minority leadership and participation. In year one, four pilots are proposed in the local community: 1) perceived future needs for transition to a nursing home, 2) spirituality in persons with hypertension, 3) exercise post breast cancer treatment, and 4) sleep perception and significance.

"Early and Mid-Life Social Determinants of Racial Disparities in Late-Life Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed study is to examine childhood and mid-life adulthood social determinants of health disparities between older blacks and whites. The study will assess racial disparities in late-life health in four biological outcomes: blood pressure, glycemic control, sub-clinical cerebrovascular disease, and inflammation. These outcomes were selected because of their relevance for racial disparities in health and the prevention of late-life disability and cognitive impairment. The study will focus on personal social resources (e.g., education, occupational status), and residential environment social conditions (e.g., birth county level of socio-economic status, neighborhood segregation during adulthood), and examine the degree to which these social resources and conditions experienced prior to older age account for racial disparities in late-life health. The study will also test whether racial disparities in late-life health ablood specimens in this population which are needed to obtain a measure of glycemic control. Despite general improvements in overall health among older adults in the US, racial disparities in late-life health continue to be large and pervasive. Racial differences in social resources and conditions in earlier stages of life are likely to be an important factor in alleviating these disparities. Findings from this study will provide a better understanding of the social and biological mechanisms that contribute to racial disparities in late-life health, creating a foundation for policies and strategies to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities between older blacks and whites.

Racial differences in late- life health are likely to depend on social resources and conditions experienced earlier in life, butmportance to the prevention of disability and cognitive impairment in old age. An important strength of the study is that it will take advantage of the availability of detailed information on most social and biological factors of interest. This information is derived from an ongoing cohort study in a large population of older blacks and whites.

"Experienced-based and Subjective Well-being Survey Toolkits for Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (04) Clinical Research and the NIA specific Challenge Topic 04-AG-105: Development of experience-based measures of well-being. There is an interdisciplinary resurgence of interest in the correlates and consequences of subjective and objective well- being in old age. In part, this interest is fueled by new evidence about mind-body interactions, including associations between affective well-being, immune functioning, cardiovascular illness, and longevity. Few longitudinal national studies of the older population include well-being measures in their protocols. This reflects a longstanding debate within and between disciplines about the validity and comparability of subjective versus objective scales and the lack of standard survey measures. Thus, the current challenge is to develop a valid and reliable instrument to assess experienced well-being in older adults. Ideally this instrument could be included in a survey toolkit of subjective and objective measures so that future researchers from different disciplines can begin to address knowledge gaps about well-being and health. Our approach to this challenge involves several innovative steps. In particular, we: 1) create a new survey measure of experience-based well-being for older adults to address the limitations of existing measures and link the new measure to health-related activities; 2) undertake extensive psychometric analyses of existing HRS data on cognitive and affective subjective well-being to provide a benchmark to assess the added-value of the new measure and to derive optimized subjective scales to add to a comprehensive survey toolkit; 3) collect data on our new measures of objective and subjective well-being in two studies with older adults (telephone and in-person: N = 960); 4) evaluate the reliability and validity of the new instruments using data obtained in the two studies and determine their unique potential to differentiate subgroups with different levels of health; and 5) conduct pilot work on an innovative survey measure of observed (behavioral) well-being. Together these new studies and analyses will provide answers to the following questions: Does our innovative survey measure of experienced well-being provide reliable and valid information? Is it possible to optimize the current HRS measures of cognitive and affective subjective well-being without compromising reliability and validity? Are objective and subjective components of well-being sensitive to socio-demographic factors and health disparities? What are the associations among objective and subjective components of well-being in old age? The outcome of the proposed project will be an innovative, well-documented, and validated toolkit for the assessment of objective and subjective well-being in large surveys of older adults. The application of this toolkit, especially in multidisciplinary longitudinal surveys, will increase our understanding of the relative importance of the experience-based, cognitive, and affective components of well-being for health in old age and contribute valuable evidence to effectively shape public policy and intervention strategies. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative longitudinal study of the population over 50, this project will identify markers of subjective, experience-based, and observed well-being associated with health outcomes. Different aspects of experienced well-being (e.g., life satisfaction, positive affect, time invested in pleasurable activities) have been linked to immune functioning, cardiovascular illness, brain functioning, and longevity. We will develop and test parsimonious measures of experienced well-being suitable for large multidisciplinary surveys so that population trends in well-being and subgroups at risk can be studied.              Project Narrative Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative longitudinal study of the population over 50, this project will identify markers of subjective, experience-based, and observed well-being associated with health outcomes.

"Racial Disparities in Older Adults:  Impact of Medicare Part D    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Both hypertension and ischemic heart disease (IHD which includes those with a history of myocardial infarction [MI] or it's risk equivalent diabetes) are more common and more likely to be inadequately controlled in older African Americans when compared to older Caucasians. One key pathway to these racial disparities is greater cost related medication non adherence in older African Americans when compared to Caucasians. Medicare Part D which began January 2006 provides a drug benefit for those enrolled. The impact of this health policy intervention on racial disparities in medication use and control of chronic diseases such as hypertension and ischemic heart disease is unknown. The long-term objective of our proposed study is to reduce racial disparities in health outcomes by examining the impact of this policy intervention of increasing prescription drug coverage among the elderly. Using a longitudinal design we will examine two objectives. Objective 1 is to determine the impact of the Medicare Part D drug benefit intervention on racial differences in the use of antihypertensive medications in those with hypertension and the use of lipid lowering medications in those with IHD (i.e., those with a history of MI and/or diabetes. One specific hypothesis to be tested is that after the Medicare Part D implementation, older Africans Americans in this high risk group will receive more intense antihypertensive regimens than older Caucasians. A second specific hypothesis to be tested is that the disparity in any lipid lowering medication use between Caucasian and African American older adults in these high risk groups will be reduced after Medicare Part D implementation. Objective 2 is to determine the impact of the Medicare Part D drug benefit intervention on racial disparities in the control of hypertension and IHD. One specific hypothesis to be tested is that the disparity in uncontrolled blood pressure between Caucasian and African American older adults with hypertension will be reduced after Medicare Part D implementation. A second specific hypothesis to be tested is that the disparity in uncontrolled lipid levels between Caucasian and African American older adults with IHD will be reduced after Medicare Part D implementation. This study capitalizes on longitudinal data from the ongoing 11 year Medicare population based National Institute on Aging (NIA) funded Health Aging and Body Composition Study. Our multidisciplinary research team has extensive experience conducting health policy analyses, pharmaco-epidemiological studies with geriatric populations, health disparities and cardiovascular disease research and is uniquely positioned to shed light on this critical policy issue. Moreover, our proposed research is responsive to one of the three research action areas (public policy) outlined in PAR 07-379 entitled ""Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities"" and will shed light upon the effectiveness of the Medicare Part D intervention to reduce health disparities. This study is also consistent with the interests of the National Institute on Aging's Behavioral and Social Research Program's Health Disparities Initiatives. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Both access to drug therapy treatment and chronic disease guideline adherence are included as part of the recently released list by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) entitled ""Evidentiary Priorities for the Elderly Population"". This list provides clinical research topics for which there are significant knowledge gaps. If Medicare Part D reduces racial disparities by increasing access to medication use which leads to better control of hypertension and IHD, then our study will inform other initiatives to expand insurance coverage to other vulnerable populations.           Project Narrative Both access to drug therapy treatment and chronic disease guideline adherence are included as part of the recently released list by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) entitled ""Evidentiary Priorities for the Elderly Population"".

"Early and Mid-Life Social Determinants of Racial Disparities in Late-Life Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed study is to examine childhood and mid-life adulthood social determinants of health disparities between older blacks and whites. The study will assess racial disparities in late-life health in four biological outcomes: blood pressure, glycemic control, sub-clinical cerebrovascular disease, and inflammation. These outcomes were selected because of their relevance for racial disparities in health and the prevention of late-life disability and cognitive impairment. The study will focus on personal social resources (e.g., education, occupational status), and residential environment social conditions (e.g., birth county level of socio-economic status, neighborhood segregation during adulthood), and examine the degree to which these social resources and conditions experienced prior to older age account for racial disparities in late-life health. The study will also test whether racial disparities in late-life health ablood specimens in this population which are needed to obtain a measure of glycemic control. Despite general improvements in overall health among older adults in the US, racial disparities in late-life health continue to be large and pervasive. Racial differences in social resources and conditions in earlier stages of life are likely to be an important factor in alleviating these disparities. Findings from this study will provide a better understanding of the social and biological mechanisms that contribute to racial disparities in late-life health, creating a foundation for policies and strategies to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities between older blacks and whites. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite general improvements in overall health among older adults in the US, racial disparities in late-life health continue to be large and pervasive. Racial differences in late- life health are likely to depend on social resources and conditions experienced earlier in life, butmportance to the prevention of disability and cognitive impairment in old age. An important strength of the study is that it will take advantage of the availability of detailed information on most social and biological factors of interest. This information is derived from an ongoing cohort study in a large population of older blacks and whites. Findings from this study are expected to provide a better understanding of the social and biological mechanisms that contribute to racial disparities in late-life health, creating a foundation for policies and strategies to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities between older blacks and whites.

"Computer Agents to Promote Walking in Older Adults with Low Health Literacy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  More than one-third of U.S. adults over 65 years of age have inadequate or marginal functional health literacy, and among indigent and minority patients in urban areas this number rises to over 80 percent. Face-to- face conversation with health providers remains one of the best methods for communicating health information to patients with low health literacy. The investigators have developed and successfully pilot tested a new computer agent technology for simulating face-to-face conversation with older adult patients in order to effect health education and behavior change in the area of physical activity promotion. In this research project the investigators will translate this pilot work into a computer system and protocol that can be readily deployed to ambulatory care settings, and will evaluate the efficacy of the resulting system as a mechanism to promote behavioral change among older adult patients with low health literacy in a two-arm randomized clinical trial. The intervention will be tailored for use primarily by an urban, African American, older adult population and evaluated in a similar study population. The computer agent intervention for walking promotion among older adults will occur in two-phases: (1) an intensive in-home, two-month, daily contact intervention deployed on a portable, touch-screen computer that patients carry home from the clinic, followed by (2) an occasional contact intervention via a kiosk-based computer that patients use when they come to their primary care clinic for an additional 10 months, to promote maintenance of walking behavior. The resulting intervention will be evaluated in a randomized study to assess its impact on walking behavior, fitness and mobility, and well-being in patients stratified by health literacy level, compared to a standard-of- care control condition. Older adults who begin an exercise program can reduce their risk of several chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, etc.) as well as depression, disability, falls and overall mortality. Low health literacy has been associated with limitations in instrumental activities of daily living, activities of daily living, and limitations in activity because of physical health. The proposed study will determine whether a low-cost automated system that can be easily deployed from ambulatory clinics will be effective in motivating older adults with low literacy to obtain more physical activity.           ",Computer Agents to Promote Walking in Older Adults with Low Health Literacy,7888141,R01AG028668,"['Behavior ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' behavior change ', ' gaze ', ' experience ', ' Population Study ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Walking ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' touchscreen ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' Minority ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Cues ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' IADL ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' Population Research ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Behavioral ', ' Comprehension ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Gestures ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Indigent ', ' Interview ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' literacy ', ' Loneliness ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' satisfaction ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Simulate ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Urban Population ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' group intervention ', ' standard of care ', ' health information technology ', ' arm ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2010,613872,-0.008900935858021309
"Enhancing Motivation for Physical Activity to Reduce the Risk of Falls    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unintentional falls among community-dwelling older adults are a common, serious and potentially preventable public health problem. In the United States, the annual incidence of fall related injuries per 100,000 persons was 4616 in 2001, rising to 5252 in 2008. The annual incidence of fall related deaths per 100,000 persons was 29.3 in 2000, rising to 41.86 in 2006. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to falls as they age. The consequences of falls are significant to both individuals and communities exerting a negative impact on the health of older adult populations. Potential consequences include fractures, fear of falling, emergency room, hospital and nursing home admissions, dependence, confusion, immobilization, depression, and death. Significant modifiable fall risk factors include muscle weakness, gait problems, and balance problems. While researchers have demonstrated the positive effects of fall preventive physical activity, the majority of older adults remain sedentary and the rate of falls continues to increase. Older adults participate in regular physical activity and fitness activities less often than younger populations; disparities are greater among older adults who are poor and living in rural communities. While knowledge about causes, risk factors, and efficacious physical activity to prevent falls has grown exponentially in the last several decades, bridging the gap between research and practice continues to be a challenge. As a strategy to address the gap between research and practice, the proposed study will utilize a tested theory, the wellness motivation theory, to address behavioral change in combination with instruction for physical activity. The target population of the proposed pilot intervention study includes rural community dwelling older adults, an understudied population in this field. Innovative measures of fall risk (balance) and physical activity patterning will include an accelerometer with remote sensitivity. Primary aims of the proposed pilot study include (a) examining acceptability and feasibility of the wellness motivation intervention, and (b) pilot testing the efficacy of the wellness motivation intervention to increase contextual resources, behavioral change process variables, the behavioral outcome of physical activity, and health outcome of fall risk reduction (increased balance and strength). The proposed study is the first step in a program of research focusing on the prevention of falls and frailty among older adults.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unintentional falls among community-dwelling older adults are a common, serious, and potentially preventable public health problem. Researchers have demonstrated the positive effects of physical activity to prevent falls, yet the majority of older adults do not engage in everyday physical activity behaviors. The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to examine the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of an intervention that utilizes a behavioral change theory (the wellness motivation theory) to promote the adoption and maintenance of physical activities that reduce falls among rural community-dwelling older adults.           Project Narrative  Unintentional falls among community-dwelling older adults are a common, serious, and potentially preventable public health problem.

"Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Deep South RCMAR will serve as research-based and mentoring investment in the process of closing the health disparities gap between African American and non-minority older adults. In addition, the Deep South RCMAR will increase the number of researchers with the capacity to conduct independent, peer-reviewed research related to minority aging and health disparities. The RCMAR will focus on health problems that are particularly prevalent among older African Americans, and will give special attention to issues related to rural elders; intervention research addressing exercise, diet, or preventive health strategies; and studies addressing socio-economic, discrimination, trust, and bioethical issues impacting both measures of both physical and mental health. The Deep South RCMAR will create research infrastructure for the following objectives: (1) establish a mechanism for mentoring research careers; (2) enhance cultural diversity of the professional workforce conducting research on the health of older persons; (3) conduct research on and disseminate strategies for recruiting and retaining African American older adults in research; (4) facilitate innovative strategies to support enduring research careers in minority health, and/or encourage the recruitment of established researchers to undertake research on minority aging health; (5) improve the research methods and tools necessary to conduct rigorous and comparable research on diverse populations; (6) advance scientific knowledge leading to a decrease in health disparities; and (7) disseminate to scientific and non-scientific communities research results addressing the resolution of health disparities through the improvement of minority health, particularly for older African Americans. The Deep South RCMAR will be composed of three interacting and collaborative cores (administration, investigator development, and community liaison) created by and built upon the unique strengths of four partnering institutions (Morehouse School of Medicine, Tuskegee University, University of Alabama, and University of Alabama at Birmingham). The cores will provide an infrastructure to provide training and mentoring programs, fund three pilot projects per year, and nurture community relations needed to meet the stated objectives.

"Prevention of HIV/AIDS and STDs in Women over Fifty    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NOT-OD-10-034: NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications for Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Transfer Technology Research Grants through the NIH Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet). Abstract: HIV infection is on the rise among older women in the U.S. There is an urgent need for culturally-sensitive, gender-specific, and age-appropriate HIV prevention interventions for older women, particularly minority older women who are most at-risk - a need that is disturbingly unmet. The need to overcome stigma and privacy barriers to HIV/AIDS/STD education in this group, combined with the explosive growth in the number of wired seniors, including minority seniors, makes an e-intervention an ideal delivery method for addressing this problem, and for addressing ethnic disparities in HIV infection rates among older women. Our overall goal in the Phase 1 parent grant is to develop a comprehensive (educational and behavioral), tailored, accessible, and innovative HIV/AIDs and STD prevention e- intervention for culturally-diverse older women age 50 and over. Based on Phase 1 focus group findings, we now propose revising the site as conceived of in the parent grant to include 3 brief videos of an older woman discussing how she successfully negotiated a safe sex challenge. Recent CDC research shows brief videos can positively impact STD prevention, especially among older adults. Specific Phase 1 Aims from the parent grant are:1) Develop a prototype website for a risk reduction e- intervention for culturally-diverse older women, incorporating a peer chatroom and ask the expert segment; 2) Collect pilot data to develop an individually tailored online coaching component to be incorporated into the Phase 2 site; 3) Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and immediate effectiveness of the Phase 1 site for increasing knowledge and perceived risks; and, 4) Prepare for the Phase 2 application with respect to functional expansion, evaluation, and commercialization of the website. In this revision, Specific Aim #1 from the parent grant will be expanded as follows: 1) Develop a prototype website for a risk reduction e-intervention for culturally-diverse older women, incorporating peer chatroom, ask the expert, and brief video segments. Specific Aims for the proposed revision are: 1) Research, film, and edit 3 brief videos of an older woman (including minority) discussing how she successfully negotiated a real-life safe sex challenge 2) Evaluate feasibility & effectiveness of the website including 3 brief videos at increasing user safe sex self efficacy and HIV knowledge 3) Prepare for Phase 2 re: inclusion, refinement, and expansion of brief videos.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV infection rates are rising among older women, particularly African American women, creating a public health imperative for culturally-sensitive and gender-specific HIV/STD prevention interventions for older women. In Phase 1 of the parent grant, we are developing the first comprehensive (educational and behavioral), tailored, accessible, and innovative STD/HIV prevention e-intervention for culturally-diverse older women. In the proposed revision, we aim to create and test a brief video component for the website, which is based on our focus group findings, and supported by CDC research. We expect the added component will enhance the impact of the site on older women's safe sex self-efficacy and HIV knowledge, as well as contribute to consumer appeal.             HIV infection rates are rising among older women, particularly African American women, creating a public health imperative for culturally-sensitive and gender-specific HIV/STD prevention interventions for older women.

"Psychological Well Being and Recovery Among Older Hospitalized Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposed study addresses the Program Announcement entitled ""Research on Mind-Body Interactions and Health"" (PA-07-046). Specifically, we address the National Institute on Aging (NIA) interest in exploring associations between psychological well-being and functional ability in older adults hospitalized for acute illness. The Specific Aims of the proposed application are to: 1. Examine change in functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. Functional status will be assessed by a battery of measures (a 4 meter walk, a test of grip strength, knee extensor strength and seven activities of daily living (ADLs)) at 5 time points: within 24 hours of hospital admission and discharge, and 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge. 2. Examine direct and indirect associations between psychological well-being and functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. Psychological well-being, assessed by a 6- domain psychological well-being instrument and a positive affect summary scale, will be used to examine patterns of association with functional status over the 5 time points outlined in aim 1. 3. Examine whether psychological well-being modifies ethnic health disparities associated with functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. This aim will allow us to examine how ethnic group (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics) interacts with psychological well-being to influence functional status over the 5 time points outlined in aim 1. To explore our aims, we plan to follow up an ethnically diverse sample of 800 older patients (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics) admitted to the Acute Care for Elders (ACE) unit at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Older adults enrolled in the study will be assessed at five time points: within 24 hours of hospital admission, within 24 hours of hospital discharge and 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge. The five time points will allow us not only to examine overall patterns of effect between functional status and psychological well-being but it will also allow us to examine patterns of effect over distinct time periods including hospitalization and post discharge. The three post discharge follow up interviews will further allow us to examine and explain associations between functional status and psychological well-being in relation to short (1 month) and longer term (6 and 12 month) recovery patterns.

"Racial Disparities in Heart Attack Recovery: Role of Stress and Stigma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), older African Americans tend to have significantly worse functional recovery and higher mortality rates than same-aged Whites. Race differences in older individuals' cardiovascular outcomes remain after adjusting for factors that traditionally have been used to explain this disparity, such as socioeconomic status and access to health care. Our overall goal is to examine whether this racial disparity in older individuals' AMI-recovery outcomes is partially explained by the combined influence of age stigma and race stigma, both of which can generate stress.       Based on our pilot data, the stigma literature, and Rutter's theory of cumulative risk, we will examine the following hypotheses for the first time: (1) African Americans and Whites with greater age stigma will have worse functional recovery; (2) Age stigma's deleterious influence on functional recovery will be greater among African Americans than Whites; (3) Among African Americans, (a) those with greater age stigma and race stigma will have worse functional recovery, and (b) age stigma and race stigma will act in a synergistic way to worsen functional recovery; and (4) Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction will mediate the process by which (a) age stigma impacts the functional recovery of African Americans and Whites, and (b) race stigma impacts the functional recovery of African Americans.       The secondary aim of the proposed study is to identify methods to help older persons recovering from an AMI cope with age stigma and race stigma. We will focus on coping strategies that may be amenable to future interventions.       Using a prospective, longitudinal design, our interdisciplinary team will assess 200 African Americans and 200 Whites, aged 50 and over, within a week of hospital admission following an AMI, and assess them again one month, four months, eight months, and twelve months later. Functional recovery will be assessed by physical performance over time. The mediator, ANS dysfunction, will be measured by 24-hour heart-rate variability and acute response to laboratory stressors. Secondary outcomes consist of depression, cognitive functioning, and adverse cardiovascular events. Relevant covariates will be included in analyses, such as age, AMI severity, and depression.       This study is responsive to PA-05-029,  Societal and Cultural Dimensions of Health,  because we will examine how the societal construct of stigma influences AMI recovery. Additionally, the study fits the NHLBI Strategy for Addressing Health Disparities which includes identifying psychosocial mechanisms that contribute to the progression of diseases that disproportionately affect minorities. The proposed research could illuminate an unexplored mechanism that enable stigmas to worsen health. In addition, it could lay the groundwork for future interventions to improve the AMI-recovery experience of older persons in general and African American older persons in particular.      Public Health Relevance: The worse recovery of older African Americans following a heart attack has been a persistent public-health problem. We expect to show how a previously unexplored psychological factor, in combination with a physical factor, contributes to the disparity between African American and White recovery. Further, our research could lay the groundwork for future cost-effective procedures to improve heart attack recovery of older persons in general and African American older persons in particular.          ",Racial Disparities in Heart Attack Recovery: Role of Stress and Stigma,7880003,R01HL089314,"['social ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Hospitals ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' racism ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Laboratory Finding ', ' Lab Findings ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Literature ', ' Ageism ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Exposure to ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stigmata ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Stress ', ' cognitive function ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Belief ', ' psychosocial ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Glossary ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' heart rate variability ', ' longitudinal design ', ' ']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,771250,0.04286844078494607
"PENN RCMAR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Schools of Medicine and Nursing of the University of Pennsylvania propose a new Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR): ""Reducing Health Disparities Across the Stages of Illness in Older Minority Populations with Chronic Disease."" The RCMAR will collaborate with community stakeholders through established research partnerships, and with internal and external institutions and programs that have an established track record of interdisciplinary, health disparities and aging research, and experience mentoring junior investigators and minority investigators. The proposed Center activities are contained in four cores: Administrative, Investigator Development, Community Liaison, and Measurement. The investigator core faculty are leaders in disparities and aging research in the clinical, social, behavioral, epidemiology, and health services fields. The Measurement Core faculty provide consultative expertise in an array of methodological issues pertinent to disparities research: data collection (qualitative and mixed methods) and instrument development, study design and sampling, secondary data analysis, and translation of evidence to communities through participatory research partnerships. The Community Liaison Core will advance the science of community engagement in research, inclusive of but not restricted to recruitment. The principal goals of the Penn RCMAR are to: 1) Conduct research across the stages of chronic illness with the aim of improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities in minority older adults. We aim to specify and evaluate diverse variables (individual, social, economic, health systems, family, and community) and their relationship to health care delivery (access and quality) and health outcomes across various stages of illness; 2) Design and test interventions at the patient, provider, organizational, and environmental levels that reduce health disparities in minority older adults; 3) Train and mentor diverse investigators to undertake health disparities research in these populations; 4) Prepare a wide range of community organizations and stakeholders to participate actively in the design and conduct of research and the dissemination of results. The RCMAR is characterized by an interdisciplinary senior faculty, and prominent minority leadership and participation. In year one, four pilots are proposed in the local community: 1) perceived future needs for transition to a nursing home, 2) spirituality in persons with hypertension, 3) exercise post breast cancer treatment, and 4) sleep perception and significance.

"Mechanisms of health disparities in parkinsonism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for an NIA Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development (K23) award seeks support to develop a program of research related to understanding the mechanisms of health disparities in Parkinsonism. As part of the education plan, the PI proposes to: 1) Increase her understanding of health behavior theory, geriatrics and health disparities; 2) Gain additional epidemiological skills in study design and health measurement; and 3) Acquire the analytic skills associated with psychometric and longitudinal data analysis. Along with these educational goals, there is an associated research project.  The principal research objective of this project is to understand the patient-level factors related to healthcare disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinsonian signs. Specifically, this study proposes to evaluate how older adults' aging beliefs affect the recognition of Parkinsonian signs, and how race, culture and socioeconomic status impact this relationship. To achieve these goals, there are three specific aims: 1) To validate a screening instrument for Parkinsonian signs by comparing it with neurological examination; 2) To examine older adults' beliefs regarding movement changes and their association with Parkinsonian signs and relevant patient-level characteristics; and 3) To determine the association between beliefs about aging, subsequent comorbidities, including falls and fractures, and the detection and treatment of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. After validation of a screening instrument for Parkinsonian signs, this measure will be incorporated into a cross-sectional and prospective evaluation of the relationship between aging beliefs and Parkinsonian signs, particularly as it is modified by socioeconomic factors. Subjects will be recruited and surveyed in primary care clinics and outcomes will be determined through the electronic health record. Successful completion of this project will lead to the development of educational interventions targeting improved understanding of aging related functional decline among older adults. This application will provide critical support for the PI to become an independent researcher and a leader in health services research in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aging-related movement problems are common in older adults and lead to increased disability and death.

"Organizational Variability and Racial Disparities in Hospice Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  My goal is to become an academic geriatrician focused on reducing disparities in end-of-life care. I have already initiated this career plan through completion of a Master of Health Sciences and research examining cultural attitudes and beliefs which may impact hospice use by older African Americans. With this award, I would acquire additional training in health disparities research. My research and career development plan will be overseen by mentors with research expertise in end-of-life care and content expertise related to the care of African Americans with life-limiting illness. Compared to Caucasians, African Americans are more likely to experience poor quality healthcare at the end of life. Also, studies document lower rates of hospice use among older African Americans. Because hospice is currently the most effective model for care at the end of life, increasing hospice use by older African Americans may reduce racial disparities in end-of-life care. To date, no research has evaluated the association between the organizational characteristics of hospices and disparities in their service to older African Americans and Caucasians. This research will test the hypothesis that racial disparities in hospice use are associated with variability in the structure, programs, and policies of individual hospice agencies. The specific aims are to: (1) Describe hospice-level variability in disparities in service to older African Americans and Caucasians; (2) Describe hospice-level variability in structure, programs, and policies which may influence hospice use by African Americans; (3) Identify organizational characteristics that facilitate the use of hospice by African Americans. This research will include: an analysis of Medicare Claims Data and a comprehensive database of the characteristics of hospices throughout North and South Carolina; and a survey and qualitative interview with hospice providers in the two states. The findings of this work will inform the development of organizational-level interventions to increase hospice use by older African Americans and eliminate racial disparities throughout the life course.

"Disability, Illness Burden, and Transitions of Care to Cardiac Rehabilitation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, disparities exist in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) use as services are underutilized by older adults, women, and minorities, especially those who use post-hospital services. Older adults are a group that we know can benefit from formal CR; yet they do not use it. Formal CR must be used by older adults so that they can receive the documented benefits. The proposed study is significant because it will describe the continuum of cardiac care, expand our knowledge of why older adults do not receive out-patient CR services beyond the known factors of age, gender, race, and location, and will examine the effect of clinical factors not traditionally considered. These clinical factors include disability and illness burden (i.e., illness severity, comorbidity, complications, treatment, and rehabilitation contraindications). Many of these clinical variables can be modified and thus we can improve disability so that it no longer acts as a barrier to older adults participation in CR affording them the benefits of participation. The identification of the specific components of illness burden will provide insight into the unique needs of older adults after a cardiac event. In addition, time to CR service use is not known and may vary for reasons related to disability and illness burden. Identifying time to CR service use may reinforce the need to implement a care path that reinforces a smooth continuum of care that will impact the high rehospitalization rates. The clinical application of the information gained from this study will assist in the development of targeted interventions to increase formal CR use and to integrate CR principles into post-hospital services, to better meet the unique needs of older adults. If the present study identifies that disability is a factor in older MI patients' under-utilization of out-patient CR (and not just age, gender, and race), then earlier interventions to reduce disability can be implemented. Earlier interventions based on CR principles can be integrated into post-hospital care to optimize recovery for older adults. This study is innovative in that it challenges the current model of CR developed in the 1970s to prepare middle aged males to return to work following a MI. Despite the changing demographics of cardiac patients (older, sicker, and more women), the current CR model and reimbursement structure have not changed in 35 years. Medicare still reimburses only for formal out-patient CR. If findings from the present study indicate that disability, illness severity, comorbidity and complications are high and rehabilitation contraindications low in patients using post-hospital services, changes to the current CR service reimbursement structure can be considered to provide CR care principles during hospitalization and post-hospital care in addition to those offered in formal out-patient CR. This type of change will assure that a continuum of CR services is delivered as is recommended by the AACVPR. The proposed study will provide initial evidence of the need to consider changes to this policy to include MI patients.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Disability, Illness Burden, and Transitions of Care to CR Reduction of disability is important to older adults as physical function is integral to independence in activities of daily living, involvement in social activities, and quantity of quality life years. Fifty percent of older adults after an MI use traditional post-hospital services and 19% are rehospitalized in the first 30 days. Post-hospital services do not include cardiac rehabilitation (CR) principles for patients post-MI. CR principles are delivered in the outpatient setting 4 to 6 weeks after MI for those who enroll in this service. Understanding relationships among disability, illness burden, use of CR, and time to CR use by older persons after an MI in those using post-hospital services when compared to those who do not use post-hospital services will help us to recognize and overcome barriers to the continuum of cardiac care and frequent rehospitalizations.           Public Health Relevance Statement Disability, Illness Burden, and Transitions of Care to CR Reduction of disability is important to older adults as physical function is integral to independence in activities of daily living, involvement in social activities, and quantity of quality life years.

"Impact of Medicare Part D on Racial Disparities in Diabetes Treatment and Outcome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many older adults respond to high out-of-pocket drug costs by skipping, reducing dosages of or not filling prescriptions for their medications. A primary goal of the new Medicare drug benefit (Part D) was to increase the availability of drug coverage and thereby improve medication use among older adults. Medicare Part D may have a disproportionate impact on medication use among beneficiaries in minority groups. For instance, African American beneficiaries have enrolled in Part D in greater numbers (62% vs. 48%) than Caucasian beneficiaries. Moreover, African American beneficiaries are more likely than Caucasian beneficiaries to qualify for generous Part D low-income subsidies. As a result, Part D may help to alleviate racial/ethnic disparities in clinical processes of care and health outcomes that have been documented for a range of chronic conditions   among older adults. We will assess the impact of Part D on racial disparities in medication use and health outcomes for older adults with diabetes, a chronic condition with increasing prevalence. Given the worse glycemic control and higher diabetes-related mortality among African Americans compared to Caucasians, our proposed investigations have critical implications for health disparities. The long-term objective of our proposed study is to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in health by examining the impact of changes in insurance coverage among the elderly. This proposal has two primary objectives. First, we will assess racial differences in antidiabetic medication use, glycemic control, and diabetes-related hospitalizations and mortality for an elderly cohort with diabetes before the implementation of Part D. We hypothesize that older African American beneficiaries with diabetes will have lower levels of antidiabetic medication use, worse glycemic control, and higher diabetes-related hospitalization and mortality rates compared to Caucasian beneficiaries. Second, we will examine whether Part D mitigates racial disparities in medication use, glycemic control, and diabetes-related hospitalizations and mortality in the elderly. We hypothesize that older African Americans compared to Caucasians will experience a larger improvement in medication use, glycemic control, and diabetes-related hospitalizations and mortality. Our study will use longitudinal data from an 11-year, Medicare population-based prospective cohort study. We will adjust our estimates of the effect of race and Part D for socioeconomic status, comorbidities, health, functional and cognitive status, access to care, and other factors. Our research has important policy implications. Medicare Part D -- the most substantial expansion of insurance benefits to older adults since the program's inception over 40 years ago -- is projected to cost just under $1 trillion between 2007 and 2017. If Medicare Part D reduces racial disparities in medication access, our study will inform other efforts to expand insurance coverage to vulnerable populations. Our multidisciplinary research team has extensive experience conducting health policy analyses, pharmacoepidemiologic studies with geriatric populations, health disparities and diabetes research, and is uniquely positioned to shed light on this critical policy issue.             ",Impact of Medicare Part D on Racial Disparities in Diabetes Treatment and Outcome,7938793,R01HS017695,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2010,232658,0.04968621843607962

"Cost-related Underuse of Medications and the Health of Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cost-related Medication Nonadherence and the Health of Older Adults Becky Briesacher, Ph.D., is a health services researcher and Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently-funded researcher supported by rich mentorship and fruitful collaborations in the area of aging and drug policy. Dr. Briesacher seeks a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) to gain: (1) a better understanding of cost-related medication nonadherence (CRN) and its effect on the health of older adults, and (2) research experience with models that account for irrationality in health behaviors. The candidate proposes a career development plan that provides new training in behavioral economics, targeted exposure to clinical geriatrics, and advanced statistical methods in longitudinal analyses. The research program includes: (1) creating a unique, longitudinal dataset from two national health surveys of older adults, (2) describing the longitudinal course of CRN, including identifying the predictors and potential consequences on patient health and health care expenditures, and (3) developing models of CRN in older adults that incorporate principles from behavioral economics, particularly time-inconsistency. The advanced training and three-part research program will provide the foundation for Dr. Briesacher's transition to an independent investigator in geriatric health services research. In addition, this research program will inform issues central to Medicare Part D prescription drug program and its effects on the health and financial stability of older adults. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Strong evidence shows that medication adherence decreases with higher cost-sharing, yet medication cost- sharing is rising, most notably in Medicare Part D. Discovering how optimal cost-sharing may improve medication adherence has significant implications for the health and welfare of an aging society that is increasingly dependent on medications.           ",Cost-related Underuse of Medications and the Health of Older Adults,7904752,K01AG031836,"['improved ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services for the Aged ', ' health services for seniors ', ' health services for older people ', ' health services for older adults ', ' Health Services for the Elderly ', ' Geriatric Health Services ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Surveys ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Incentives ', ' inducement ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Lipids ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Collaborations ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Exposure to ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Social Welfare ', ' welfare ', ' Societies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Event ', ' Behavior ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Buffers ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Accounting ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Older Population ', ' Monitor ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' beneficiary ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' longitudinal course ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K01,2010,124940,0.12098206629909745
"Linking Personality and SES Influences on Lifespan Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this K08 Mentored Career Development Award application, Ben Chapman, PhD, a psychologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC), proposes to integrate approaches from personality psychology and social epidemiology to study socioeconomically (SES) based health disparities across the latter part of life. Proposed are a comprehensive educational plan, original data collection, and secondary analyses of existing datasets designed to equip the applicant to become a leading investigator of how the social stratification in lifespan health trajectories is influenced by individual personality. He will receive formal training in social epidemiology, health and aging, and multilevel statistics through formal coursework and mentored didactics with a team of nationally recognized experts in these areas. Dr. Chapman's research program proposes two scientific aims, based on a synthesis of theory and findings from social epidemiology and personality and health, under a conceptual framework of life course epidemiology. The Aims examine the interaction between personality and SES factors influencing health behaviors and general illness burden across the second half of life. New data collection focuses on how personality influences health under conditions of socioeconomic deprivation, involving 18-24 month follow up of a pilot cohort (N=106) of ethnically diverse, lower SES middle age and older adults currently being accrued. This will provide Dr. Chapman with valuable experience following a small cohort over a short time, in preparation for larger studies, and obtain health data rare in existing data sources, like inflammatory biomarkers. Existing data sources are selected for longitudinal information on personality, SES, and health, permitting well-powered hypothesis tests over the Midlife Development in the US, Hawaii Culture and Health, and Older Adults in Primary Care studies. From a public health view, lifespan health is powerfully tied to social inequalities; but not all disadvantaged people suffer worse, and not all advantaged people enjoy better health as they age. Attention to individual psychological and behavioral dispositions can aid understanding of this heterogeneity. Blending personality and social epidemiology will better illuminate the interface between person and social structure in healthy aging.           ",Linking Personality and SES Influences on Lifespan Health,7917285,K08AG031328,"['biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Resolution ', ' Stratification ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fellowship ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Grant ', ' Half-Life ', ' Hand ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 (B cell stimulating factor 2) ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' Training ', ' Personality Traits ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Individual ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Mentors ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Persons ', ' Personality ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Shapes ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Adopted ', ' Attention ', ' Complex ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Behavior ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' social inequality ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' deprivation ', ' theories ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' healthy aging ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K08,2010,124897,0.022008744314536526
"CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This is a new application for Phase I of the Community Network Program (CNP) RFA.  The purpose is to propose an active and comprehensive community-based program to reduce disparities of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in metropolitan Detroit.  We propose to mobilize an intensive system of community-based participatory education, training, and research, given that data from our region demonstrate that older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of these cancers, are first diagnosed at later stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates.  The goal of our proposed CNP is to catalyze and sustain a strong community based movement to significantly improve access to and engagement of beneficial interventions to increase cancer screening and early stage detection, diagnosis and treatment.  This RFA affords a most important and unique opportunity for researchers and clinicians at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI), the Institute of Gerontology (IOG) and the Center for Urban and African American Health (CUAAH), all at Wayne State University, to combine our expertise and community contacts to create a vibrant and comprehensive community participatory education, training and behavioral research program.  We are located in downtown Detroit, and our collective mission is to serve the health and welfare needs of our minority constituencies living in our socially and economically challenged urban neighborhoods.  The aim for the first year is to create enduring partnerships among community leaders, researchers and medical professionals to facilitate and sustain education, research and training programs that reduce disparities; the aim of the second year is to develop community-based participatory research and training projects to promote secondary prevention behaviors including early detection, treatment seeking and routine surveillance; and the aim for years 3-5 is to implement, evaluate and sustain interventions and research to eradicate cancer health disparities         ",CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults,8145001,U01CA114583,"['health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' training project ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Training ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Heart ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Institutes ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentorship ', ' Michigan ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Built Environment and Health Care Use: Disparities Among Chronically Ill Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Associations between characteristics of the neighborhoods in which older people live and late-life disparities in chronic illness have been the subject of a rapidly growing field of research. For low-income and minority elders with chronic illness, disparities in access to and quality of care contribute to disparities in the burden of illness. Research on chronic illness has also underscored the links between inadequate physician oversight, potentially preventable hospitalizations, and poor health outcomes. However, little is known about the ways in which neighborhood environmental factors - beyond local supply of medical services - inform how urban older adults with chronic illness use physician services to manage their health. This study addresses this gap by examining the relationships between neighborhood built environment (e.g. walk-ability, access to public transit), use of physician services, and preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits among elderly, chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries who live in New York City. Specifically, the study aims to:  1) Examine associations between neighborhood built environment and physician service use among  urban, chronically ill older adults;  2) Determine whether and to what extent variations in the built environment influence potentially  preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits; and  3) Reassess findings from Aims 1 and 2 by applying: (i) alternative modeling techniques; and (ii) tests of  endogeneity to address the potential sorting of patients into neighborhoods with different characteristics  based on service use and outcomes.  The study will be based on longitudinal analysis of existing data on a sample of NYC-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older, linking individual characteristics and service use measures with small area- level data from other sources. Analyses will focus on patients with congestive heart failure and diabetes - two major contributors to preventable hospitalizations. This study will provide insight into the interdependence of clinical, social, economic, and environmental factors that influence quality of chronic illness care and, ultimately, quality of life, for older adults with multiple co-morbidities. The proposed research will apply and expand on the candidate's training throughout the K01 award period, including advanced methodological training in epidemiology and health economics. The training and research activities will lay the foundation for an R01 application in the later years of the award. Findings from this study and future research will ultimately be applied toward developing effective interventions to improve access to, continuity, and quality of ambulatory care for chronically ill elders living in underserved communities and, in turn, mitigate late-life health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significant socio-economic and racial/ethnic disparities exist in the burden of chronic illness among older adults, due partly to disparities in access to and quality of ambulatory care aimed at preventing chronic illness complications. Although prior research has examined geographic variations in health care access across areas such as counties, little is known about how variations in environmental and socio-economic factors at the neighborhood level influence disparities in service use and outcomes among vulnerable groups, particularly low-income and minority elders. This study aims to address this gap by examining the relationships between neighborhood built environment, use of physician services, and preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits among elderly, chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries who live in New York City.              Significant socio-economic and racial/ethnic disparities exist in the burden of chronic illness among older adults, due partly to disparities in access to and quality of ambulatory care aimed at preventing chronic illness complications.

"Cost-related Underuse of Medications and the Health of Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cost-related Medication Nonadherence and the Health of Older Adults Becky Briesacher, Ph.D., is a health services researcher and Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently-funded researcher supported by rich mentorship and fruitful collaborations in the area of aging and drug policy. Dr. Briesacher seeks a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) to gain: (1) a better understanding of cost-related medication nonadherence (CRN) and its effect on the health of older adults, and (2) research experience with models that account for irrationality in health behaviors. The candidate proposes a career development plan that provides new training in behavioral economics, targeted exposure to clinical geriatrics, and advanced statistical methods in longitudinal analyses. The research program includes: (1) creating a unique, longitudinal dataset from two national health surveys of older adults, (2) describing the longitudinal course of CRN, including identifying the predictors and potential consequences on patient health and health care expenditures, and (3) developing models of CRN in older adults that incorporate principles from behavioral economics, particularly time-inconsistency. The advanced training and three-part research program will provide the foundation for Dr. Briesacher's transition to an independent investigator in geriatric health services research. In addition, this research program will inform issues central to Medicare Part D prescription drug program and its effects on the health and financial stability of older adults. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Strong evidence shows that medication adherence decreases with higher cost-sharing, yet medication cost- sharing is rising, most notably in Medicare Part D. Discovering how optimal cost-sharing may improve medication adherence has significant implications for the health and welfare of an aging society that is increasingly dependent on medications.           ",Cost-related Underuse of Medications and the Health of Older Adults,8119422,K01AG031836,"['Massachusetts ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services for the Aged ', ' health services for seniors ', ' health services for older people ', ' health services for older adults ', ' Health Services for the Elderly ', ' Geriatric Health Services ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Incentives ', ' inducement ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' longitudinal course ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' aged ', ' Economics ', ' professor ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' career development ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Event ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Training ', ' career ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Services ', ' Exposure to ', ' Area ', ' Foundations ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Reporting ', ' Monitor ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lipids ', ' improved ', ' Accounting ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Mentorship ', ' skills ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Recommendation ', ' Societies ', ' Structure ', ' Risk ', ' Health ', ' Time ', ' Outcome ', ' Literature ', ' experience ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Clinical ', ' Research ', ' Policies ', ' Medicine ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Address ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Collaborations ', ' Affect ', ' Modeling ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Behavior ', ' Aging ', ' Patients ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Knowledge ', ' Caring ', ' Funding ', ' Health behavior ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Individual ', ' Instruction ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' programs ', ' Future ', ' cost ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Development Plans ', ' Buffers ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Universities ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Older Population ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' beneficiary ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Social Welfare ', ' welfare ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Retirement ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K01,2011,124940,0.12098206629909745
"Costa Rican Health and Retirement Survey    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application proposes to field two waves of a new, nationally representative longitudinal Costa Rican Health and Retirement Survey targeting Costa Rican adults near retirement age, born 1945-1955. This would complement an on-going longitudinal household survey of older Costa Ricans born before 1945 (CRELES). A number of factors make Costa Rica an important site for the study of older adults' health and economic status: (a) Costa Rica has higher life expectancy than even the United States, with lower age-specific mortality rates among adults. The proposed data would allow unique new insight into life-course social and economic determinants of Costa Rica's success, as well as investigation of the bi-directional relationships between health and work among older adults in this exemplar population. (b) Past work has found Costa Rica to have unusually small socioeconomic gradients in health and economic well-being. This project is designed to allow deeper exploration of the role of public and private support underlying these remarkable inequality patterns. (c) Costa Rica experienced one of the earliest and fastest fertility transitions in the developing world, with total fertility dropping from 7.3 births in 1960 to 3.7 by 1976. By focusing on the parental cohorts experiencing this decline, this survey can uniquely advance understanding of the long- term demographic dividends of fertility decline. (d) Costa Rica provides a particularly rich study setting due to the ability to retrospectively and prospectively link the proposed microdata with high quality registries of vital events such as deaths, creating the ability to follow the sampled cohort at low cost indefinitely into the future. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed project would generate a unique new dataset for studying the determinants of longevity in a country considered a success story for having achieved ""good health at low cost."" Furthermore, it would enable detailed study of social and economic conditions surrounding retirement in a country on the leading edge of the aging transition in Latin America.             ",Costa Rican Health and Retirement Survey,8106128,R01AG031716,"['Costa Rican ', ' Labor Forces ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Fertility ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' health economics ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Social Network ', ' Consumption ', ' Reliance ', ' Drops ', ' Household ', ' Registries ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Economics ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Stress ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Aging ', ' Health Insurance ', ' International ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Investigation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Interview ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' male ', ' Salivary ', ' Country ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' experience ', ' Age ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Funding ', ' United States ', ' Population ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Measurement ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Work ', ' Pattern ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Risk ', ' Environment ', ' Site ', ' insight ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Sampling ', ' expectation ', ' Health ', ' Future ', ' Data ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' social ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' cost ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' success ', ' Event ', ' Accounting ', ' Individual ', ' Questionnaires ', ' biomarker ', ' Link ', ' cohort ', ' Pensions ', ' Retirement Benefits ', ' glycosylated hemoglobin C ', ' glycosylated Hb C ', ' Costa Rica ', ' Inequality ', ' Intergenerational transfer ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Latin America ', ' social model ', ' Mexican ', ' Social Welfare ', ' welfare ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Retirement ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Insurance ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2011,279066,0.04997437097730339
"Ideal Affect and Health Decision Making Across the Lifespan    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the number of minorities and older adults in the U.S. increase, it is increasingly important to reduce health care disparities among these groups. Recent reports have shown that ethnic disparities in health care utilization, such as successful patient-physician communication and engagement in preventative behaviors, are especially critical for older adults. Optimal health care depends on whether an individual chooses to follow their doctors' recommendations, adhere to prescribed treatments, and engage in health promotion programs. Understanding cultural and age-related differences in how these choices are made can help to reduce disparities in health care. The proposed program of research will test applications of Affect Valuation Theory (AVT) as a theoretical foundation for understanding cultural and age-related differences in how health care decisions are made. AVT suggests that variation in ""ideal affect"" (i.e., the affective states that people value) may contribute to cultural and age-related differences in health care decisions. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) Examine the relationship between ideal affect and health care decisions; and (2) Determine whether cultural and age-related differences in ideal affect may in part account for differences in health care decisions. Using both survey and experimental methods, we will investigate the relationship between ideal affect and health decision making across the life span for two distinct cultural groups, European American and Chinese American. First, we will measure how ideal affect influences health care decision making among participants ranging in age from 21 to 80. Then, we will manipulate ideal affect and subsequently assess preferences for health care options. Findings from these studies will establish the role of ideal affect and health care decision making as a potential mechanism for explaining ethnic health disparities across the life span.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By understanding how ideal affect influences decision making across age and cultural groups, the proposed research will help to develop more culturally sensitive and appropriate treatments and interventions. Thus, integrating ideal affect into the improvement of health care programs may address the needs of diverse populations more adequately.           ",Ideal Affect and Health Decision Making Across the Lifespan,8049155,F31AG032199,"['Play ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Age ', ' Reporting ', ' Behavior ', ' Foundations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Address ', ' Patients ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' American ', ' Shapes ', ' European ', ' theories ', ' public health relevance ', ' programs ', ' Medical ', ' Affect ', ' Individual ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Accounting ', ' Methods ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Time ', ' Physicians ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Measures ', ' Health ', ' Communication ', ' Participant ', ' Aerobic ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Chinese American ', ' Asian Americans ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' infection with HBV ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Music ', ' healthy aging ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Ethnic group ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Woman ', ' Affective ', ' disability ', ' Recommendation ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Minority ', ' Health behavior ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' evidence base ', ' Walking ', ' preference ', ' Provider ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mtb infection [{C0041296}] ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Arousal ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' Decision Making ', ' ']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2011,41800,0.05976675942842003
"Effects of Employment on Health and Quality of Life in Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People over 65 years old (65+) are the fastest growing group in the US population, and workers 65+ are increasing in number much more rapidly than any other worker age group. By year 2012, workers 65+ are estimated to comprise 16.7% of US labor force. This group of elderly workers is highly diverse (e.g. racial/ethnic and socio-economic status composition), yet their health status is only beginning to be characterized. Furthermore, careful examination of health-related quality of life of the older worker has been virtually ignored by the occupational health/aging research community. Finally, there has been no systematic research into variations in healthcare costs and utilization in this population, despite systemic concern over rising healthcare costs in the United States. This study proposes to use the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to study the health status, medical expenditures, healthcare utilization, and quality of life of employed older adults. Both datasets contain large representative samples of US adults 65+ (n=386,887 and n=17,396). Both descriptive and analytic modeling are proposed within a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework, taking into account socio-economic determinants of health such as occupational segregation and occupational prestige. The study proposes to:1) characterize health disparities, morbidity, health behaviors and conditions, and health-related quality of life of US workers and non-workers 65+ stratified by age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, health insurance, occupational segregation and prestige, employment status and occupational/industry categories; 2) using SEM, identify sociodemographic and occupational factors (including occupational prestige and segregation) associated with healthcare utilization and expenditures by workers 65+ after adjustment for health behavior, morbidity and health conditions; and 3) using SEM, predict the health- related quality of life in sub-populations of workers 65+ after adjustment for health behavior, morbidity and health conditions. This study is relevant to four out of five National Institute on Aging (NIA) research goals, including: (1) understanding of disease and disability in older adults; (2) aiding in developing interventions to improve their health and quality of life; (3) understanding the implications of an aging society; and (4) identification of health disparities and interventions to decrease these disparities. The findings of the proposed study can be used by policy makers, employers, and other stakeholders to make health-related and employment-related decisions and implement workplace changes and health promotion programs targeting the senior community in order to improve well-being and quality of life of people 65+.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adults over 65 years old who remain employed past retirement age constitute a rapidly growing and a highly diverse proportion of US older adults, however their health status, healthcare expenditures, and quality of life are only beginning to be characterized.

"Aging and Place: Neighborhoods and Health in a World Growing Older    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are living in a unique time in the history of the world.  Three trends will have profound implications for how we live. The trends are: 1) the aging of the world's population; 2) the aging of the aged; and 3) the concentration of the worlds' older people in urban areas.  Specifically, in the United States (US), the number of people aged 65 and older will more than double from 2000 to 2030.  All over the world, people prefer to ""age in place,"" remain in their homes and neighborhoods as long as possible. The challenge for our time is to create and maintain environments which support people to age in place, as their health changes and their physical capacity declines.  There is growing attention on neighborhood and place influences on health. Increasingly, the idea that neighborhoods affect health is accepted among researchers and policymakers. The proposed two-day workshop will bring together experts in the field including behavioral scientists, health researchers, urban planners, geographers, and architects to address these gaps and to stimulate new research.   This gathering will have three goals: (1) to bring together researchers in neighborhood influences on health in older adults, (2) to learn about current research and encourage research development in priority areas, and (3) to identify policy implications relevant to creating and maintaining age-friendly communities. The meeting will include both US and international perspectives. By bringing together experts and providing a forum for discussion, we have an opportunity to shape a research agenda to influence place-based policy strategies to improve health of older adults.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers in neighborhood influences on health in older adults to influence place-based policy strategies to improve health.                 The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers in neighborhood influences on health in older adults to influence place-based policy strategies to improve health.               ",Aging and Place: Neighborhoods and Health in a World Growing Older,8205105,R13AG039913,"['Policy Research ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' urban area ', ' policy implication ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Peer Review ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' Americas ', ' Physical Capacity ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Letters ', ' Physical environment ', ' Faculty ', ' aged ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Age ', ' social ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Health ', ' Reporting ', ' Population ', ' Address ', ' Affect ', ' editorial ', ' base ', ' theories ', ' Goals ', ' Scientist ', ' Area ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Environment ', ' Communities ', ' improved ', ' Event ', ' Genetic ', ' Life ', ' Attention ', ' Behavioral ', ' Learning ', ' United States ', ' Shapes ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Time ', ' Societies ', ' Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' trend ', ' Disease Progression ', ' meetings ', ' Marketing ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Universities ', ' programs ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Policies ', ' Minority ', ' disability ', ' Risk Factors ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Economics ', ' Publishing ', ' Newsletter ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' Interest Group ', ' International Perspectives ', ' Multinational Perspectives ', ' ']",NIA,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R13,2011,30000,0.02101566022603287
"Disability, Illness Burden, and Transitions of Care to Cardiac Rehabilitation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, disparities exist in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) use as services are underutilized by older adults, women, and minorities, especially those who use post-hospital services. Older adults are a group that we know can benefit from formal CR; yet they do not use it. Formal CR must be used by older adults so that they can receive the documented benefits. The proposed study is significant because it will describe the continuum of cardiac care, expand our knowledge of why older adults do not receive out-patient CR services beyond the known factors of age, gender, race, and location, and will examine the effect of clinical factors not traditionally considered. These clinical factors include disability and illness burden (i.e., illness severity, comorbidity, complications, treatment, and rehabilitation contraindications). Many of these clinical variables can be modified and thus we can improve disability so that it no longer acts as a barrier to older adults participation in CR affording them the benefits of participation. The identification of the specific components of illness burden will provide insight into the unique needs of older adults after a cardiac event. In addition, time to CR service use is not known and may vary for reasons related to disability and illness burden. Identifying time to CR service use may reinforce the need to implement a care path that reinforces a smooth continuum of care that will impact the high rehospitalization rates. The clinical application of the information gained from this study will assist in the development of targeted interventions to increase formal CR use and to integrate CR principles into post-hospital services, to better meet the unique needs of older adults. If the present study identifies that disability is a factor in older MI patients' under-utilization of out-patient CR (and not just age, gender, and race), then earlier interventions to reduce disability can be implemented. Earlier interventions based on CR principles can be integrated into post-hospital care to optimize recovery for older adults. This study is innovative in that it challenges the current model of CR developed in the 1970s to prepare middle aged males to return to work following a MI. Despite the changing demographics of cardiac patients (older, sicker, and more women), the current CR model and reimbursement structure have not changed in 35 years. Medicare still reimburses only for formal out-patient CR. If findings from the present study indicate that disability, illness severity, comorbidity and complications are high and rehabilitation contraindications low in patients using post-hospital services, changes to the current CR service reimbursement structure can be considered to provide CR care principles during hospitalization and post-hospital care in addition to those offered in formal out-patient CR. This type of change will assure that a continuum of CR services is delivered as is recommended by the AACVPR. The proposed study will provide initial evidence of the need to consider changes to this policy to include MI patients.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Disability, Illness Burden, and Transitions of Care to CR Reduction of disability is important to older adults as physical function is integral to independence in activities of daily living, involvement in social activities, and quantity of quality life years. Fifty percent of older adults after an MI use traditional post-hospital services and 19% are rehospitalized in the first 30 days. Post-hospital services do not include cardiac rehabilitation (CR) principles for patients post-MI. CR principles are delivered in the outpatient setting 4 to 6 weeks after MI for those who enroll in this service. Understanding relationships among disability, illness burden, use of CR, and time to CR use by older persons after an MI in those using post-hospital services when compared to those who do not use post-hospital services will help us to recognize and overcome barriers to the continuum of cardiac care and frequent rehospitalizations.           Public Health Relevance Statement Disability, Illness Burden, and Transitions of Care to CR Reduction of disability is important to older adults as physical function is integral to independence in activities of daily living, involvement in social activities, and quantity of quality life years.

"PENN RCMAR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Schools of Medicine and Nursing of the University of Pennsylvania propose a new Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR): ""Reducing Health Disparities Across the Stages of Illness in Older Minority Populations with Chronic Disease."" The RCMAR will collaborate with community stakeholders through established research partnerships, and with internal and external institutions and programs that have an established track record of interdisciplinary, health disparities and aging research, and experience mentoring junior investigators and minority investigators. The proposed Center activities are contained in four cores: Administrative, Investigator Development, Community Liaison, and Measurement. The investigator core faculty are leaders in disparities and aging research in the clinical, social, behavioral, epidemiology, and health services fields. The Measurement Core faculty provide consultative expertise in an array of methodological issues pertinent to disparities research: data collection (qualitative and mixed methods) and instrument development, study design and sampling, secondary data analysis, and translation of evidence to communities through participatory research partnerships. The Community Liaison Core will advance the science of community engagement in research, inclusive of but not restricted to recruitment. The principal goals of the Penn RCMAR are to: 1) Conduct research across the stages of chronic illness with the aim of improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities in minority older adults. We aim to specify and evaluate diverse variables (individual, social, economic, health systems, family, and community) and their relationship to health care delivery (access and quality) and health outcomes across various stages of illness; 2) Design and test interventions at the patient, provider, organizational, and environmental levels that reduce health disparities in minority older adults; 3) Train and mentor diverse investigators to undertake health disparities research in these populations; 4) Prepare a wide range of community organizations and stakeholders to participate actively in the design and conduct of research and the dissemination of results. The RCMAR is characterized by an interdisciplinary senior faculty, and prominent minority leadership and participation. In year one, four pilots are proposed in the local community: 1) perceived future needs for transition to a nursing home, 2) spirituality in persons with hypertension, 3) exercise post breast cancer treatment, and 4) sleep perception and significance. Each project investigative team combines faculty from medicine and nursing, and combines a junior trainee and a senior faculty.           ",PENN RCMAR,8090450,P30AG031043,[''],NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2011,846278,0.010804696574618527
"Impact of Medicare Part D on Racial Disparities in Diabetes Treatment and Outcome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many older adults respond to high out-of-pocket drug costs by skipping, reducing dosages of or not filling prescriptions for their medications. A primary goal of the new Medicare drug benefit (Part D) was to increase the availability of drug coverage and thereby improve medication use among older adults. Medicare Part D may have a disproportionate impact on medication use among beneficiaries in minority groups. For instance, African American beneficiaries have enrolled in Part D in greater numbers (62% vs. 48%) than Caucasian beneficiaries. Moreover, African American beneficiaries are more likely than Caucasian beneficiaries to qualify for generous Part D low-income subsidies. As a result, Part D may help to alleviate racial/ethnic disparities in clinical processes of care and health outcomes that have been documented for a range of chronic conditions   among older adults. We will assess the impact of Part D on racial disparities in medication use and health outcomes for older adults with diabetes, a chronic condition with increasing prevalence. Given the worse glycemic control and higher diabetes-related mortality among African Americans compared to Caucasians, our proposed investigations have critical implications for health disparities. The long-term objective of our proposed study is to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in health by examining the impact of changes in insurance coverage among the elderly. This proposal has two primary objectives. First, we will assess racial differences in antidiabetic medication use, glycemic control, and diabetes-related hospitalizations and mortality for an elderly cohort with diabetes before the implementation of Part D. We hypothesize that older African American beneficiaries with diabetes will have lower levels of antidiabetic medication use, worse glycemic control, and higher diabetes-related hospitalization and mortality rates compared to Caucasian beneficiaries. Second, we will examine whether Part D mitigates racial disparities in medication use, glycemic control, and diabetes-related hospitalizations and mortality in the elderly. We hypothesize that older African Americans compared to Caucasians will experience a larger improvement in medication use, glycemic control, and diabetes-related hospitalizations and mortality. Our study will use longitudinal data from an 11-year, Medicare population-based prospective cohort study. We will adjust our estimates of the effect of race and Part D for socioeconomic status, comorbidities, health, functional and cognitive status, access to care, and other factors. Our research has important policy implications. Medicare Part D -- the most substantial expansion of insurance benefits to older adults since the program's inception over 40 years ago -- is projected to cost just under $1 trillion between 2007 and 2017. If Medicare Part D reduces racial disparities in medication access, our study will inform other efforts to expand insurance coverage to vulnerable populations. Our multidisciplinary research team has extensive experience conducting health policy analyses, pharmacoepidemiologic studies with geriatric populations, health disparities and diabetes research, and is uniquely positioned to shed light on this critical policy issue.             ",Impact of Medicare Part D on Racial Disparities in Diabetes Treatment and Outcome,8111682,R01HS017695,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2011,215252,0.04968621843607962
"Organizational Variability and Racial Disparities in Hospice Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  My goal is to become an academic geriatrician focused on reducing disparities in end-of-life care. I have already initiated this career plan through completion of a Master of Health Sciences and research examining cultural attitudes and beliefs which may impact hospice use by older African Americans. With this award, I would acquire additional training in health disparities research. My research and career development plan will be overseen by mentors with research expertise in end-of-life care and content expertise related to the care of African Americans with life-limiting illness. Compared to Caucasians, African Americans are more likely to experience poor quality healthcare at the end of life. Also, studies document lower rates of hospice use among older African Americans. Because hospice is currently the most effective model for care at the end of life, increasing hospice use by older African Americans may reduce racial disparities in end-of-life care. To date, no research has evaluated the association between the organizational characteristics of hospices and disparities in their service to older African Americans and Caucasians. This research will test the hypothesis that racial disparities in hospice use are associated with variability in the structure, programs, and policies of individual hospice agencies. The specific aims are to: (1) Describe hospice-level variability in disparities in service to older African Americans and Caucasians; (2) Describe hospice-level variability in structure, programs, and policies which may influence hospice use by African Americans; (3) Identify organizational characteristics that facilitate the use of hospice by African Americans. This research will include: an analysis of Medicare Claims Data and a comprehensive database of the characteristics of hospices throughout North and South Carolina; and a survey and qualitative interview with hospice providers in the two states. The findings of this work will inform the development of organizational-level interventions to increase hospice use by older African Americans and eliminate racial disparities throughout the life course. Plain public health statement: Despite higher mortality rates from a number of chronic illnesses, African Americans use hospice services at lower rates that Caucasians. This research will determine which hospice programs and practices may increase the use of hospice by African Americans.           ",Organizational Variability and Racial Disparities in Hospice Use,8073001,K08AG028975,"['Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' effective intervention ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Provider ', ' operation ', ' Attitude ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Belief ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Award ', ' evidence base ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Inpatients ', ' demographics ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Budgets ', ' Interview ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Mentors ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Policies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Caring ', ' Perception ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' chemotherapy ', ' Development Plans ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' Address ', ' Medical ', ' experience ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' Church ', ' health science research ', ' North Carolina ', ' Communities ', ' Life ', ' Structure ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Training ', ' Population ', ' Research ', ' Goals ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Data ', ' Area ', ' Testing ', ' social ', ' Chronic ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Modeling ', ' Patients ', ' Affect ', ' programs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Future ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Marketing ', ' success ', ' Series ', ' Hospice Programs ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' response ', ' Characteristics ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Location ', ' Age ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Work ', ' career ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' career development ', ' tube feeding ', ' South Carolina ', ' Transfusion ', ' TRNSF ', ' Ownership ', ' Palliative Care ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' outreach program ', ' community organizations ', ' sensitivity training ', ' Accreditation ', ' Police ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Community Outreach ', ' County ', ' Caucasians ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Hospice Care ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Organizational Policy ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Certification ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' ']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K08,2011,165200,0.08862907385418875
"Rural Health Clinics in Accountable Care Organizations: Impact on Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed longitudinal study investigates the care provided by Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) to older adults in the Southern region of the U.S., as well as the costs of that care. Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) offer potential opportunities to RHCs despite several rural constraints to ACO participation.  However, little is known about how the ACO model accommodates the unique challenges of RHCs, and the impact of RHC participation on the health disparities of rural older adults including those of minority groups.  The specific aims of the study are: 1) to analyze and describe the extent of RHC participation in ACOs, and the characteristics of RHCs that choose to participate in ACOs; 2) to analyze ACO participation and other factors that impact health disparities of rural populations served by RHCs; and 3) to analyze ACO participation and other factors that impact cost efficiency and preventive care effectiveness for RHC older adult patients. The major research hypotheses are: 1) A higher percentage of provider-based RHCs will  participate in ACOs compared to independent RHCs; 2) RHCs in networks will be more likely to participate  in ACOs than unaffiliated RHCs; 3) Large RHCs are more likely to participate in ACOs than small RHCs; 4)  RHC participation in ACOs is positively related to reduction of disparities of older adult rural patients,  controlling for the effects of contextual factors; 5) RHC participation in ACOs is positively related to quality of  care practices, controlling for the effects of contextual factors (such as ethnic/racial distribution and rurality);  6) RHC participation in ACOs is positively related to health outcomes of older adult rural patients, controlling  for the effects o contextual factors (such as ethnic/racial distribution and rurality); and 7) RHC participation  in ACOs will have a positive impact on cost efficiency and preventive care effectiveness. We will triangulate our analyses by using both quantitative and qualitative research methods including analysis of secondary data, survey research, and case studies.

"Linking Personality and SES Influences on Lifespan Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this K08 Mentored Career Development Award application, Ben Chapman, PhD, a psychologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC), proposes to integrate approaches from personality psychology and social epidemiology to study socioeconomically (SES) based health disparities across the latter part of life. Proposed are a comprehensive educational plan, original data collection, and secondary analyses of existing datasets designed to equip the applicant to become a leading investigator of how the social stratification in lifespan health trajectories is influenced by individual personality. He will receive formal training in social epidemiology, health and aging, and multilevel statistics through formal coursework and mentored didactics with a team of nationally recognized experts in these areas. Dr. Chapman's research program proposes two scientific aims, based on a synthesis of theory and findings from social epidemiology and personality and health, under a conceptual framework of life course epidemiology. The Aims examine the interaction between personality and SES factors influencing health behaviors and general illness burden across the second half of life. New data collection focuses on how personality influences health under conditions of socioeconomic deprivation, involving 18-24 month follow up of a pilot cohort (N=106) of ethnically diverse, lower SES middle age and older adults currently being accrued. This will provide Dr. Chapman with valuable experience following a small cohort over a short time, in preparation for larger studies, and obtain health data rare in existing data sources, like inflammatory biomarkers. Existing data sources are selected for longitudinal information on personality, SES, and health, permitting well-powered hypothesis tests over the Midlife Development in the US, Hawaii Culture and Health, and Older Adults in Primary Care studies. From a public health view, lifespan health is powerfully tied to social inequalities; but not all disadvantaged people suffer worse, and not all advantaged people enjoy better health as they age. Attention to individual psychological and behavioral dispositions can aid understanding of this heterogeneity. Blending personality and social epidemiology will better illuminate the interface between person and social structure in healthy aging.           ",Linking Personality and SES Influences on Lifespan Health,8122118,K08AG031328,"['bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Preparation ', ' Life ', ' Medical center ', ' Affect ', ' Measurement ', ' Health ', ' Sample Size ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Sampling ', ' Structure ', ' Adopted ', ' Data Collection ', ' Shapes ', ' Time ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Outcome ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Grant ', ' Psychologist ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Data Sources ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Resolution ', ' Funding ', ' base ', ' Individual ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 (B cell stimulating factor 2) ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Risk ', ' cohort ', ' Future ', ' Complex ', ' Inflammatory ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Health behavior ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' social ', ' Biological ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' programs ', ' theories ', ' Data ', ' Testing ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Persons ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' healthy aging ', ' Research ', ' Award ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' statistics ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Personality Traits ', ' Process ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavioral ', ' skills ', ' Minority ', ' Reporting ', ' experience ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Genes ', ' Recommendation ', ' Mentors ', ' Universities ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Link ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Pattern ', ' Attention ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Hawaii ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Social Psychology ', ' heuristics ', ' social inequality ', ' Stratification ', ' Fellowship ', ' Personality ', ' Half-Life ', ' deprivation ', ' Psychology ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K08,2011,124836,0.022008744314536526
"Early and Mid-Life Social Determinants of Racial Disparities in Late-Life Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed study is to examine childhood and mid-life adulthood social determinants of health disparities between older blacks and whites. The study will assess racial disparities in late-life health in four biological outcomes: blood pressure, glycemic control, sub-clinical cerebrovascular disease, and inflammation. These outcomes were selected because of their relevance for racial disparities in health and the prevention of late-life disability and cognitive impairment. The study will focus on personal social resources (e.g., education, occupational status), and residential environment social conditions (e.g., birth county level of socio-economic status, neighborhood segregation during adulthood), and examine the degree to which these social resources and conditions experienced prior to older age account for racial disparities in late-life health. The study will also test whether racial disparities in late-life health ablood specimens in this population which are needed to obtain a measure of glycemic control. Despite general improvements in overall health among older adults in the US, racial disparities in late-life health continue to be large and pervasive. Racial differences in social resources and conditions in earlier stages of life are likely to be an important factor in alleviating these disparities. Findings from this study will provide a better understanding of the social and biological mechanisms that contribute to racial disparities in late-life health, creating a foundation for policies and strategies to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities between older blacks and whites.

An important strength of the study is that it will take advantage of the availability of detailed information on most social and biological factors of interest. This information is derived from an ongoing cohort study in a large population of older blacks and whites.

"Psychological Well Being and Recovery Among Older Hospitalized Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposed study addresses the Program Announcement entitled ""Research on Mind-Body Interactions and Health"" (PA-07-046). Specifically, we address the National Institute on Aging (NIA) interest in exploring associations between psychological well-being and functional ability in older adults hospitalized for acute illness. The Specific Aims of the proposed application are to: 1. Examine change in functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. Functional status will be assessed by a battery of measures (a 4 meter walk, a test of grip strength, knee extensor strength and seven activities of daily living (ADLs)) at 5 time points: within 24 hours of hospital admission and discharge, and 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge. 2. Examine direct and indirect associations between psychological well-being and functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. Psychological well-being, assessed by a 6- domain psychological well-being instrument and a positive affect summary scale, will be used to examine patterns of association with functional status over the 5 time points outlined in aim 1. 3. Examine whether psychological well-being modifies ethnic health disparities associated with functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. This aim will allow us to examine how ethnic group (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics) interacts with psychological well-being to influence functional status over the 5 time points outlined in aim 1. To explore our aims, we plan to follow up an ethnically diverse sample of 800 older patients (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics) admitted to the Acute Care for Elders (ACE) unit at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Older adults enrolled in the study will be assessed at five time points: within 24 hours of hospital admission, within 24 hours of hospital discharge and 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge. The five time points will allow us not only to examine overall patterns of effect between functional status and psychological well-being but it will also allow us to examine patterns of effect over distinct time periods including hospitalization and post discharge. The three post discharge follow up interviews will further allow us to examine and explain associations between functional status and psychological well-being in relation to short (1 month) and longer term (6 and 12 month) recovery patterns. A central goal of the current application is to examine whether psychological well-being can influence the risk for functional status decline associated with hospitalization in an ethnically diverse older patient population.          ",Psychological Well Being and Recovery Among Older Hospitalized Adults,8077928,R01AG031178,"['Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Hospitalization ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Recovery ', ' Interview ', ' instrument ', ' Caring ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' patient population ', ' interest ', ' Pattern ', ' Well in self ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Mental well-being ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Life ', ' Universities ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Affect ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Hospitals ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Communities ', ' Investigation ', ' Time ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Data ', ' Hour ', ' Medical ', ' Sampling ', ' Outcome ', ' Health ', ' Goals ', ' Address ', ' Patients ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Acute ', ' functional status ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Knee ', ' meter ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Texas ', ' Walking ', ' body-mind ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' Mind-Body Relationship (Physiology) ', ' mind body interaction ', ' brain-body interaction ', ' Relations, Mind-Body (Physiology) ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R01,2011,265108,0.05681933364459836
"Health Care Partners in Cancer Prevention and Care Among Aged - Competing Renewal    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We plan to implement a novel, community based educational program to inform and motivate underserved older adults to forge partnerships with their doctors, targeting cancer prevention as a shared goal. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will evaluate the efficacy of our social learning theory based intervention that promotes patient participation in order to enhance patient centered medical care. This study builds on findings of our ongoing study of Health Care Partnerships in Cancer Prevention and Care. Specifically we propose a multi-modal health communication training program for older adults. This educational intervention (""Speak Up"" program), aims to improve patient initiative, competence, and confidence in communication with physicians. Based on foundations of social learning theory the intervention is expected to result in increased discussion between older adults and their primary care physicians about cancer prevention and screening. Participants in the intervention are also expected to receive more age and risk specific preventive advice from their doctors and report greater satisfaction with their health care. Participants in the ""Speak Up"" facilitated discussion groups (N=480) will be compared to participants in ""Connect"" attention control groups (N=480). The latter program addresses important goals of enhancing civic and social engagement. The intervention program will be conducted in small groups and offer user-friendly experiential learning including information, discussion, and role play in order to help older persons develop better communication skills. The study will be conducted among randomly selected community dwelling elders who had participated in our prior research, and among community based older adults who attend Senior Center nutrition programs, sponsored by Area Agencies on Aging (AAA). Based on comparing pre-intervention assessments with 2 week, 6 month, and 12 month telephone follow-up evaluations, we will determine both the short term and long term impact of the intervention. We will consider participants' personal characteristics and their physicians' background and supportiveness as they may influence uptake of the intervention. We designed the study based on intervention research (CONSORT) guidelines for conducting RCTs, and will carefully evaluate treatment fidelity. In addition to patient reported outcomes, we will also consider objective indices based on Medicare claims data and AAA data on program utilization. We will use multilevel models with fixed and random effects in our quantitative data analyses. Using a mixed methods design, we will also include a qualitative study component based on in-depth interviews with 60 participants selected based on high versus low program benefits. Our study is closely aligned with the mission of the National Cancer Institute to improve cancer control and to reduce health disparities in cancer prevention and care. We plan an active dissemination effort to insure that this portable and cost effective intervention may be widely adopted by community organizations such as Area Agencies on Aging that serve diverse older adults.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study has direct relevance to public health. Our goal is to improve older patients' advocacy skills and their ability to communicate with their physicians regarding cancer prevention and general medical care. We expect that the confidence and initiative they will acquire as a result of our intervention will result in improvements in the preventive care they will receive. Having well informed patients, who also respect physician expertise, participating in medical encounters, will improve both efficiency and effectiveness of office visits for the aged. Prevention and early detection of cancer have been recognized as important public health strategies for reducing the burden of chronic and life threatening illnesses, both on society and on individuals. Our focus on communication skills training among low health literacy and minority elders should also contribute to minimizing health disparities.           The proposed study has direct relevance to public health.

"Mechanisms of health disparities in parkinsonism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for an NIA Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development (K23) award seeks support to develop a program of research related to understanding the mechanisms of health disparities in Parkinsonism. As part of the education plan, the PI proposes to: 1) Increase her understanding of health behavior theory, geriatrics and health disparities; 2) Gain additional epidemiological skills in study design and health measurement; and 3) Acquire the analytic skills associated with psychometric and longitudinal data analysis. Along with these educational goals, there is an associated research project.  The principal research objective of this project is to understand the patient-level factors related to healthcare disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinsonian signs. Specifically, this study proposes to evaluate how older adults' aging beliefs affect the recognition of Parkinsonian signs, and how race, culture and socioeconomic status impact this relationship. To achieve these goals, there are three specific aims: 1) To validate a screening instrument for Parkinsonian signs by comparing it with neurological examination; 2) To examine older adults' beliefs regarding movement changes and their association with Parkinsonian signs and relevant patient-level characteristics; and 3) To determine the association between beliefs about aging, subsequent comorbidities, including falls and fractures, and the detection and treatment of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. After validation of a screening instrument for Parkinsonian signs, this measure will be incorporated into a cross-sectional and prospective evaluation of the relationship between aging beliefs and Parkinsonian signs, particularly as it is modified by socioeconomic factors. Subjects will be recruited and surveyed in primary care clinics and outcomes will be determined through the electronic health record. Successful completion of this project will lead to the development of educational interventions targeting improved understanding of aging related functional decline among older adults. This application will provide critical support for the PI to become an independent researcher and a leader in health services research in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aging-related movement problems are common in older adults and lead to increased disability and death.

"Racial Disparities in Heart Attack Recovery: Role of Stress and Stigma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), older African Americans tend to have significantly worse functional recovery and higher mortality rates than same-aged Whites. Race differences in older individuals' cardiovascular outcomes remain after adjusting for factors that traditionally have been used to explain this disparity, such as socioeconomic status and access to health care. Our overall goal is to examine whether this racial disparity in older individuals' AMI-recovery outcomes is partially explained by the combined influence of age stigma and race stigma, both of which can generate stress.       Based on our pilot data, the stigma literature, and Rutter's theory of cumulative risk, we will examine the following hypotheses for the first time: (1) African Americans and Whites with greater age stigma will have worse functional recovery; (2) Age stigma's deleterious influence on functional recovery will be greater among African Americans than Whites; (3) Among African Americans, (a) those with greater age stigma and race stigma will have worse functional recovery, and (b) age stigma and race stigma will act in a synergistic way to worsen functional recovery; and (4) Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction will mediate the process by which (a) age stigma impacts the functional recovery of African Americans and Whites, and (b) race stigma impacts the functional recovery of African Americans.       The secondary aim of the proposed study is to identify methods to help older persons recovering from an AMI cope with age stigma and race stigma. We will focus on coping strategies that may be amenable to future interventions.       Using a prospective, longitudinal design, our interdisciplinary team will assess 200 African Americans and 200 Whites, aged 50 and over, within a week of hospital admission following an AMI, and assess them again one month, four months, eight months, and twelve months later. Functional recovery will be assessed by physical performance over time. The mediator, ANS dysfunction, will be measured by 24-hour heart-rate variability and acute response to laboratory stressors. Secondary outcomes consist of depression, cognitive functioning, and adverse cardiovascular events. Relevant covariates will be included in analyses, such as age, AMI severity, and depression.       This study is responsive to PA-05-029,  Societal and Cultural Dimensions of Health,  because we will examine how the societal construct of stigma influences AMI recovery. Additionally, the study fits the NHLBI Strategy for Addressing Health Disparities which includes identifying psychosocial mechanisms that contribute to the progression of diseases that disproportionately affect minorities. The proposed research could illuminate an unexplored mechanism that enable stigmas to worsen health. In addition, it could lay the groundwork for future interventions to improve the AMI-recovery experience of older persons in general and African American older persons in particular.      Public Health Relevance: The worse recovery of older African Americans following a heart attack has been a persistent public-health problem. We expect to show how a previously unexplored psychological factor, in combination with a physical factor, contributes to the disparity between African American and White recovery. Further, our research could lay the groundwork for future cost-effective procedures to improve heart attack recovery of older persons in general and African American older persons in particular.          ",Racial Disparities in Heart Attack Recovery: Role of Stress and Stigma,8102893,R01HL089314,"['Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Stigmata ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Walking ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' cognitive function ', ' age group ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Belief ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Exposure to ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Stress ', ' Chronic ', ' social ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Procedures ', ' Translating ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Clinical ', ' Time ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Severities ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' Recovery ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Categories ', ' theories ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Health ', ' improved ', ' experience ', ' Hour ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Mediating ', ' Hospitals ', ' Methods ', ' Minority ', ' Individual ', ' prospective ', ' aged ', ' public health relevance ', ' Dimensions ', ' psychosocial ', ' stressor ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' response ', ' Future ', ' Label ', ' Heart ', ' Acute ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Process ', ' base ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Research ', ' Modeling ', ' Age ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Outcome ', ' Laboratories ', ' coping ', ' Reporting ', ' Data ', ' Persons ', ' Address ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Goals ', ' Risk ', ' Affect ', ' Sampling ', ' Performance ', ' Literature ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Event ', ' Laboratory Finding ', ' Lab Findings ', ' racism ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Glossary ', ' Ageism ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' heart rate variability ', ' Stereotyping ', ' ']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,598880,0.04286844078494607

"Inpatient Rehabilitation Outcomes in Medicare Hip Fracture Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To date, policy directives based on anecdotal reports, drive utilization and treatment decisions. Although hip fracture is considered by Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as a medically appropriate diagnosis for Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) care, little evidence is available to support this assumption. Building on sparse existing evidence, the overall objective of this project is to determine which client and system characteristics result in improved rehabilitation outcomes. An analytic file using two large national datasets, the CMS Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility - Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI) and the Provider of Service (POS) file, will be constructed to test regression models of factors that may explain differences in rehabilitation outcomes between two time points, admission and discharge from IRFs. Using the Andersen's Model for Health Services Use as the conceptual framework, the proposed longitudinal study aims to: (1) determine the influence of individual characteristics (Predisposing: age, gender, race), (Enabling: social support), (Need: functional status and cognitive status on admission, and comorbidities) on rehabilitation outcomes (motor functioning, functional status and discharged home) for Medicare beneficiaries with hip fracture in IRFs; and (2) determine the influence of contextual characteristics (type, size, location, ownership and nurse staffing) on IRF aggregate rehabilitation outcomes (motor functioning, functional status, and discharge home), controlling for the influence of aggregate individual characteristics (Predisposing, Enabling and Need) of Medicare beneficiaries with hip fracture in IRFs. This study will inform the policy debate on which types of patients are most appropriate for IRFs and will determine the effectiveness of IRFs in delivering rehabilitative treatment based on specific individual and contextual characteristics associated with rehabilitative outcomes among hip fracture patients and vulnerable subgroups (i.e., racial/ethnic minorities, older adults without adequate social support and those 85 years and older). Of particular concern is determining the evidence base to indicate that such effectiveness will result in positive outcomes among racial/ethnic minorities. Given the growing national interest in health disparities, it becomes increasingly important to determine if there are differences in outcomes based on race/ethnicity. Health disparities remain a major research focus of the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR). The proposed research and subsequent analysis will add to the current body of nursing knowledge by identifying characteristics that better inform interventions that look to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that more than 350,000 hip fractures occur annually in the US with a lifetime attributable cost of $81,300 from a hip fracture, including care provided during acute hospitalization and across the post-acute continuum (inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing and home health). For many older adults, the personal costs of a fractured hip results in chronic disability and complications, loss of independent ambulation, functional dependence and death. With the growing numbers of older adults and the complexity of their health conditions, appropriate and effective geriatric rehabilitation services are needed. The nation's baby boomers will be turning age 65 in 2011 and will bring about major demographic changes which will certainly influence the delivery of health care. Consequently, in order to effectively care for an aging population with increasing rates of injury and chronic diseases, nurses and other health care providers require the evidence base indicating ""what"" is effective and ""why.""

"Enhancing Motivation for Physical Activity to Reduce the Risk of Falls Unintentional falls among community-dwelling older adults are a common, serious and potentially preventable public health problem. In the United States, the annual incidence of fall related injuries per 100,000 persons was 4616 in 2001, rising to 5252 in 2008. The annual incidence of fall related deaths per 100,000 persons was 29.3 in 2000, rising to 41.86 in 2006. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to falls as they age. The consequences of falls are significant to both individuals and communities exerting a negative impact on the health of older adult populations. Potential consequences include fractures, fear of falling, emergency room, hospital and nursing home admissions, dependence, confusion, immobilization, depression, and death. Significant modifiable fall risk factors include muscle weakness, gait problems, and balance problems. While researchers have demonstrated the positive effects of fall preventive physical activity, the majority of older adults remain sedentary and the rate of falls continues to increase. Older adults participate in regular physical activity and fitness activities less often than younger populations; disparities are greater among older adults who are poor and living in rural communities. While knowledge about causes, risk factors, and efficacious physical activity to prevent falls has grown exponentially in the last several decades, bridging the gap between research and practice continues to be a challenge. As a strategy to address the gap between research and practice, the proposed study will utilize a tested theory, the wellness motivation theory, to address behavioral change in combination with instruction for physical activity. The target population of the proposed pilot intervention study includes rural community dwelling older adults, an understudied population in this field. Innovative measures of fall risk (balance) and physical activity patterning will include an accelerometer with remote sensitivity. Primary aims of the proposed pilot study include (a) examining acceptability and feasibility of the wellness motivation intervention, and (b) pilot testing the efficacy of the wellness motivation intervention to increase contextual resources, behavioral change process variables, the behavioral outcome of physical activity, and health outcome of fall risk reduction (increased balance and strength). The proposed study is the first step in a program of research focusing on the prevention of falls and frailty among older adults. Project Narrative  Unintentional falls among community-dwelling older adults are a common, serious, and potentially preventable public health problem. Researchers have demonstrated the positive effects of physical activity to prevent falls, yet the majority of older adults do not engage in everyday physical activity behaviors. The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to examine the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of an intervention that utilizes a behavioral change theory (the wellness motivation theory) to promote the adoption and maintenance of physical activities that reduce falls among rural community-dwelling older adults.",Enhancing Motivation for Physical Activity to Reduce the Risk of Falls,8118857,F31NR012351,"['National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' sedentary ', ' Rural ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Financial cost ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Annual Reports ', ' Death Rate ', ' Physical Fitness ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Target Populations ', ' Minnesota ', ' Confusion ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Motivation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Gait ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' cost ', ' aged ', ' falls ', ' Incidence ', ' theories ', ' Preventive ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Attention ', ' Dependence ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Population ', ' Life ', ' Immobilization ', ' orthopedic freezing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Address ', ' Control Groups ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Pattern ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evaluation ', ' Hospitals ', ' Biological ', ' Measurement ', ' Process ', ' Health ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' stem ', ' Age ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Research ', ' programs ', ' Measures ', ' Risk ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Outcome ', ' Goals ', ' United States ', ' Knowledge ', ' Medical ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Behavioral ', ' base ', ' Physical activity ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Adoption ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Behavior ', ' Persons ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Individual ', ' social ', ' Instruction ', ' Maintenance ', ' Injury ', ' Communities ', ' efficacy testing ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Participant ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' frailty ', ' Arizona ', ' motivational intervention ', ' Self Perception ', ' self knowledge ', ' self awareness ', ' Self view ', ' Self image ', ' Personal awareness ', ' fall risk ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Rural Community ', ' Muscle Weakness ', ' Muscular Weakness ', ' Fall prevention ', ' preventing falls ', ' fear of falling ', ' ']",NINR,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2011,35110,0.1612432721717076
"Increasing Access to Hospice Care for Older African Americans:  A National Study     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Disparities in healthcare access and quality are well-documented for African Americans and include not only disease prevention, early detection, and appropriate treatment but also end-of-life care. Compared to Whites, African Americans are more likely to experience poor quality care at the end of life, including inadequate pain management and poor provider communication, and to report lower overall satisfaction with the quality of end-of-life care. Also, older African Americans with advanced illness are less likely than Whites to enroll in hospice which is currently the most comprehensive model for the care of patients at the end-of-life. Hospice enrollment is associated with both improvements in multiple domains of care, including symptom management and provider communication, and reduced disparities between Whites and African Americans in the quality of end-of-life care. Therefore, increasing the use of hospice care by older African Americans may result in a greater likelihood of high quality, patient-centered end-of-life care for this vulnerable population.  Like other healh disparities research, much of the literature on racial disparities in hospice use has focused on documenting the problem rather than seeking solutions. There is little empiric research identifying modifiable factors which may influence the use of hospice of care. Preliminary work suggests that hospice providers may be one target for interventions to increase access to hospice for older African Americans. This idea is supported by significant variability in the practices and policies of individual hospice providers beyond requirements for Medicare certification and the large variability across hospice service areas in the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries who enroll in hospice. This variability is even greater among African Americans and is not explained by decedent demographics or healthcare market factors. Additionally, although health care organizational culture is increasing being recognized as an important determinant of health disparities, much of the literature on organizational factors associated with the use of hospice by African Americans includes expert opinion of strategies that should work (i.e. community-based partnerships), but there have been no well- controlled analyses attempting to determine which of these strategies work best under which circumstances.  The overall goal of this project is to identify modifiable practices of hospice providers that are associated with greater use of hospice care by older African Americans in their service area. Using a survey and qualitative interview of a national sample of hospice providers, the study's specific aims will examine the association between the admission policies, community outreach practices, and other organizational characteristics, such as staff diversity, goals and strategic planning of hospice providers and service to older African Americans in their service area. Understanding which organizational practices are associated with greater use of hospice by African Americans will inform the development of interventions to increase access to hospice care and improve the quality of end-of-life care.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Despite higher mortality rates from a number of chronic illnesses and lower quality end-of-life care, African Americans use hospice services at lower rates that Whites. Hospice use is associated with improvements in the quality of end-of-life care. This research will identify the practices of hospice providers (i.e. community partnerships) which are associated with greater use of hospice care by older African Americans in their service area.               Despite higher mortality rates from a number of chronic illnesses and lower quality end-of-life care, African Americans use hospice services at lower rates that Whites.

"Chinese Health and Aging Project: Building Support through Community Engagement This application aims to set the foundation for a longitudinal population-based study of relevant health issues in older Chinese persons by leveraging a comprehensive model of community engagement. The diverse US population is rapidly aging; as such, it is imperative from a public health perspective that we have accurate understanding of relevant health issues among specific racial/ethnic populations. There are an estimated 3.8 million Chinese in the US, and Chicago has one of the largest aggregations. Despite the rapid growth, we have the most rudimentary understanding of many critical health issues facing the older Chinese population (cognitive impairment, physical disability, racial discrimination, psychological distress, social isolation, filial piety, cultural values, and elder mistreatment [elder abuse, neglect and exploitation perpetrated by others as well as elder self-neglect]. Furthermore, there has been inadequate community network and support necessary to empower the Chinese community to be fully engaged in health sciences research. These impediments necessitate the further development and implementation of sustainable and equal partnership of both community and researchers through reciprocal transfer of expertise to improve the health of the Chinese population.    Several challenges to conducting a community-engaged population study in a Chicago Chinese population make the proposed developmental work an important first step to conducting a longitudinal population-based cohort study. These challenges are: 1) US Chinese older persons have been reluctant to participate in government sponsored research and sustainable community support has been inadequate; 2) there is incomplete enumeration at the local level of Chinese older persons in the community; and 3) there are marked linguistic and cultural barriers that make a population-based study challenging. In this proposed work, a bilingual and bicultural principal investigator and an experienced interdisciplinary investigative team at the Rush Institute for Healthy Aging are collaborating with Chinese community to overcome these barriers. The specific aims of this feasibility study are to: 1) Further engage the community to build a culturally appropriate and sustainable collaborative partnership in support of the study; 2) Pilot a random block census of older Chinatown residents; and 3) Examine the linguistic and cultural barriers of studying relevant health disparity issues. The findings from this proposal and community engagement activities can be critical to the successful conduct of a community-engaged longitudinal population-based study of relevant health issues in Chinese older persons. This application aims to build comprehensive community network and support in Chicago Chinatown community, to conduct a pilot census of the Chinatown community, and to examine the linguistic and cultural issues facing older Chinese population.

"Reducing disability via a bundled bio-behavioral-environmental approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disability in older adults is a major public health problem, particularly among low-income urban people of color. Most disabled older adults strongly prefer to live at home, but many require nursing home admission due to limitation in basic or instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs or IADLs). Since these costly admissions are preventable, testing novel, cost-effective interventions to improve ADLs should be a public health priority. Previous research has not comprehensively addressed individuals and the environment in which they function yet low income older adults suffer from health disparities in both their function and their home environments. We propose a two-group randomized trial to test the efficacy of our bio-behavioral-environmental intervention, Community Aging in Place - Advancing Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE), which combines evidence-based nursing, occupational therapy, and handyman components. In a randomized controlled pilot trial, the CAPABLE intervention had preliminary effect sizes of 0.63 and 0.62 for reducing difficulty in ADLs and IADLs respectively, when comparing the mean changes in the intervention group to the control group from baseline to follow up. These pilot findings warrant an efficacy trial. We will recruit low-income older (eage 65), principally African-American, adults with e 1 ADL or e 2 IADL limitations from the Baltimore Department of Housing Energy Assistance Program. We will interview them at home and randomize participants to either the treatment (CAPABLE intervention) or control (attention-control) group. Participants in the treatment group will receiv up to 10 in-home sessions -- d6 visits with an occupational therapist and d4 visits from a nurse - and d$1200 in safety and modification services from a licensed handyman. Each treatment participant will receive each intervention component but interventionists will systematically tailo content to the participants' risk profile and goals based on protocols. Participants in the control group will receive an equivalent number of visits, which will consist of sedentary activities with  trained research assistant (RA). All participants will be reassessed at 16 and 52 weeks in person by an RA masked to treatment condition. The primary endpoint is the ability to complete ADLs and IADLs without difficulty at 16 weeks post-randomization. Other endpoints include lower extremity mobility, health-related quality of life, and home safety at 16 weeks and ADL and IADL limitations at 52 weeks post-randomization. We will examine moderators of treatment success and mediating mechanisms. We will also evaluate cost-effectiveness based on the cost of the intervention and health care utilization. The study is designed to detect clinically meaningful improvement in ADL or IADL limitations between the intervention and control group with 80 percent power (alpha = 0.05) in an intention to treat analysis. The innovative study will provide economic evidence for a theory-driven intervention that could rein in costs of a growing and increasingly diverse older adult population.          Disability in older adults is a major public health problem, particularly among low-income, urban people of color. Most adults with disabilities strongly prefer to live at home, but many have difficulty taking care of themselves. This study proposes to test the efficacy of a newly developed bio- behavioral-environmental intervention, Community Aging in Place - Advancing Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE), which combines evidence-based nursing, occupational therapy, and handyman components to help low income older adults function at home and save our nation costly nursing home care.

"Ideal Affect and Health Decision Making Across the Lifespan    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the number of minorities and older adults in the U.S. increase, it is increasingly important to reduce health care disparities among these groups. Recent reports have shown that ethnic disparities in health care utilization, such as successful patient-physician communication and engagement in preventative behaviors, are especially critical for older adults. Optimal health care depends on whether an individual chooses to follow their doctors' recommendations, adhere to prescribed treatments, and engage in health promotion programs. Understanding cultural and age-related differences in how these choices are made can help to reduce disparities in health care. The proposed program of research will test applications of Affect Valuation Theory (AVT) as a theoretical foundation for understanding cultural and age-related differences in how health care decisions are made. AVT suggests that variation in ""ideal affect"" (i.e., the affective states that people value) may contribute to cultural and age-related differences in health care decisions. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) Examine the relationship between ideal affect and health care decisions; and (2) Determine whether cultural and age-related differences in ideal affect may in part account for differences in health care decisions. Using both survey and experimental methods, we will investigate the relationship between ideal affect and health decision making across the life span for two distinct cultural groups, European American and Chinese American. First, we will measure how ideal affect influences health care decision making among participants ranging in age from 21 to 80. Then, we will manipulate ideal affect and subsequently assess preferences for health care options. Findings from these studies will establish the role of ideal affect and health care decision making as a potential mechanism for explaining ethnic health disparities across the life span.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By understanding how ideal affect influences decision making across age and cultural groups, the proposed research will help to develop more culturally sensitive and appropriate treatments and interventions. Thus, integrating ideal affect into the improvement of health care programs may address the needs of diverse populations more adequately.

"Health IT decision support to improve medication management safety and quality     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For older adults, polypharmacy is a major safety issue with serious economic implications. Dr. Gerardo Moreno proposes research needed to investigate the use of health information technology (HIT) to improve medication management decision making for older adults in community health centers. The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award will provide Dr. Moreno, a family medicine physician from UCLA, the resources to focus his research on aging and to obtain additional research training needed to become an independent principal investigator. The detailed research and career development experiences proposed aim to build upon his existing research skill set to gain needed expertise to: 1) develop his independence as a productive principal investigator in the area of Latino aging health disparities; 2) further focus his research and gain significant expertise in aging-related issues; and 3) expand his qualitative research skills and implementation science skills. To achieve these goals, Dr. Moreno will complete course work, directed reading tutorials, and practical research experience. The career development activities also include mentorship and resources from the UCLA Resource Center for Minority Aging Research, a program devoted to eliminating disparities in health and health care among minority elders and to developing minority faculty who will be independently funded investigators who conduct aging research. Dr. Moreno's multidisciplinary mentorship team includes a health services researcher, social scientist, health informatics researcher, statistician with formal computer science training, and geriatrician. This proposal will use principles of community-based participatory research to build upon an established 4 year academic-community research partnership developed by the applicant with a large rural community health center.            For older adults with multiple chronic conditions, polypharmacy can lead to increased use of potentially inappropriate medications and at the same time to the underutilization of medications known to improve health outcomes. Health (IT) tools may improve decision making for medication management but we know little about their application in community health centers and other safety-net settings. An overall objective of this proposal is to enhance Dr. Moreno's research skills and to conduct preliminary studies needed to develop health IT point-of-care (POC) decision support tailored to the prescription drug management needs of older adults in a safety-net system. Health IT POC clinical decision support in community health centers can be adopted by clinicians and hold great promise for improving the safety and quality of medication management for older adults when the end users of the system are incorporated into the research process from start to finish. Therefore, Dr. Moreno proposes research in partnership with a large rural community/migrant health center in California's impoverished San Joaquin Valley that serves two counties and has 22 clinical sites. His community partner's patient population is 72 percent Latino which is significant given the current and projected increase of elderly Latinos over the next few decades. To this end, the specific aims that focus on adults ¿ 60 years of age are: 1) to examine the prevalence and correlates of use of potentially inappropriate medications, 2) to examine how often there is suboptimal medication intensification of needed treatments for those with hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemias, 3) to identify provider, patient, and stakeholder barriers and facilitators (e.g. work flow issues and tailoring of message) to adoption of patient-centered health IT POC decision support designed to improve prescription drug management and safety, and 4) to adapt and develop a prototype of health IT POC decision support system for prescription drug management tailored to older adults with cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemias. Aims 1-3 will inform the development and the decision support content and targeted messaging that is proposed in Aim 4. This research forms the basis for an R01 application of an adequately powered randomized clinical trial of health IT POC decision support to improve medication management quality and safety for older adults across a regional community clinic network.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older adults are at increased risk of using potentially inappropriate medications and paradoxically of under using treatments known to improve control of cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure. Health information technology (HIT) decision support to improve medication management delivered electronically during the patient visit holds great potential for decreasing use of potentially inappropriate medications and increasing the use of beneficial treatments. This project is grounded in an established community-based approach that will systematically include feedback from physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and patients so that the medication decision support tools developed are widely accepted and address the most important barriers for safe prescribing for older adults with chronic conditions.                  Older adults are at increased risk of using potentially inappropriate medications and paradoxically of under using treatments known to improve control of cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure.

"Community Choirs to Promote Healthy Aging and Independence of Older Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The United States is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults. In 2009, there were 39.6 million individuals over age 65, and this number is expected to almost double by 2030. During the same time period, there will be an increase in the number of older adults with diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds who are at increased risk for poor health outcomes relative to non-minority elders. Thus, there is an immediate need to identify cost-effective, widely applicable, and sustainable programs that promote health and well-being of older adults. A growing body of literature suggests that participation in community choral singing may also have positive health benefits for older adults, but there is a need to evaluate the efficacy of a choral program for diverse older adults, and a well-designed randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to help strengthen the evidence base. Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to test the efficacy of community choir program for maintaining health and well-being in culturally diverse older adults. To address the aims of the study, we will evaluate a comprehensive set of outcomes that are hypothesized to be related to choral singing and complete a cost analysis. We will recruit 450 diverse older adults and will utilize 12 existing Administration on Aging-supported senior centers to implement a multi-site, randomized (by center) clinical trial (RCT). Centers will be randomized to receive the choir program immediately (intervention group) or after a 6-month delayed intervention phase (control group). The community choirs will be led by professional music directors. We will assess both primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 months (and 18 months for the delayed intervention group). We will also evaluate the start- up and ongoing program costs for senior centers, including cost/person served and determine quality adjusted life years. If successful, results from this RCT may help develop and further the premise that creative arts can be applied to helping solve national health priorities, such as keeping older adults active, independent, and involved in their communities in readily accessible, affordable, and sustainable ways.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The United States is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, a group that is at increased risk of poor health relative to non-minorities.

"Epidemiology of Suicidal Behavior in Racially/Ethnically Diverse Older Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to RFA-MD-12-001: NIMHD Health Disparities Research. One of the priority areas of this RFA is the study of health conditions associated with significant mortality that have been understudied in health disparity populations. In older Americans, suicide rates are 30% higher than in the general population, and five times higher in non-Hispanic white men age 85 years or older-as the nation continues to grow and racially/ethnically diversify with age so will the rates of suicide. Yet, little is knon about suicide-related behaviors (i.e., ideation, plans, and attempts) in older adults, which are strong risk factors for actual suicide and strong indicators of extreme emotional and mental distress. Even more so, differences in suicidal behavior by race/ethnicity have hardly been investigated at all, as most studies are from non-diverse clinic samples. Moreover, most of what we know about mental health services use related to suicide risk in older Americans comes from small non-diverse samples of suicide completers. However, understanding mental health services use and racial disparities in use is important, as all aging adults with emotional and mental distress related to suicidal thoughts and behaviors may benefit from service use and treatment. The proposed project will investigate the prevalence and predictors of suicidal ideation and related behaviors over the lifetime of older racially and ethnically diverse adults, that is, capturing transitions from ideation to plans and attempts and examining risk of late life and current suicidal behavior. It will also investigate mental health services use in those at increased risk of suicide. The aims will be addressed by studying three nationally representative aggregated data sets: 1) the National Co-morbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), a probability sample of the general U.S.; 2) the National Survey of American Life (NSAL), a probability sample of African- American, Afro-Caribbean, and non-Hispanic White Americans; and 3) the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), a probability sample of Latinos and Asian Americans. The project proposes to make innovative use of the combined data and examine a large, nationally-based cohort of over 3,600 respondents aged 55 and older. In a very cost-efficient approach, this project will be the first comprehensive examination of the prevalence and predictors of suicide-related behaviors and mental health services use in older Americans. Key predictors, including sociodemographic variables, psychiatric disorders, and chronic medical conditions associated with suicidal behavior will be determined (Aims 1 and 2)-assessing differences of associations overall and by race/ethnicity, that is, in older non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. In addition, racial disparities will be assessed separately for men and women (Aim 3), and key predictors of mental health services use will be examined overall and by race/ethnicity (Aim 4). Information stemming from this project will be important for identifying those older adults most at risk of suicide and with great need of care-helping to define national priorities for suicide prevention in late life for all Americans.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Suicidal risk profoundly impacts individuals, families, and society. Knowledge gained from this proposal will be both novel and critical for understanding the occurrence and predictors of suicide-related behaviors (i.e., ideation, planning, and attempts) in older Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White Americans, including use of mental health services in those at increased risk of suicide. Thus, this proposed project will have unique public health importance, because it will provide evidence for future psychiatric research and policy planning that will help to define national priorities for suicide prevention in late life for all Americans.              Suicidal risk profoundly impacts individuals, families, and society.

"Filial Piety and Psychosocial Well-being in Chinese Population     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the rapid growth of Chinese populations, we have the most rudimentary understanding of many health disparities issues facing the US Chinese older adults. Prior local level needs assessment in Chinese communities indicate there are marked gaps in our scientific knowledge on the issues of intergenerational relationships, cultural expectations of aging, depression, suicide, social isolation, and elder mistreatment (elder abuse, neglect, financial exploitation and self-neglect). These marked health disparities are further exacerbated by the linguistic and cultural complexities when dealing with these issues as well as the inadequate community support necessary to empower the Chinese community to be fully engaged as equal partners in research. These impediments necessitate a deeper understanding broader contextual factors associated with these conditions, through the development of sustainable community-academic partnership and the reciprocal transfer of expertise to improve the health of the Chinese population.  Accordingly, we will leverage a comprehensive model of community-based participatory research (CBPR) to examine the cross sectional associations between intergenerational relationships and health and wellbeing of Chinese older adults. More specifically, we aim to examine the cross sectional association between quality and expectations of the filial relationships with the perception of stress and social isolation; to examine the intergenerational discordance, conflict, and mistreatment with respect to their health and wellbeing; and to examine the associations among intergenerational solidarity, frailty and stress and social isolation. Improved understanding of these associations could improve our understanding of key contextual factors that may contribute to future prevention and intervention strategies to improve health and wellbeing of Chinese older adults. To achieve these objectives, a bilingual and bicultural principal investigator and an experienced interdisciplinary team will build on our NIH funded CBPR projects to collaborate with Chicago Chinese community groups. The findings from this proposal could inform the successful conduct of future research to improve health and wellbeing among US Chinese older adults. Public Health Relevance:  This application aims to conduct a descriptive study to examine the cross sectional associations among intergenerational relationship, discordance, conflicts and stress and social isolation of Chinese older adults in a community-dwelling population. The findings from this study will provide important information on the risk and protective factors associated with health and wellbeing of older Chinese persons.

"TRANSLATION RESEARCH ON CHRONIC DISEASE SELF-MANAGEMENT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal application (Years 06-10) for the Indiana University Edward R. Roybal Center. The lU-Roybal facilitates research on improving support and education for self-management among vulnerable older adults cared for by generalist physicians. This thematic focus stems from our broad experience in designing and studying models of care for physically and socioeconomically vulnerable older adults. Our research recognizes the fundamental role of generalist physicians in providing care to older adults and the fundamental role of patient self-management in achieving excellent outcomes. In the first four years of the lU-Roybal, we supported 17 pilot projects that span cognitive, emotional, and physical domains of health as well as basic and applied research. Three Year 05 projects are now underway. Our pilots have largely operated in a laboratory of Community Health Centers (CHCs), which are part of an expanding national network of publicly-funded primary care sites serving persons regardless of ability to pay. The laboratory facilitates access to end-users (providers and patients and their families) who identify priorities and improve the translational potential of our interventions. Our 17 pilot projects have led to 11 externally funded grants and four pending grants. Translation to clinical pracitce outcomes to date include a cognitive care clinic, a lifestyle self-management program operating in seven CHCs, and a model academic-community research partnership to facilitate translation to clinical practice in an urban public health system. This competing renewal builds on our considerable strengths from the first five years of operations and proposes innovative new pilots and an expansion of our translational science laboratory. The pilots proposed represent use-inspired research that will asses a multi-modal self-management program to prevent or postpone cognitive decline, a study of the social factors that may prevent planned transitions out of nursing homes, decision support to facilitate patient-provider decision-making for complex preventive health services, and expansion of a two-way, interactive group video-conferencing project to promote physical activity among older adults. Each of these pilots addresses lessons learned and new opportunities identified in our first five years of funding. The four proposed pilots, as well as the 20 previous pilots, represent examples of the types of research projects that we will pursue in Years 6-10 of the lU-Roybal and represent the strengths of our real-world clinical laboratory.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Primary care is the site of care where most older adults receive their health care. Older adults often suffer from multiple chronic medical conditions and socioeconomic stressors. The Chronic Care Model identifies self-management as a core tenet in improving patient outcomes. Because there is a paucity of research on supporting patient self-management, we focus the lU-Roybal Center resources on this important topic.",TRANSLATION RESEARCH ON CHRONIC DISEASE

"Epidemiology of Psychological Distress in a Chinese Aging Population This goal of our project is to conduct an epidemiological study to elucidate the relationship between culture factors and psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults. More specifically, we will examine the trajectory of psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults, to quantify the relation between normative responsibilities with their psychological wellbeing, to quantify the degree of influence to which normative responsibilities influences health-related factors associated with psychological wellbeing, and to examine the gender differences.  Our secondary aims are to explore the feasibilities of testing the inter-relations between subjective and physiological measures of psychological wellbeing; and to explore the socio-cultural context in the normative responsibilities. Chinese aging population is increasing rapidly in US and globally. However, there are marked health disparities, especially surround the issues of psychological wellbeing, suicide, violence and elder mistreatment (elder abuse, neglect, financial exploitation and self-neglect).  In addition, there are linguistic and cultural complexities and nuances when studying these issues. Moreover, there has been inadequate grass-root support necessary to empower and enable the Chinese communities to fully participate in the research process as equal partners on culturally sensitive issues. Accordingly, we will build on our prior community-based participatory research to quantify the mechanisms between important cultural factors and the trajectory of psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults. In this application, a culturally capable principal investigator and a multi-institutional interdisciplinary team will build on our prior efforts to collaborate with Chinese community organizations. The findings from this proposal could inform health care professionals, researcher, community, and policy makers to identify risk/protective factors, better understand disease pathway, inform future prevention and intervention studies, and inform the practice and policy to improve psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults. Public Health Relevance:  This proposal will conduct an epidemiological study to quantify the trajectory of older adult�s psychological wellbeing and to examine factors associated with filial responsibilities, family conflict, and psychological wellbeing in Chinese older men and women.

"Costa Rican Health and Retirement Survey    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application proposes to field two waves of a new, nationally representative longitudinal Costa Rican Health and Retirement Survey targeting Costa Rican adults near retirement age, born 1945-1955. This would complement an on-going longitudinal household survey of older Costa Ricans born before 1945 (CRELES). A number of factors make Costa Rica an important site for the study of older adults' health and economic status: (a) Costa Rica has higher life expectancy than even the United States, with lower age-specific mortality rates among adults. The proposed data would allow unique new insight into life-course social and economic determinants of Costa Rica's success, as well as investigation of the bi-directional relationships between health and work among older adults in this exemplar population. (b) Past work has found Costa Rica to have unusually small socioeconomic gradients in health and economic well-being. This project is designed to allow deeper exploration of the role of public and private support underlying these remarkable inequality patterns. (c) Costa Rica experienced one of the earliest and fastest fertility transitions in the developing world, with total fertility dropping from 7.3 births in 1960 to 3.7 by 1976. By focusing on the parental cohorts experiencing this decline, this survey can uniquely advance understanding of the long- term demographic dividends of fertility decline. (d) Costa Rica provides a particularly rich study setting due to the ability to retrospectively and prospectively link the proposed microdata with high quality registries of vital events such as deaths, creating the ability to follow the sampled cohort at low cost indefinitely into the future. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed project would generate a unique new dataset for studying the determinants of longevity in a country considered a success story for having achieved ""good health at low cost."" Furthermore, it would enable detailed study of social and economic conditions surrounding retirement in a country on the leading edge of the aging transition in Latin America.

"Rural Health Clinics in Accountable Care Organizations: Impact on Disparities The proposed longitudinal study investigates the care provided by Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) to older  adults in the Southern region of the U.S., as well as the costs of that care. Accountable Care Organizations  (ACOs) offer potential opportunities to RHCs despite several rural constraints to ACO participation.  However, little is known about how the ACO model accommodates the unique challenges of RHCs, and the  impact of RHC participation on the health disparities of rural older adults including those of minority groups.  The specific aims of the study are: 1) to analyze and describe the extent of RHC participation in ACOs, and  the characteristics of RHCs that choose to participate in ACOs; 2) to analyze ACO participation and other  factors that impact health disparities of rural populations served by RHCs; and 3) to analyze ACO  participation and other factors that impact cost efficiency and preventive care effectiveness for RHC older  adult patients. The major research hypotheses are: 1) A higher percentage of provider-based RHCs will  participate in ACOs compared to independent RHCs; 2) RHCs in networks will be more likely to participate  in ACOs than unaffiliated RHCs; 3) Large RHCs are more likely to participate in ACOs than small RHCs; 4)  RHC participation in ACOs is positively related to reduction of disparities of older adult rural patients,  controlling for the effects of contextual factors; 5) RHC participation in ACOs is positively related to quality of  care practices, controlling for the effects of contextual factors (such as ethnic/racial distribution and rurality);  6) RHC participation in ACOs is positively related to health outcomes of older adult rural patients, controlling  for the effects of contextual factors (such as ethnic/racial distribution and rurality); and 7) RHC participation  in ACOs will have a positive impact on cost efficiency and preventive care effectiveness. We will triangulate  our analyses by using both quantitative and qualitative research methods including analysis of secondary  data, survey research, and case studies. Multivariate analyses of seven years of organizational and  community-related data of a panel of approximately 800 RHCs will be performed in order to develop more  generalizable ideas about the factors contributing to RHC performance and outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) face numerous challenges such as serving communities with higher rates of  chronic disease compared to urban communities, & attracting & retaining qualified professional staff. In  analyzing how RHCs' participation in Accountable Care Organizations affects their performance, this study  will assist policy leaders in making decisions that will strengthen the health care safety net in rural America.",Rural Health Clinics in Accountable Care Organizations: Impact on Disparities,8334558,U24MD006954,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Americas ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Expenditure ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' Ice ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' Rural Health ', ' rural health clinic ', ' Rural Health Centers ', ' Rural Population ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Native Americans ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' meetings ', ' health care organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' payment ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Qualifying ', ' Characteristics ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' underserved rural area ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' safety net ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,U24,2012,485635,0.10822023022501627
"Linking Personality and SES Influences on Lifespan Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this K08 Mentored Career Development Award application, Ben Chapman, PhD, a psychologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC), proposes to integrate approaches from personality psychology and social epidemiology to study socioeconomically (SES) based health disparities across the latter part of life. Proposed are a comprehensive educational plan, original data collection, and secondary analyses of existing datasets designed to equip the applicant to become a leading investigator of how the social stratification in lifespan health trajectories is influenced by individual personality. He will receive formal training in social epidemiology, health and aging, and multilevel statistics through formal coursework and mentored didactics with a team of nationally recognized experts in these areas. Dr. Chapman's research program proposes two scientific aims, based on a synthesis of theory and findings from social epidemiology and personality and health, under a conceptual framework of life course epidemiology. The Aims examine the interaction between personality and SES factors influencing health behaviors and general illness burden across the second half of life. New data collection focuses on how personality influences health under conditions of socioeconomic deprivation, involving 18-24 month follow up of a pilot cohort (N=106) of ethnically diverse, lower SES middle age and older adults currently being accrued. This will provide Dr. Chapman with valuable experience following a small cohort over a short time, in preparation for larger studies, and obtain health data rare in existing data sources, like inflammatory biomarkers. Existing data sources are selected for longitudinal information on personality, SES, and health, permitting well-powered hypothesis tests over the Midlife Development in the US, Hawaii Culture and Health, and Older Adults in Primary Care studies. From a public health view, lifespan health is powerfully tied to social inequalities; but not all disadvantaged people suffer worse, and not all advantaged people enjoy better health as they age. Attention to individual psychological and behavioral dispositions can aid understanding of this heterogeneity. Blending personality and social epidemiology will better illuminate the interface between person and social structure in healthy aging.

"Mechanisms of health disparities in parkinsonism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for an NIA Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development (K23) award seeks support to develop a program of research related to understanding the mechanisms of health disparities in Parkinsonism. As part of the education plan, the PI proposes to: 1) Increase her understanding of health behavior theory, geriatrics and health disparities; 2) Gain additional epidemiological skills in study design and health measurement; and 3) Acquire the analytic skills associated with psychometric and longitudinal data analysis. Along with these educational goals, there is an associated research project.  The principal research objective of this project is to understand the patient-level factors related to healthcare disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinsonian signs. Specifically, this study proposes to evaluate how older adults' aging beliefs affect the recognition of Parkinsonian signs, and how race, culture and socioeconomic status impact this relationship. To achieve these goals, there are three specific aims: 1) To validate a screening instrument for Parkinsonian signs by comparing it with neurological examination; 2) To examine older adults' beliefs regarding movement changes and their association with Parkinsonian signs and relevant patient-level characteristics; and 3) To determine the association between beliefs about aging, subsequent comorbidities, including falls and fractures, and the detection and treatment of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. After validation of a screening instrument for Parkinsonian signs, this measure will be incorporated into a cross-sectional and prospective evaluation of the relationship between aging beliefs and Parkinsonian signs, particularly as it is modified by socioeconomic factors. Subjects will be recruited and surveyed in primary care clinics and outcomes will be determined through the electronic health record. Successful completion of this project will lead to the development of educational interventions targeting improved understanding of aging related functional decline among older adults. This application will provide critical support for the PI to become an independent researcher and a leader in health services research in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aging-related movement problems are common in older adults and lead to increased disability and death. Underserved minorities may be particularly vulnerable to under-recognition and treatment of these movement problems. This research aims to understand why patients may not get appropriate and timely therapy in order to develop public health strategies to improve care for older adults.

"Cost-related Underuse of Medications and the Health of Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cost-related Medication Nonadherence and the Health of Older Adults Becky Briesacher, Ph.D., is a health services researcher and Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently-funded researcher supported by rich mentorship and fruitful collaborations in the area of aging and drug policy. Dr. Briesacher seeks a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) to gain: (1) a better understanding of cost-related medication nonadherence (CRN) and its effect on the health of older adults, and (2) research experience with models that account for irrationality in health behaviors. The candidate proposes a career development plan that provides new training in behavioral economics, targeted exposure to clinical geriatrics, and advanced statistical methods in longitudinal analyses. The research program includes: (1) creating a unique, longitudinal dataset from two national health surveys of older adults, (2) describing the longitudinal course of CRN, including identifying the predictors and potential consequences on patient health and health care expenditures, and (3) developing models of CRN in older adults that incorporate principles from behavioral economics, particularly time-inconsistency. The advanced training and three-part research program will provide the foundation for Dr. Briesacher's transition to an independent investigator in geriatric health services research. In addition, this research program will inform issues central to Medicare Part D prescription drug program and its effects on the health and financial stability of older adults. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Strong evidence shows that medication adherence decreases with higher cost-sharing, yet medication cost- sharing is rising, most notably in Medicare Part D. Discovering how optimal cost-sharing may improve medication adherence has significant implications for the health and welfare of an aging society that is increasingly dependent on medications.

"Effects of Employment on Health and Quality of Life in Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People over 65 years old (65+) are the fastest growing group in the US population, and workers 65+ are increasing in number much more rapidly than any other worker age group. By year 2012, workers 65+ are estimated to comprise 16.7% of US labor force. This group of elderly workers is highly diverse (e.g. racial/ethnic and socio-economic status composition), yet their health status is only beginning to be characterized. Furthermore, careful examination of health-related quality of life of the older worker has been virtually ignored by the occupational health/aging research community. Finally, there has been no systematic research into variations in healthcare costs and utilization in this population, despite systemic concern over rising healthcare costs in the United States. This study proposes to use the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to study the health status, medical expenditures, healthcare utilization, and quality of life of employed older adults. Both datasets contain large representative samples of US adults 65+ (n=386,887 and n=17,396). Both descriptive and analytic modeling are proposed within a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework, taking into account socio-economic determinants of health such as occupational segregation and occupational prestige. The study proposes to:1) characterize health disparities, morbidity, health behaviors and conditions, and health-related quality of life of US workers and non-workers 65+ stratified by age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, health insurance, occupational segregation and prestige, employment status and occupational/industry categories; 2) using SEM, identify sociodemographic and occupational factors (including occupational prestige and segregation) associated with healthcare utilization and expenditures by workers 65+ after adjustment for health behavior, morbidity and health conditions; and 3) using SEM, predict the health- related quality of life in sub-populations of workers 65+ after adjustment for health behavior, morbidity and health conditions. This study is relevant to four out of five National Institute on Aging (NIA) research goals, including: (1) understanding of disease and disability in older adults; (2) aiding in developing interventions to improve their health and quality of life; (3) understanding the implications of an aging society; and (4) identification of health disparities and interventions to decrease these disparities. The findings of the proposed study can be used by policy makers, employers, and other stakeholders to make health-related and employment-related decisions and implement workplace changes and health promotion programs targeting the senior community in order to improve well-being and quality of life of people 65+.        Adults over 65 years old who remain employed past retirement age constitute a rapidly growing and a highly diverse proportion of US older adults, however their health status, healthcare expenditures, and quality of life are only beginning to be characterized. Using innovative advanced statistical techniques this proposal will describe current older worker socio-demographics characteristics, health status, as well as study linkages between occupational status and occupation on one hand, and health status, healthcare utilization and expenditures, and health-related quality of life on the other.

"Delivering a Dose of Hope: A Faith-Based Program to Increase Older African Ameri     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project presents a unique opportunity to evaluate a community based culture-centered program to increase older (ages e 55 years) black/African Americans' participation in clinical research. ""A Dose of Hope,"" will engage one of the most powerful forces for community and personal behavioral change in the South, African American communities of faith. Few interventions designed to increase racial and ethnic minority participation in clinical research have been subjected to rigorous scientific evaluation let alone those tailored for older Americans. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of the multifaceted ""Dose of Hope"" intervention will inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of community-developed interventions on a national level. This project will enroll 2 matched cohorts, of 105 volunteers each, drawn from 6 representative churches across the Atlanta metropolitan area resulting in a sample of 210 participants. Churches will be matched on selected characteristics including denomination type and membership size. The intervention consists of a half-day program with facilitated small group discussions at 3- and 6-month timepoints. The intervention groups will participate in activities that promote knowledge about minorities and their historical experiences in clinical research, group harms, contemporary clinical trial ethics and regulations, and opportunities for community involvement in clinical research. The control groups will receive general printed material about clinical research. All participants will undergo baseline assessment with follow up at 3- and 6- month intervals. The primary outcome of the study will be the difference in proportions of volunteers in the intervention and control groups who enroll in a clinical trial at one-year post-intervention. The results of our study will fill a critical gap in rigorously tested approaches to increase the numbes of older racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials which will help address health disparities and will further our understanding of the influence of social networks on clinical trials participation.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Participation of older black/African Americans in clinical research studies is much lower compared to whites despite the fact that the group is disproportionately impacted by many chronic, degenerative, and infectious diseases.

"Built Environment and Health Care Use: Disparities Among Chronically Ill Elders  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Associations between characteristics of the neighborhoods in which older people live and late-life disparities in chronic illness have been the subject of a rapidly growing field of research. For low-income and minority elders with chronic illness, disparities in access to and quality of care contribute to disparities in the burden of illness. Research on chronic illness has also underscored the links between inadequate physician oversight, potentially preventable hospitalizations, and poor health outcomes. However, little is known about the ways in which neighborhood environmental factors - beyond local supply of medical services - inform how urban older adults with chronic illness use physician services to manage their health. This study addresses this gap by examining the relationships between neighborhood built environment (e.g. walk-ability, access to public transit), use of physician services, and preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits among elderly, chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries who live in New York City. Specifically, the study aims to:  1) Examine associations between neighborhood built environment and physician service use among  urban, chronically ill older adults;  2) Determine whether and to what extent variations in the built environment influence potentially  preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits; and  3) Reassess findings from Aims 1 and 2 by applying: (i) alternative modeling techniques; and (ii) tests of  endogeneity to address the potential sorting of patients into neighborhoods with different characteristics  based on service use and outcomes.  The study will be based on longitudinal analysis of existing data on a sample of NYC-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older, linking individual characteristics and service use measures with small area- level data from other sources. Analyses will focus on patients with congestive heart failure and diabetes - two major contributors to preventable hospitalizations. This study will provide insight into the interdependence of clinical, social, economic, and environmental factors that influence quality of chronic illness care and, ultimately, quality of life, for older adults with multiple co-morbidities. The proposed research will apply and expand on the candidate's training throughout the K01 award period, including advanced methodological training in epidemiology and health economics. The training and research activities will lay the foundation for an R01 application in the later years of the award. Findings from this study and future research will ultimately be applied toward developing effective interventions to improve access to, continuity, and quality of ambulatory care for chronically ill elders living in underserved communities and, in turn, mitigate late-life health disparities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant socio-economic and racial/ethnic disparities exist in the burden of chronic illness among older adults, due partly to disparities in access to and quality of ambulatory care aimed at preventing chronic illness complications. Although prior research has examined geographic variations in health care access across areas such as counties, little is known about how variations in environmental and socio-economic factors at the neighborhood level influence disparities in service use and outcomes among vulnerable groups, particularly low-income and minority elders. This study aims to address this gap by examining the relationships between neighborhood built environment, use of physician services, and preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits among elderly, chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries who live in New York City.",Built Environment and Health Care Use: Disparities Among Chronically Ill Elders,8334079,K01AG039463,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Award ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Catchment Area (Health) ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' Transportation ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' Services ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' social ', ' medical supply ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' beneficiary ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' demographics ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' effective intervention ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' ']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,K01,2012,130340,0.00400776226366246
"Text messages for older African Americans with HIV     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Environment and Health Group (EHG), Inc. in collaboration with our partners: New England Association of HIV over 50, the Massachusetts Statewide Consumer Advisory Board (SWCAB) on HIV/AIDS, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of South Carolina, and Fenway Health Center proposes to develop an innovative, low-cost, tailored, cell phone text message intervention. Currently over 500,000 African Americans are living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, by 2015, people over 50 years of age will account for half of all HIV/AIDS cases in the United States. EHG's proposed intervention will seek to address the lack of evidenced-based interventions for those African Americans, who are over 50, and HIV positive. The program will combine pill reminders (ART and other chronic illness medications) with motivational messages for African Americans, 50 years and older, with HIV. This intervention will address two major barriers to ART adherence among HIV positive older adults: 1) neurocognitive abilities (memory and executive function), 2) affect (attitude and outlook). As well as the cultural barrier of distrust of health care professionals felt by many oldr African Americans. The project is based on EHG's own work in the field of HIV/AIDS and on a need assessment conducted in 2011 that revealed that: 1) text messages and motivational messages were desirable in supporting ART compliance, and 2) text messaging was preferred over computer-based interventions as a means of ART support. In Phase 2, we will conduct a randomized control trial of the cell phone intervention.

A key problem in the fight against HIV/AIDS is the lack of low-cost, evidenced-based interventions for those struggling with the disease. In this Phase I study, we will develop, and test, a novel method to promote adherence to ART and co-occurring chronic illness treatments among HIV positive, African Americans, who are over 50.               ",Text messages for older African Americans with HIV,8329993,R43MD007161,"['Attitude ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' abstracting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Environment ', ' Engineering ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Health ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Computers ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Methods ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' New England ', ' Memory ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Phase ', ' Latino ', ' Chronic ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Universities ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Woman ', ' United States ', ' programs ', ' Life ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Collaborations ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Medical ', ' Sample Size ', ' Individual ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Effectiveness ', ' therapy adherence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' novel ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' computer science ', ' Viral ', ' Text ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pilot trial ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Pill ', ' pill (pharmacologic) ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' Address ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Minority ', ' Regimen ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Affective ', ' treatment adherence ', ' evidence base ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' successful intervention ', ' ']",NIMHD,"ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH GROUP, INC.",R43,2012,174047,-0.00716863649815365
"Quality of Epilepsy Treatment and Costs in Older Americans by Race (QUIET CARE)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As of today, we have limited knowledge on the extent to which older Americans with epilepsy, especially typically disadvantaged minorities, receive antiepileptic drug treatment (AED) and follow-up care that is safe and effective. Epilepsy incidence peaks in older age as well as in childhood, and is higher in some minorities; e.g., it is 80% higher in African American (AA) compared to white Medicare beneficiaries. Appropriate treatment is crucial to optimize the chances of seizure control. Based on adult treatment effectiveness and safety data, the Quality Indicators for Epilepsy Treatment (QUIET) were developed in 2007 to assess quality of care. Previous literature suggests not all racial groups receive QUIET concordant care. In addition, poor AED adherence, also typically more common among minorities, limits seizure control. Improving care and adherence to AED treatment in all older adults with epilepsy has the potential to prevent avoidable seizures and also reduce medical costs. Our long-term goal is to inform and design interventions that improve the health care for older minorities with epilepsy and reduce health care costs associated with preventable events. The objective of this application is to examine the current quality of, and adherence to, AEDs and the current quality of care after recurrent seizures across racial groups of older Americans, and to identify opportunities for quality of care improvements and health care costs reductions as a first step toward the long term goal. The rationale for this research is that it is fundamental to inform the progression toward the national objective of living well with epilepsy and potentially reduce health care costs for the hundreds of thousands Medicare beneficiaries who suffer from this disorder. We plan to accomplish our objective by using Medicare administrative claims and a validated algorithm to identify epilepsy cases from these data, to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Assess quality of AED treatment across racial groups of Medicare beneficiaries with epilepsy. Our hypothesis is that, compared to white beneficiaries, typically disadvantaged minorities (e.g., AAs, Native Americans, Hispanics) are less likely to have QUIET concordant AED treatment and less likely to adhere to AEDs; 2) Determine the quality of care after seizure recurrence across race. We hypothesize that minority beneficiaries are less likely to have QUIET concordant care after recurrent seizures. Using the Behavioral Model of Access to Care, analyses for aims 1 and 2 will determine the contribution to racial disparities of, among others, current features of drug plans and geographic variation in care; and 3) determine if lower health care costs are associated with QUIET concordant care across racial groups. If H1-H3 are correct, we hypothesize that minority beneficiaries will be more likely to have high potentially preventable health care costs. This novel project will have a positive impact because it will provide much needed information to move the field toward improving epilepsy care, reducing disparities and potentially reducing costs for older adults.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding whether older adults across minority groups are receiving the care that maximizes the chances of seizure control and good quality of life is expected to inform interventions for providers and/or patients that will ultimately lead to living well with epilepsy, reduce disparities as well as reduce health care costs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders (NINDS)'s objective of assuring a life with ""no seizure, no side effects"" for all Americans with epilepsy. This is especially important as the US healthcare system deals with an ever increasing number of older adults with epilepsy.              The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding whether older adults across minority groups are receiving the care that maximizes the chances of seizure control and good quality of life is expected to inform interventions for providers and/or patients that will ultimately lead to living well with epilepsy, reduce disparities as well as reduce health care costs.

"Psychological Well Being and Recovery Among Older Hospitalized Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposed study addresses the Program Announcement entitled ""Research on Mind-Body Interactions and Health"" (PA-07-046). Specifically, we address the National Institute on Aging (NIA) interest in exploring associations between psychological well-being and functional ability in older adults hospitalized for acute illness. The Specific Aims of the proposed application are to: 1. Examine change in functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. Functional status will be assessed by a battery of measures (a 4 meter walk, a test of grip strength, knee extensor strength and seven activities of daily living (ADLs)) at 5 time points: within 24 hours of hospital admission and discharge, and 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge. 2. Examine direct and indirect associations between psychological well-being and functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. Psychological well-being, assessed by a 6- domain psychological well-being instrument and a positive affect summary scale, will be used to examine patterns of association with functional status over the 5 time points outlined in aim 1. 3. Examine whether psychological well-being modifies ethnic health disparities associated with functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. This aim will allow us to examine how ethnic group (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics) interacts with psychological well-being to influence functional status over the 5 time points outlined in aim 1. To explore our aims, we plan to follow up an ethnically diverse sample of 800 older patients (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics) admitted to the Acute Care for Elders (ACE) unit at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Older adults enrolled in the study will be assessed at five time points: within 24 hours of hospital admission, within 24 hours of hospital discharge and 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge. The five time points will allow us not only to examine overall patterns of effect between functional status and psychological well-being but it will also allow us to examine patterns of effect over distinct time periods including hospitalization and post discharge. The three post discharge follow up interviews will further allow us to examine and explain associations between functional status and psychological well-being in relation to short (1 month) and longer term (6 and 12 month) recovery patterns. A central goal of the current application is to examine whether psychological well-being can influence the risk for functional status decline associated with hospitalization in an ethnically diverse older patient population.

"Reducing disability via a bundled bio-behavioral-environmental approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disability in older adults is a major public health problem, particularly among low-income urban people of color. Most disabled older adults strongly prefer to live at home, but many require nursing home admission due to limitation in basic or instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs or IADLs). Since these costly admissions are preventable, testing novel, cost-effective interventions to improve ADLs should be a public health priority. Previous research has not comprehensively addressed individuals and the environment in which they function yet low income older adults suffer from health disparities in both their function and their home environments. We propose a two-group randomized trial to test the efficacy of our bio-behavioral-environmental intervention, Community Aging in Place - Advancing Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE), which combines evidence-based nursing, occupational therapy, and handyman components. In a randomized controlled pilot trial, the CAPABLE intervention had preliminary effect sizes of 0.63 and 0.62 for reducing difficulty in ADLs and IADLs respectively, when comparing the mean changes in the intervention group to the control group from baseline to follow up. These pilot findings warrant an efficacy trial. We will recruit low-income older (eage 65), principally African-American, adults with e 1 ADL or e 2 IADL limitations from the Baltimore Department of Housing Energy Assistance Program. We will interview them at home and randomize participants to either the treatment (CAPABLE intervention) or control (attention-control) group. Participants in the treatment group will receiv up to 10 in-home sessions -- d6 visits with an occupational therapist and d4 visits from a nurse - and d$1200 in safety and modification services from a licensed handyman. Each treatment participant will receive each intervention component but interventionists will systematically tailo content to the participants' risk profile and goals based on protocols. Participants in the control group will receive an equivalent number of visits, which will consist of sedentary activities with  trained research assistant (RA). All participants will be reassessed at 16 and 52 weeks in person by an RA masked to treatment condition. The primary endpoint is the ability to complete ADLs and IADLs without difficulty at 16 weeks post-randomization. Other endpoints include lower extremity mobility, health-related quality of life, and home safety at 16 weeks and ADL and IADL limitations at 52 weeks post-randomization. We will examine moderators of treatment success and mediating mechanisms. We will also evaluate cost-effectiveness based on the cost of the intervention and health care utilization. The study is designed to detect clinically meaningful improvement in ADL or IADL limitations between the intervention and control group with 80 percent power (alpha = 0.05) in an intention to treat analysis. The innovative study will provide economic evidence for a theory-driven intervention that could rein in costs of a growing and increasingly diverse older adult population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disability in older adults is a major public health problem, particularly among low-income, urban people of color.

"Inpatient Rehabilitation Outcomes in Medicare Hip Fracture Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To date, policy directives based on anecdotal reports, drive utilization and treatment decisions. Although hip fracture is considered by Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as a medically appropriate diagnosis for Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) care, little evidence is available to support this assumption. Building on sparse existing evidence, the overall objective of this project is to determine which client and system characteristics result in improved rehabilitation outcomes. An analytic file using two large national datasets, the CMS Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility - Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI) and the Provider of Service (POS) file, will be constructed to test regression models of factors that may explain differences in rehabilitation outcomes between two time points, admission and discharge from IRFs. Using the Andersen's Model for Health Services Use as the conceptual framework, the proposed longitudinal study aims to: (1) determine the influence of individual characteristics (Predisposing: age, gender, race), (Enabling: social support), (Need: functional status and cognitive status on admission, and comorbidities) on rehabilitation outcomes (motor functioning, functional status and discharged home) for Medicare beneficiaries with hip fracture in IRFs; and (2) determine the influence of contextual characteristics (type, size, location, ownership and nurse staffing) on IRF aggregate rehabilitation outcomes (motor functioning, functional status, and discharge home), controlling for the influence of aggregate individual characteristics (Predisposing, Enabling and Need) of Medicare beneficiaries with hip fracture in IRFs. This study will inform the policy debate on which types of patients are most appropriate for IRFs and will determine the effectiveness of IRFs in delivering rehabilitative treatment based on specific individual and contextual characteristics associated with rehabilitative outcomes among hip fracture patients and vulnerable subgroups (i.e., racial/ethnic minorities, older adults without adequate social support and those 85 years and older). Of particular concern is determining the evidence base to indicate that such effectiveness will result in positive outcomes among racial/ethnic minorities. Given the growing national interest in health disparities, it becomes increasingly important to determine if there are differences in outcomes based on race/ethnicity. Health disparities remain a major research focus of the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR). The proposed research and subsequent analysis will add to the current body of nursing knowledge by identifying characteristics that better inform interventions that look to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities.        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that more than 350,000 hip fractures occur annually in the US with a lifetime attributable cost of $81,300 from a hip fracture, including care provided during acute hospitalization and across the post-acute continuum (inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing and home health). For many older adults, the personal costs of a fractured hip results in chronic disability and complications, loss of independent ambulation, functional dependence and death. With the growing numbers of older adults and the complexity of their health conditions, appropriate and effective geriatric rehabilitation services are needed. The nation's baby boomers will be turning age 65 in 2011 and will bring about major demographic changes which will certainly influence the delivery of health care. Consequently, in order to effectively care for an aging population with increasing rates of injury and chronic diseases, nurses and other health care providers require the evidence base indicating ""what"" is effective and ""why."" Outcomes from the proposed study may be used in systematic reviews and meta-analyses to inform policy decisions about the appropriateness of care which looks to optimize outcomes based on valid clinical endpoints.

"Health Care Partners in Cancer Prevention and Care Among Aged - Competing Renewal    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We plan to implement a novel, community based educational program to inform and motivate underserved older adults to forge partnerships with their doctors, targeting cancer prevention as a shared goal. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will evaluate the efficacy of our social learning theory based intervention that promotes patient participation in order to enhance patient centered medical care. This study builds on findings of our ongoing study of Health Care Partnerships in Cancer Prevention and Care. Specifically we propose a multi-modal health communication training program for older adults. This educational intervention (""Speak Up"" program), aims to improve patient initiative, competence, and confidence in communication with physicians. Based on foundations of social learning theory the intervention is expected to result in increased discussion between older adults and their primary care physicians about cancer prevention and screening. Participants in the intervention are also expected to receive more age and risk specific preventive advice from their doctors and report greater satisfaction with their health care. Participants in the ""Speak Up"" facilitated discussion groups (N=480) will be compared to participants in ""Connect"" attention control groups (N=480). The latter program addresses important goals of enhancing civic and social engagement. The intervention program will be conducted in small groups and offer user-friendly experiential learning including information, discussion, and role play in order to help older persons develop better communication skills. The study will be conducted among randomly selected community dwelling elders who had participated in our prior research, and among community based older adults who attend Senior Center nutrition programs, sponsored by Area Agencies on Aging (AAA). Based on comparing pre-intervention assessments with 2 week, 6 month, and 12 month telephone follow-up evaluations, we will determine both the short term and long term impact of the intervention. We will consider participants' personal characteristics and their physicians' background and supportiveness as they may influence uptake of the intervention. We designed the study based on intervention research (CONSORT) guidelines for conducting RCTs, and will carefully evaluate treatment fidelity. In addition to patient reported outcomes, we will also consider objective indices based on Medicare claims data and AAA data on program utilization. We will use multilevel models with fixed and random effects in our quantitative data analyses. Using a mixed methods design, we will also include a qualitative study component based on in-depth interviews with 60 participants selected based on high versus low program benefits. Our study is closely aligned with the mission of the National Cancer Institute to improve cancer control and to reduce health disparities in cancer prevention and care. We plan an active dissemination effort to insure that this portable and cost effective intervention may be widely adopted by community organizations such as Area Agencies on Aging that serve diverse older adults.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study has direct relevance to public health. Our goal is to improve older patients' advocacy skills and their ability to communicate with their physicians regarding cancer prevention and general medical care. We expect that the confidence and initiative they will acquire as a result of our intervention will result in improvements in the preventive care they will receive. Having well informed patients, who also respect physician expertise, participating in medical encounters, will improve both efficiency and effectiveness of office visits for the aged. Prevention and early detection of cancer have been recognized as important public health strategies for reducing the burden of chronic and life threatening illnesses, both on society and on individuals. Our focus on communication skills training among low health literacy and minority elders should also contribute to minimizing health disparities.

"Older adults in vulnerable communities: Health and quality of life over time     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diversity, its growth and complexity, are defining features of the dramatic aging of the world-wide population. Research demonstrates that older adults from disadvantaged populations are at elevated risk of poor health, disability and premature death. The National Institutes of Health are committed to reducing and eliminating health disparities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that health disparities related to sexual orientation are one of the main gaps in health disparities research. Existing evidence demonstrates that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) older adults are an at-risk, under-investigated and under-served health disparate population. This study will examine the determinants of health impacting LGB older adults to assess change in health and quality of life (QOL) over time. Based on an innovative resilience conceptual framework, the pro- posed longitudinal research will obtain data from 2,000 LGB older adults who participated in the original study in order to allow us to understand the inter-relationships between risk and protective factors as well as cohort effects as they impact health and QOL of LGB older adults over time. This multidisciplinary collaboration of University of Washington researchers and community-based collaborators addresses a critical gap by identifying modifiable mechanisms impacting health and QOL over time. The primary goals of the project are as follows: 1) Investigate how lifetime victimization, everyday discrimination, stress (perceived stress and physiological response to stress) and health behavior change affects health and QOL of LGB older adults over time; 2) Evaluate how social relations (time-varying) and sexual identity management (time-varying) affect the associations among everyday discrimination, stress, health and QOL over time; and, 3) Test whether there is cohort heterogeneity in overall levels and age growth trajectories of health and QOL, and to what extent the differences in experiences within a historical context (e.g., time of sexual identity disclosure, lifetime victimization) between Baby Boom and Silent Generation LGB older adults account for these cohort effects. As the population ages, the health care costs associated with health disparities will continue to rise. To respond to this growing public health challenge it is imperative to identfy groups at high risk of disparities and to determine the modifiable mechanisms impacting their health and QOL as they age. The findings from this project will generate needed information to directly inform and guide the development of tailored interventions that can be effectively delivered within community-based agency settings to improve the health and QOL of demographically diverse older adults.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the population ages, the health care costs associated with health disparities continue to rise.

"Mobile Telecare for Underserved African-American Elders with Heart Failure  Title: Mobile Telecare for Underserved African-American Elders with Heart Failure Abstract Older adults who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid are among the sickest and poorest individuals covered in either program. Although they have a significantly higher prevalence of chronic conditions, such as heart failure (HF) than all other Medicare beneficiaries, as few as 2% of dual eligible patients receive the type of case management or care coordination that can prevent hospitalizations and emergency department visits for acute medical problems. African-Americans are particularly at risk, having the highest rates of HF-related hospitalizations compared to all other Medicare beneficiaries. In this Phase I SBIR, we will conduct a pilot clinical trial to test a care coordination program designed for African-American dual eligible older adults with HF who have been discharged from a regional hospital and who are being cared for by community-based health care providers. The proposed Mobile Heart Care Coordination (MHCC) program integrates telemonitoring through a Bluetooth-enabled device and mobile phone-based communication technologies that connect hospital-based cardiac care teams with community-based providers. The goal of the program is to provide coordinated post-discharge care in order to reduce potentially-avoidable hospitalizations and emergency room visits. This Phase I SBIR will develop and test the MHCC intervention's feasibility and short-term outcomes for dual eligible African-Americans with HF. In a Phase II application, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial with African-American dual-eligible older adults with HF to determine whether participants in the MHCC- enhanced program are less likely to be readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge (primary hypothesis) and less likely to access emergency room care (secondary hypothesis) compared to the comparison group (usual care). The Phase I application will provide the necessary data to determine the sample size required for the larger adequately powered randomized controlled trial in Phase II. The subsequent Phase II application will result in an innovative, cost-effective, and nationally replicable care coordination model aimed at reducing potentially-avoidable hospitalizations and emergency room visits, and improving quality of care for all African- American dual eligible patients with HF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Phase I intervention tests a culturally tailored, community-based, low cost intervention that relies on telemonitoring and communication technologies to improve care coordination and reduce potentially- avoidable costly hospitalizations and emergency room visits for African-American dual eligibles with heart failure. If successful, this intervention offers a cost-effective model for significantly reducing health disparities among nearly 200,000 African-American dual eligibles with heart failure nationwide as well as other older adult African Americans with HF.            ",Mobile Telecare for Underserved African-American Elders with Heart Failure,8549599,R43MD008661,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Attitude ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' meeting reports ', ' Congresses ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Heart ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Medicaid ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Solutions ', ' South Carolina ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Case Management ', ' Managed Care ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' care seeking ', ' intervention program ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' payment ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' telecare ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Qualifying ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Cardiac ', ' beneficiary ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' health literacy ', ' comparison group ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community based care ', ' dual eligible ', ' collaborative care ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' successful intervention ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' randomized trial ', ' phase II study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' ']",NIMHD,"ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH GROUP, INC.",R43,2013,186404,0.0539231563192911
"Community Choirs to Promote Healthy Aging and Independence of Older Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The United States is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults. In 2009, there were 39.6 million individuals over age 65, and this number is expected to almost double by 2030. During the same time period, there will be an increase in the number of older adults with diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds who are at increased risk for poor health outcomes relative to non-minority elders. Thus, there is an immediate need to identify cost-effective, widely applicable, and sustainable programs that promote health and well-being of older adults. A growing body of literature suggests that participation in community choral singing may also have positive health benefits for older adults, but there is a need to evaluate the efficacy of a choral program for diverse older adults, and a well-designed randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to help strengthen the evidence base. Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to test the efficacy of community choir program for maintaining health and well-being in culturally diverse older adults. To address the aims of the study, we will evaluate a comprehensive set of outcomes that are hypothesized to be related to choral singing and complete a cost analysis. We will recruit 450 diverse older adults and will utilize 12 existing Administration on Aging-supported senior centers to implement a multi-site, randomized (by center) clinical trial (RCT). Centers will be randomized to receive the choir program immediately (intervention group) or after a 6-month delayed intervention phase (control group). The community choirs will be led by professional music directors. We will assess both primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 months (and 18 months for the delayed intervention group). We will also evaluate the start- up and ongoing program costs for senior centers, including cost/person served and determine quality adjusted life years. If successful, results from this RCT may help develop and further the premise that creative arts can be applied to helping solve national health priorities, such as keeping older adults active, independent, and involved in their communities in readily accessible, affordable, and sustainable ways.          The United States is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, a group that is at increased risk of poor health relative to non-minorities.

"Text messages for older African Americans with HIV  Abstract Environment and Health Group (EHG), Inc. in collaboration with our partners: New England Association of HIV over 50, the Massachusetts Statewide Consumer Advisory Board (SWCAB) on HIV/AIDS, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of South Carolina, and Fenway Health Center proposes to develop an innovative, low-cost, tailored, cell phone text message intervention. Currently over 500,000 African Americans are living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, by 2015, people over 50 years of age will account for half of all HIV/AIDS cases in the United States. EHG's proposed intervention will seek to address the lack of evidenced-based interventions for those African Americans, who are over 50, and HIV positive. The program will combine pill reminders (ART and other chronic illness medications) with motivational messages for African Americans, 50 years and older, with HIV. This intervention will address two major barriers to ART adherence among HIV positive older adults : 1) neurocognitive abilities (memory and executive function), 2) affect (attitude and outlook). as well as the cultural barrier of distrust of health care professionals felt by many older African Americans. The project is based on EHG's own work in the field of HIV/AIDS and on a needs assessment conducted in 2011 that revealed that: 1) text messages and motivational messages were desirable in supporting ART compliance, and 2) text messaging was preferred over computer-based interventions as a means of ART support. In Phase 2, we will conduct a randomized control trial of the cell phone intervention. This second phase of the study will include local pharmacies as partners.   Project Narrative Currently, over 1 million Americans are infected with HIV/AIDS, and African Americans account for more than half of these infections. A key problem in the fight against HIV/AIDS is the lack of low-cost, evidenced-based interventions for those struggling with the disease. In this Phase I study, we will develop, and test, a novel method to promote adherence to ART and co-occurring chronic illness treatments among HIV positive, African Americans, who are over 50.

"Health Care Partners in Cancer Prevention and Care Among Aged - Competing Renewal    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We plan to implement a novel, community based educational program to inform and motivate underserved older adults to forge partnerships with their doctors, targeting cancer prevention as a shared goal. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will evaluate the efficacy of our social learning theory based intervention that promotes patient participation in order to enhance patient centered medical care. This study builds on findings of our ongoing study of Health Care Partnerships in Cancer Prevention and Care. Specifically we propose a multi-modal health communication training program for older adults. This educational intervention (""Speak Up"" program), aims to improve patient initiative, competence, and confidence in communication with physicians. Based on foundations of social learning theory the intervention is expected to result in increased discussion between older adults and their primary care physicians about cancer prevention and screening. Participants in the intervention are also expected to receive more age and risk specific preventive advice from their doctors and report greater satisfaction with their health care. Participants in the ""Speak Up"" facilitated discussion groups (N=480) will be compared to participants in ""Connect"" attention control groups (N=480). The latter program addresses important goals of enhancing civic and social engagement. The intervention program will be conducted in small groups and offer user-friendly experiential learning including information, discussion, and role play in order to help older persons develop better communication skills. The study will be conducted among randomly selected community dwelling elders who had participated in our prior research, and among community based older adults who attend Senior Center nutrition programs, sponsored by Area Agencies on Aging (AAA). Based on comparing pre-intervention assessments with 2 week, 6 month, and 12 month telephone follow-up evaluations, we will determine both the short term and long term impact of the intervention. We will consider participants' personal characteristics and their physicians' background and supportiveness as they may influence uptake of the intervention. We designed the study based on intervention research (CONSORT) guidelines for conducting RCTs, and will carefully evaluate treatment fidelity. In addition to patient reported outcomes, we will also consider objective indices based on Medicare claims data and AAA data on program utilization. We will use multilevel models with fixed and random effects in our quantitative data analyses. Using a mixed methods design, we will also include a qualitative study component based on in-depth interviews with 60 participants selected based on high versus low program benefits. Our study is closely aligned with the mission of the National Cancer Institute to improve cancer control and to reduce health disparities in cancer prevention and care.

"Rural Health Clinics in Accountable Care Organizations: Impact on Disparities The proposed longitudinal study investigates the care provided by Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) to older  adults in the Southern region of the U.S., as well as the costs of that care. Accountable Care Organizations  (ACOs) offer potential opportunities to RHCs despite several rural constraints to ACO participation.  However, little is known about how the ACO model accommodates the unique challenges of RHCs, and the  impact of RHC participation on the health disparities of rural older adults including those of minority groups.  The specific aims of the study are: 1) to analyze and describe the extent of RHC participation in ACOs, and  the characteristics of RHCs that choose to participate in ACOs; 2) to analyze ACO participation and other  factors that impact health disparities of rural populations served by RHCs; and 3) to analyze ACO  participation and other factors that impact cost efficiency and preventive care effectiveness for RHC older  adult patients. The major research hypotheses are: 1) A higher percentage of provider-based RHCs will  participate in ACOs compared to independent RHCs; 2) RHCs in networks will be more likely to participate  in ACOs than unaffiliated RHCs; 3) Large RHCs are more likely to participate in ACOs than small RHCs; 4)  RHC participation in ACOs is positively related to reduction of disparities of older adult rural patients,  controlling for the effects of contextual factors; 5) RHC participation in ACOs is positively related to quality of  care practices, controlling for the effects of contextual factors (such as ethnic/racial distribution and rurality);  6) RHC participation in ACOs is positively related to health outcomes of older adult rural patients, controlling  for the effects of contextual factors (such as ethnic/racial distribution and rurality); and 7) RHC participation  in ACOs will have a positive impact on cost efficiency and preventive care effectiveness. We will triangulate  our analyses by using both quantitative and qualitative research methods including analysis of secondary  data, survey research, and case studies. Multivariate analyses of seven years of organizational and  community-related data of a panel of approximately 800 RHCs will be performed in order to develop more  generalizable ideas about the factors contributing to RHC performance and outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) face numerous challenges such as serving communities with higher rates of  chronic disease compared to urban communities, & attracting & retaining qualified professional staff.

"Epidemiology of Suicidal Behavior in Racially/Ethnically Diverse Older Americans  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This application is in response to RFA-MD-12-001: NIMHD Health Disparities Research. One of the priority areas of this RFA is the study of health conditions associated with significant mortality that have been understudied in health disparity populations. In older Americans, suicide rates are 30% higher than in the general population, and five times higher in non-Hispanic white men age 85 years or older-as the nation continues to grow and racially/ethnically diversify with age so will the rates of suicide. Yet, little is known about suicide-related behaviors (i.e., ideation, plans, and attempts) in older adults, which are strong risk factors for actual suicide and strong indicators of extreme emotional and mental distress. Even more so, differences in suicidal behavior by race/ethnicity have hardly been investigated at all, as most studies are from non-diverse clinic samples. Moreover, most of what we know about mental health services use related to suicide risk in older Americans comes from small non-diverse samples of suicide completers. However, understanding mental health services use and racial disparities in use is important, as all aging adults with emotional and mental distress related to suicidal thoughts and behaviors may benefit from service use and treatment. The proposed project will investigate the prevalence and predictors of suicidal ideation and related behaviors over the lifetime of older racially and ethnically diverse adults, that is, capturing transitions from ideation to plans and attempts and examining risk of late life and current suicidal behavior. It will also investigate mental health services use in those at increased risk of suicide. The aims will be addressed by studying three nationally representative aggregated data sets: 1) the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), a probability sample of the general U.S.; 2) the National Survey of American Life (NSAL), a probability sample of African- American, Afro-Caribbean, and non-Hispanic White Americans; and 3) the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), a probability sample of Latinos and Asian Americans. The project proposes to make innovative use of the combined data and examine a large, nationally-based cohort of over 3,600 respondents aged 55 and older. In a very cost-efficient approach, this project will be the first comprehensive examination of the prevalence and predictors of suicide-related behaviors and mental health services use in older Americans. Key predictors, including sociodemographic variables, psychiatric disorders, and chronic medical conditions associated with suicidal behavior will be determined (Aims 1 and 2)-assessing differences of associations overall and by race/ethnicity, that is, in older non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. In addition, racial disparities will be assessed separately for men and women (Aim 3), and key predictors of mental health services use will be examined overall and by race/ethnicity (Aim 4). Information stemming from this project will be important for identifying those older adults most at risk of suicide and with great need of care-helping to define national priorities for suicide prevention in late life for all Americans.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicidal risk profoundly impacts individuals, families, and society. Knowledge gained from this proposal will be both novel and critical for understanding the occurrence and predictors of suicide-related behaviors (i.e., ideation, planning, and attempts) in older Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White Americans, including use of mental health services in those at increased risk of suicide. Thus, this proposed project will have unique public health importance, because it will provide evidence for future psychiatric research and policy planning that will help to define national priorities for suicide prevention in late life for all Americans.",Epidemiology of Suicidal Behavior in Racially/Ethnically Diverse Older Americans,8734507,R01MD007019,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Anxiety ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Moods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Societies ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Respondent ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' stem ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2013,30367,0.04885192397603233
"Quality of Epilepsy Treatment and Costs in Older Americans by Race (QUIET CARE)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As of today, we have limited knowledge on the extent to which older Americans with epilepsy, especially typically disadvantaged minorities, receive antiepileptic drug treatment (AED) and follow-up care that is safe and effective. Epilepsy incidence peaks in older age as well as in childhood, and is higher in some minorities; e.g., it is 80% higher in African American (AA) compared to white Medicare beneficiaries. Appropriate treatment is crucial to optimize the chances of seizure control. Based on adult treatment effectiveness and safety data, the Quality Indicators for Epilepsy Treatment (QUIET) were developed in 2007 to assess quality of care. Previous literature suggests not all racial groups receive QUIET concordant care. In addition, poor AED adherence, also typically more common among minorities, limits seizure control. Improving care and adherence to AED treatment in all older adults with epilepsy has the potential to prevent avoidable seizures and also reduce medical costs. Our long-term goal is to inform and design interventions that improve the health care for older minorities with epilepsy and reduce health care costs associated with preventable events. The objective of this application is to examine the current quality of, and adherence to, AEDs and the current quality of care after recurrent seizures across racial groups of older Americans, and to identify opportunities for quality of care improvements and health care costs reductions as a first step toward the long term goal. The rationale for this research is that it is fundamental to inform the progression toward the national objective of living well with epilepsy and potentially reduce health care costs for the hundreds of thousands Medicare beneficiaries who suffer from this disorder. We plan to accomplish our objective by using Medicare administrative claims and a validated algorithm to identify epilepsy cases from these data, to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Assess quality of AED treatment across racial groups of Medicare beneficiaries with epilepsy. Our hypothesis is that, compared to white beneficiaries, typically disadvantaged minorities (e.g., AAs, Native Americans, Hispanics) are less likely to have QUIET concordant AED treatment and less likely to adhere to AEDs; 2) Determine the quality of care after seizure recurrence across race. We hypothesize that minority beneficiaries are less likely to have QUIET concordant care after recurrent seizures. Using the Behavioral Model of Access to Care, analyses for aims 1 and 2 will determine the contribution to racial disparities of, among others, current features of drug plans and geographic variation in care; and 3) determine if lower health care costs are associated with QUIET concordant care across racial groups. If H1-H3 are correct, we hypothesize that minority beneficiaries will be more likely to have high potentially preventable health care costs. This novel project will have a positive impact because it will provide much needed information to move the field toward improving epilepsy care, reducing disparities and potentially reducing costs for older adults.          The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding whether older adults across minority groups are receiving the care that maximizes the chances of seizure control and good quality of life is expected to inform interventions for providers and/or patients that will ultimately lead to living well with epilepsy, reduce disparities as well as reduce health care costs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders (NINDS)'s objective of assuring a life with ""no seizure, no side effects"" for all Americans with epilepsy. This is especially important as the US healthcare system deals with an ever increasing number of older adults with epilepsy.

"Ideal Affect and Health Decision Making Across the Lifespan    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the number of minorities and older adults in the U.S. increase, it is increasingly important to reduce health care disparities among these groups. Recent reports have shown that ethnic disparities in health care utilization, such as successful patient-physician communication and engagement in preventative behaviors, are especially critical for older adults. Optimal health care depends on whether an individual chooses to follow their doctors' recommendations, adhere to prescribed treatments, and engage in health promotion programs. Understanding cultural and age-related differences in how these choices are made can help to reduce disparities in health care. The proposed program of research will test applications of Affect Valuation Theory (AVT) as a theoretical foundation for understanding cultural and age-related differences in how health care decisions are made. AVT suggests that variation in ""ideal affect"" (i.e., the affective states that people value) may contribute to cultural and age-related differences in health care decisions. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) Examine the relationship between ideal affect and health care decisions; and (2) Determine whether cultural and age-related differences in ideal affect may in part account for differences in health care decisions. Using both survey and experimental methods, we will investigate the relationship between ideal affect and health decision making across the life span for two distinct cultural groups, European American and Chinese American. First, we will measure how ideal affect influences health care decision making among participants ranging in age from 21 to 80. Then, we will manipulate ideal affect and subsequently assess preferences for health care options. Findings from these studies will establish the role of ideal affect and health care decision making as a potential mechanism for explaining ethnic health disparities across the life span.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By understanding how ideal affect influences decision making across age and cultural groups, the proposed research will help to develop more culturally sensitive and appropriate treatments and interventions. Thus, integrating ideal affect into the improvement of health care programs may address the needs of diverse populations more adequately.

"Epidemiology of Psychological Distress in a Chinese Aging Population This goal of our project is to conduct an epidemiological study to elucidate the relationship between culture factors and psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults. More specifically, we will examine the trajectory of psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults, to quantify the relation between normative responsibilities with their psychological wellbeing, to quantify the degree of influence to which normative responsibilities influences health-related factors associated with psychological wellbeing, and to examine the gender differences.  Our secondary aims are to explore the feasibilities of testing the inter-relations between subjective and physiological measures of psychological wellbeing; and to explore the socio-cultural context in the normative responsibilities. Chinese aging population is increasing rapidly in US and globally. However, there are marked health disparities, especially surround the issues of psychological wellbeing, suicide, violence and elder mistreatment (elder abuse, neglect, financial exploitation and self-neglect).  In addition, there are linguistic and cultural complexities and nuances when studying these issues. Moreover, there has been inadequate grass-root support necessary to empower and enable the Chinese communities to fully participate in the research process as equal partners on culturally sensitive issues. Accordingly, we will build on our prior community-based participatory research to quantify the mechanisms between important cultural factors and the trajectory of psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults. In this application, a culturally capable principal investigator and a multi-institutional interdisciplinary team will build on our prior efforts to collaborate with Chinese community organizations. The findings from this proposal could inform health care professionals, researcher, community, and policy makers to identify risk/protective factors, better understand disease pathway, inform future prevention and intervention studies, and inform the practice and policy to improve psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults. Public Health Relevance:  This proposal will conduct an epidemiological study to quantify the trajectory of older adult�s psychological wellbeing and to examine factors associated with filial responsibilities, family conflict, and psychological wellbeing in Chinese older men and women.

"Community Choirs to Promote Healthy Aging and Independence of Older Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The United States is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults. In 2009, there were 39.6 million individuals over age 65, and this number is expected to almost double by 2030. During the same time period, there will be an increase in the number of older adults with diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds who are at increased risk for poor health outcomes relative to non-minority elders. Thus, there is an immediate need to identify cost-effective, widely applicable, and sustainable programs that promote health and well-being of older adults. A growing body of literature suggests that participation in community choral singing may also have positive health benefits for older adults, but there is a need to evaluate the efficacy of a choral program for diverse older adults, and a well-designed randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to help strengthen the evidence base. Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to test the efficacy of community choir program for maintaining health and well-being in culturally diverse older adults. To address the aims of the study, we will evaluate a comprehensive set of outcomes that are hypothesized to be related to choral singing and complete a cost analysis. We will recruit 450 diverse older adults and will utilize 12 existing Administration on Aging-supported senior centers to implement a multi-site, randomized (by center) clinical trial (RCT). Centers will be randomized to receive the choir program immediately (intervention group) or after a 6-month delayed intervention phase (control group). The community choirs will be led by professional music directors. We will assess both primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 months (and 18 months for the delayed intervention group). We will also evaluate the start- up and ongoing program costs for senior centers, including cost/person served and determine quality adjusted life years. If successful, results from this RCT may help develop and further the premise that creative arts can be applied to helping solve national health priorities, such as keeping older adults active, independent, and involved in their communities in readily accessible, affordable, and sustainable ways.          The United States is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, a group that is at increased risk of poor health relative to non-minorities. There is an immediate need to identify cost-effective, widely applicable, and sustainable programs that promote health, wellbeing and independence and that are appropriate for our increasingly diverse population of older adults.

"Delivering a Dose of Hope: A Faith-Based Program to Increase Older African Ameri     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project presents a unique opportunity to evaluate a community based culture-centered program to increase older (ages e 55 years) black/African Americans' participation in clinical research. ""A Dose of Hope,"" will engage one of the most powerful forces for community and personal behavioral change in the South, African American communities of faith. Few interventions designed to increase racial and ethnic minority participation in clinical research have been subjected to rigorous scientific evaluation let alone those tailored for older Americans. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of the multifaceted ""Dose of Hope"" intervention will inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of community-developed interventions on a national level. This project will enroll 2 matched cohorts, of 105 volunteers each, drawn from 6 representative churches across the Atlanta metropolitan area resulting in a sample of 210 participants. Churches will be matched on selected characteristics including denomination type and membership size. The intervention consists of a half-day program with facilitated small group discussions at 3- and 6-month timepoints. The intervention groups will participate in activities that promote knowledge about minorities and their historical experiences in clinical research, group harms, contemporary clinical trial ethics and regulations, and opportunities for community involvement in clinical research. The control groups will receive general printed material about clinical research. All participants will undergo baseline assessment with follow up at 3- and 6- month intervals. The primary outcome of the study will be the difference in proportions of volunteers in the intervention and control groups who enroll in a clinical trial at one-year post-intervention. The results of our study will fill a critical gap in rigorously tested approaches to increase the numbes of older racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials which will help address health disparities and will further our understanding of the influence of social networks on clinical trials participation.          Participation of older black/African Americans in clinical research studies is much lower compared to whites despite the fact that the group is disproportionately impacted by many chronic, degenerative, and infectious diseases. ""A Dose of Hope"" was created to increase diversity and participation in research trials through engagement with black/African American communities of faith. Our goal is to understand if the ""Dose of Hope"" program is effective in achieving greater enrollment of older blacks in clinical studies, and what elements of the program specifically contribute to the realization of greater enrollment of this group.

"Reducing disability via a bundled bio-behavioral-environmental approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disability in older adults is a major public health problem, particularly among low-income urban people of color. Most disabled older adults strongly prefer to live at home, but many require nursing home admission due to limitation in basic or instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs or IADLs). Since these costly admissions are preventable, testing novel, cost-effective interventions to improve ADLs should be a public health priority. Previous research has not comprehensively addressed individuals and the environment in which they function yet low income older adults suffer from health disparities in both their function and their home environments. We propose a two-group randomized trial to test the efficacy of our bio-behavioral-environmental intervention, Community Aging in Place - Advancing Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE), which combines evidence-based nursing, occupational therapy, and handyman components. In a randomized controlled pilot trial, the CAPABLE intervention had preliminary effect sizes of 0.63 and 0.62 for reducing difficulty in ADLs and IADLs respectively, when comparing the mean changes in the intervention group to the control group from baseline to follow up. These pilot findings warrant an efficacy trial. We will recruit low-income older (eage 65), principally African-American, adults with e 1 ADL or e 2 IADL limitations from the Baltimore Department of Housing Energy Assistance Program. We will interview them at home and randomize participants to either the treatment (CAPABLE intervention) or control (attention-control) group. Participants in the treatment group will receiv up to 10 in-home sessions -- d6 visits with an occupational therapist and d4 visits from a nurse - and d$1200 in safety and modification services from a licensed handyman. Each treatment participant will receive each intervention component but interventionists will systematically tailo content to the participants' risk profile and goals based on protocols. Participants in the control group will receive an equivalent number of visits, which will consist of sedentary activities with  trained research assistant (RA). All participants will be reassessed at 16 and 52 weeks in person by an RA masked to treatment condition. The primary endpoint is the ability to complete ADLs and IADLs without difficulty at 16 weeks post-randomization. Other endpoints include lower extremity mobility, health-related quality of life, and home safety at 16 weeks and ADL and IADL limitations at 52 weeks post-randomization. We will examine moderators of treatment success and mediating mechanisms. We will also evaluate cost-effectiveness based on the cost of the intervention and health care utilization. The study is designed to detect clinically meaningful improvement in ADL or IADL limitations between the intervention and control group with 80 percent power (alpha = 0.05) in an intention to treat analysis. The innovative study will provide economic evidence for a theory-driven intervention that could rein in costs of a growing and increasingly diverse older adult population.          Disability in older adults is a major public health problem, particularly among low-income, urban people of color. Most adults with disabilities strongly prefer to live at home, but many have difficulty taking care of themselves. This study proposes to test the efficacy of a newly developed bio- behavioral-environmental intervention, Community Aging in Place - Advancing Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE), which combines evidence-based nursing, occupational therapy, and handyman components to help low income older adults function at home and save our nation costly nursing home care.

"Integrative Pathways to Health and Illness: Testing Older Cohort Hypotheses     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a competitive revision of POI AGO20166-07A2, ""Integrative Pathways to Health and Illness.""  We seek funds to add 1,400 older respondents (aged 55-74) to the ongoing ""Refresher"" data collection for the MIDUS (Midlife in the U.S.) national study. Reviewers of our competitive renewal for the POI (2011-2016) strongly encouraged this submission. The expanded Refresher sample will parallel the size and age distribution of the MIDUS I sample, thus affording two rich datasets for investigating pathways to health, with baselines situated on either side of historic economic change occurring in the U.S. Newly recruited older adults will complete a phone interview, two questionnaires, and a telephone-based cognitive battery. In addition, randomly selected subsamples will participate in 8-day diary assessments (n = 400), accompanied by 4 days of salivary assessments (Cortisol, DHEA-S, alpha amylase) 4 times a day as well as a 2-day clinic visit for comprehensive biomarker assessments (n = 200), including a laboratory challenge protocol accompanied by on-line physiological measures. Aim 1 is focused on age effects of the economic recession.  We predict that younger Refresher respondents will exhibit greater vulnerability in income and wealth, whereas older adults will show vulnerability in retirement savings and difficulty finding new work following lay-off. Health concomitants of economic hardship are also predicted to vary by age. Aim 2 is focused on period effects of the economic recession. Due to greater exposure, we predict that the post-recession Refresher sample will exhibit more compromised mental and physical health compared to the pre-recession MIDUS baseline sample (with respondents matched on age). Although aging brings increased risk for physical health problem, we predict that such effects will be most evident among the post-recession Refresher sample, particularly those with pre-existing vulnerability (low educational status). Aim 3 is focused on psychosocial moderating effects of life course (aging) and socioeconomic (social inequalities) effects on health. Using combined Refresher and MIDUS samples, we hypothesize that adverse health effects of economic hardship will be amplified among those with higher levels of vulnerability moderators (work-family conflict, job stress, neuroticism). Alternatively, among those with high protective moderators (well-being, sense of control, cognitive abilities, mental cohesion, and social support) adverse health will not be evident. The expanded MIDUS Refresher will lay the foundation for future tracking how economic hardship is changing the life course of different cohorts of American adults.                 ",Integrative Pathways to Health and Illness: Testing Older Cohort Hypotheses,8415040,P01AG020166,"['Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' neuroticism ', ' neurotic ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' Neuroses ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Economic Recession ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' diaries ', ' Side ', ' Salivary ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' social inequality ', ' Sampling ', ' Cognitive ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' aged ', ' cognitive control ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Age Distribution ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' glycogenase ', ' alpha-1,4-D-Glucanglucanohydrolase ', ' 1,4-alpha-D-Glucan glucanohydrolase ', ' alpha-amylase ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Data Collection ', ' Therapeutic Dehydroepiandrosterone ', ' Prasterone ', ' Dehydroisoandrosterone ', ' DHEA ', ' Androstenolone ', ' Androst-5-en-17-one, 3-hydroxy-, (3beta)- ', ' 5-Androsten-3-beta-hydroxy-17-one ', ' 3beta-Hydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one ', ' dehydroepiandrosterone ', ' Economics ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,P01,2013,617048,0.02475380520068017
"Filial Piety and Psychosocial Well-being in Chinese Population This application is a re-submission of our prior application (R01 MD006173) to examine the relationship between adult children 's filial piety and psychosocial wellbeing of Chinese older adults. Despite the rapid growth of Chinese populations, we have the most rudimentary understanding of many important issues facing the US Chinese older adults. More specifically, there are significant disparities in psychosocial wellbeing among Chinese older adults, who have the highest suicide rate than any other racial/ethnic group in the US. This marked health disparity is further exacerbated by the linguistic and cultural complexities when studying these issues as well as the inadequate community support necessary to empower the Chinese community to be fully engaged as equal partners in research. These impediments necessitate a deeper understanding broader contextual cultural factors associated with psychosocial distress, through the development of sustainable community-academic partnership and the reciprocal transfer of expertise to improve the health of the Chinese population.    Accordingly, we will leverage a comprehensive model of community-based participatory research (CBPR) to examine the relationship between important cultural factors and psychosocial wellbeing of Chinese older adults. Among many important cultural factors , filial piety is the most important and defines relationships between adult children and their parents. Improved understanding of filial piety could improve our understanding of a key contextual factor that may affect psychosocial wellbeing of Chinese older adults. The primary specific aims are to: 1) examine the relationship between adult children 's filial piety with older adult's psychosocial wellbeing; 2) examine the relationship between the discrepancies in adult children 's filial behaviors and older adult's filial expectations with the psychosocial wellbeing of older adults; and 3) examine the degree to which adult children 's filial piety influences other risk factors associated with psychological distress and social isolation of older adults. The secondary specific aims are to: 4) explore the influence of other relevant cultural factors on above relationship (aims 1-3); and 5) identify through semi-structure interviews the stress, barriers, challenges and cultural variations in the adherence and expectation of filial piety in both adult children and older adults. To achieve these objectives, a bilingual and bicultural principal investigator and an experienced interdisciplinary team will build on our NIH funded CBPR projects to collaborate with Chicago Chinese community groups. The findings from this proposal could inform the successful conduct of future prevention and intervention studies to improve psychosocial wellbeing in US Chinese older adults. Public Health Relevance:  This application aims to examine the relationship between adult children's filial piety and psychological and social wellbeing of Chinese older adults in a community-dwelling population. The findings from this study will provide important information on the risk and protective factors associated with psychosocial wellbeing of older Chinese persons.

"Epidemiology of Suicidal Behavior in Racially/Ethnically Diverse Older Americans  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This application is in response to RFA-MD-12-001: NIMHD Health Disparities Research. One of the priority areas of this RFA is the study of health conditions associated with significant mortality that have been understudied in health disparity populations. In older Americans, suicide rates are 30% higher than in the general population, and five times higher in non-Hispanic white men age 85 years or older-as the nation continues to grow and racially/ethnically diversify with age so will the rates of suicide. Yet, little is known about suicide-related behaviors (i.e., ideation, plans, and attempts) in older adults, which are strong risk factors for actual suicide and strong indicators of extreme emotional and mental distress. Even more so, differences in suicidal behavior by race/ethnicity have hardly been investigated at all, as most studies are from non-diverse clinic samples. Moreover, most of what we know about mental health services use related to suicide risk in older Americans comes from small non-diverse samples of suicide completers. However, understanding mental health services use and racial disparities in use is important, as all aging adults with emotional and mental distress related to suicidal thoughts and behaviors may benefit from service use and treatment. The proposed project will investigate the prevalence and predictors of suicidal ideation and related behaviors over the lifetime of older racially and ethnically diverse adults, that is, capturing transitions from ideation to plans and attempts and examining risk of late life and current suicidal behavior. It will also investigate mental health services use in those at increased risk of suicide. The aims will be addressed by studying three nationally representative aggregated data sets: 1) the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), a probability sample of the general U.S.; 2) the National Survey of American Life (NSAL), a probability sample of African- American, Afro-Caribbean, and non-Hispanic White Americans; and 3) the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), a probability sample of Latinos and Asian Americans. The project proposes to make innovative use of the combined data and examine a large, nationally-based cohort of over 3,600 respondents aged 55 and older. In a very cost-efficient approach, this project will be the first comprehensive examination of the prevalence and predictors of suicide-related behaviors and mental health services use in older Americans. Key predictors, including sociodemographic variables, psychiatric disorders, and chronic medical conditions associated with suicidal behavior will be determined (Aims 1 and 2)-assessing differences of associations overall and by race/ethnicity, that is, in older non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. In addition, racial disparities will be assessed separately for men and women (Aim 3), and key predictors of mental health services use will be examined overall and by race/ethnicity (Aim 4). Information stemming from this project will be important for identifying those older adults most at risk of suicide and with great need of care-helping to define national priorities for suicide prevention in late life for all Americans.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicidal risk profoundly impacts individuals, families, and society. Knowledge gained from this proposal will be both novel and critical for understanding the occurrence and predictors of suicide-related behaviors (i.e., ideation, planning, and attempts) in older Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White Americans, including use of mental health services in those at increased risk of suicide. Thus, this proposed project will have unique public health importance, because it will provide evidence for future psychiatric research and policy planning that will help to define national priorities for suicide prevention in late life for all Americans.",Epidemiology of Suicidal Behavior in Racially/Ethnically Diverse Older Americans,8448612,R01MD007019,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Anxiety ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Moods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Societies ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Respondent ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' stem ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2013,277134,0.04885192397603233
"TRANSLATION RESEARCH ON CHRONIC DISEASE SELF-MANAGEMENT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal application (Years 06-10) for the Indiana University Edward R. Roybal Center. The lU-Roybal facilitates research on improving support and education for self-management among vulnerable older adults cared for by generalist physicians. This thematic focus stems from our broad experience in designing and studying models of care for physically and socioeconomically vulnerable older adults. Our research recognizes the fundamental role of generalist physicians in providing care to older adults and the fundamental role of patient self-management in achieving excellent outcomes. In the first four years of the lU-Roybal, we supported 17 pilot projects that span cognitive, emotional, and physical domains of health as well as basic and applied research. Three Year 05 projects are now underway. Our pilots have largely operated in a laboratory of Community Health Centers (CHCs), which are part of an expanding national network of publicly-funded primary care sites serving persons regardless of ability to pay. The laboratory facilitates access to end-users (providers and patients and their families) who identify priorities and improve the translational potential of our interventions. Our 17 pilot projects have led to 11 externally funded grants and four pending grants. Translation to clinical pracitce outcomes to date include a cognitive care clinic, a lifestyle self-management program operating in seven CHCs, and a model academic-community research partnership to facilitate translation to clinical practice in an urban public health system. This competing renewal builds on our considerable strengths from the first five years of operations and proposes innovative new pilots and an expansion of our translational science laboratory. The pilots proposed represent use-inspired research that will asses a multi-modal self-management program to prevent or postpone cognitive decline, a study of the social factors that may prevent planned transitions out of nursing homes, decision support to facilitate patient-provider decision-making for complex preventive health services, and expansion of a two-way, interactive group video-conferencing project to promote physical activity among older adults. Each of these pilots addresses lessons learned and new opportunities identified in our first five years of funding. The four proposed pilots, as well as the 20 previous pilots, represent examples of the types of research projects that we will pursue in Years 6-10 of the lU-Roybal and represent the strengths of our real-world clinical laboratory.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Primary care is the site of care where most older adults receive their health care. Older adults often suffer from multiple chronic medical conditions and socioeconomic stressors. The Chronic Care Model identifies self-management as a core tenet in improving patient outcomes. Because there is a paucity of research on supporting patient self-management, we focus the lU-Roybal Center resources on this important topic.",TRANSLATION RESEARCH ON CHRONIC DISEASE

"Built Environment and Health Care Use: Disparities Among Chronically Ill Elders  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Associations between characteristics of the neighborhoods in which older people live and late-life disparities in chronic illness have been the subject of a rapidly growing field of research. For low-income and minority elders with chronic illness, disparities in access to and quality of care contribute to disparities in the burden of illness. Research on chronic illness has also underscored the links between inadequate physician oversight, potentially preventable hospitalizations, and poor health outcomes. However, little is known about the ways in which neighborhood environmental factors - beyond local supply of medical services - inform how urban older adults with chronic illness use physician services to manage their health. This study addresses this gap by examining the relationships between neighborhood built environment (e.g. walk-ability, access to public transit), use of physician services, and preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits among elderly, chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries who live in New York City. Specifically, the study aims to:  1) Examine associations between neighborhood built environment and physician service use among  urban, chronically ill older adults;  2) Determine whether and to what extent variations in the built environment influence potentially  preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits; and  3) Reassess findings from Aims 1 and 2 by applying: (i) alternative modeling techniques; and (ii) tests of  endogeneity to address the potential sorting of patients into neighborhoods with different characteristics  based on service use and outcomes.  The study will be based on longitudinal analysis of existing data on a sample of NYC-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older, linking individual characteristics and service use measures with small area- level data from other sources. Analyses will focus on patients with congestive heart failure and diabetes - two major contributors to preventable hospitalizations. This study will provide insight into the interdependence of clinical, social, economic, and environmental factors that influence quality of chronic illness care and, ultimately, quality of life, for older adults with multiple co-morbidities. The proposed research will apply and expand on the candidate's training throughout the K01 award period, including advanced methodological training in epidemiology and health economics. The training and research activities will lay the foundation for an R01 application in the later years of the award. Findings from this study and future research will ultimately be applied toward developing effective interventions to improve access to, continuity, and quality of ambulatory care for chronically ill elders living in underserved communities and, in turn, mitigate late-life health disparities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant socio-economic and racial/ethnic disparities exist in the burden of chronic illness among older adults, due partly to disparities in access to and quality of ambulatory care aimed at preventing chronic illness complications. Although prior research has examined geographic variations in health care access across areas such as counties, little is known about how variations in environmental and socio-economic factors at the neighborhood level influence disparities in service use and outcomes among vulnerable groups, particularly low-income and minority elders. This study aims to address this gap by examining the relationships between neighborhood built environment, use of physician services, and preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits among elderly, chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries who live in New York City.",Built Environment and Health Care Use: Disparities Among Chronically Ill Elders,8530136,K01AG039463,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Award ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Catchment Area (Health) ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' Transportation ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' Services ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' social ', ' medical supply ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' beneficiary ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' demographics ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' effective intervention ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' ']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,K01,2013,125552,0.00400776226366246
"Increasing Access to Hospice Care for Older African Americans:  A National Study     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Disparities in healthcare access and quality are well-documented for African Americans and include not only disease prevention, early detection, and appropriate treatment but also end-of-life care. Compared to Whites, African Americans are more likely to experience poor quality care at the end of life, including inadequate pain management and poor provider communication, and to report lower overall satisfaction with the quality of end-of-life care. Also, older African Americans with advanced illness are less likely than Whites to enroll in hospice which is currently the most comprehensive model for the care of patients at the end-of-life. Hospice enrollment is associated with both improvements in multiple domains of care, including symptom management and provider communication, and reduced disparities between Whites and African Americans in the quality of end-of-life care. Therefore, increasing the use of hospice care by older African Americans may result in a greater likelihood of high quality, patient-centered end-of-life care for this vulnerable population.  Like other healh disparities research, much of the literature on racial disparities in hospice use has focused on documenting the problem rather than seeking solutions. There is little empiric research identifying modifiable factors which may influence the use of hospice of care. Preliminary work suggests that hospice providers may be one target for interventions to increase access to hospice for older African Americans. This idea is supported by significant variability in the practices and policies of individual hospice providers beyond requirements for Medicare certification and the large variability across hospice service areas in the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries who enroll in hospice. This variability is even greater among African Americans and is not explained by decedent demographics or healthcare market factors. Additionally, although health care organizational culture is increasing being recognized as an important determinant of health disparities, much of the literature on organizational factors associated with the use of hospice by African Americans includes expert opinion of strategies that should work (i.e. community-based partnerships), but there have been no well- controlled analyses attempting to determine which of these strategies work best under which circumstances.  The overall goal of this project is to identify modifiable practices of hospice providers that are associated with greater use of hospice care by older African Americans in their service area. Using a survey and qualitative interview of a national sample of hospice providers, the study's specific aims will examine the association between the admission policies, community outreach practices, and other organizational characteristics, such as staff diversity, goals and strategic planning of hospice providers and service to older African Americans in their service area. Understanding which organizational practices are associated with greater use of hospice by African Americans will inform the development of interventions to increase access to hospice care and improve the quality of end-of-life care.           Despite higher mortality rates from a number of chronic illnesses and lower quality end-of-life care, African Americans use hospice services at lower rates that Whites. Hospice use is associated with improvements in the quality of end-of-life care. This research will identify the practices of hospice providers (i.e. community partnerships) which are associated with greater use of hospice care by older African Americans in their service area.

"Dietary protein and change in physical function in black and white older adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of older adults is expected to double by 2030. With the growth of the older population comes a parallel expectation of growth in the burden of age-related declines in physical function. Observational data show wide variations in the functional capabilities of older adults and have identified several potentially modifiable factors that influence the risk of functional decline. While the role of nutrition is well-establised in delaying or preventing chronic disease, because of the lack of large prospective studies of nutrition and diet in older adults, less is known about the role of nutrition in the maintenance of physical function. Nonetheless, increasing evidence suggests that nutritional factors are important to the maintenance of physical function.  Loss of lean mass with aging, and the associated declines in strength, are well documented and partially account for aging-related loss of physical function. Inadequate dietary protein has been suggested as a factor that may contribute to the declines in lean mass, strength, and physical function that occurs with age. National data suggest that a significant proportion of older adults consume inadequate protein. Furthermore, current dietary protein requirements are based predominately on short-term nitrogen balance studies in young adults and may underestimate the intakes needed to optimally preserve lean mass, strength, or physical function in older adults. We propose to examine the association between dietary protein intake and change in strength  and both objectively and subjectively measured physical function over 6 years of follow-up using data from the  Health ABC study, a prospective cohort of 3,075 black and white men and women in their seventies who have  been followed annually since 1997-98. The following specific aims will be addressed: 1) to determine whether dietary protein intake predicts change in strength and physical performance~ and 2) to determine whether dietary protein intake predicts incident mobility limitation. We hypothesize that participants with higher intakes of protein will have smaller declines in strength and physical performance and a decreased risk of incident mobility limitation over 6 years of follow-up compared to those with lower intakes of protein. In exploratory  analyses, we will also examine the association between protein source (e.g., animal vs. vegetable) and  essential amino acid intake (particularly branched chain amino acids such as leonine) and change in physical  function~ whether the associations between dietary protein intake and physical function are mediated through  changes in lean mass~ whether the associations between protein and physical function are modified by other  risk factors (e.g., physical inactivity, obesity, weight loss, inflammation, and insulin resistance)~ and whether the  associations between dietary protein intake and physical function differ by race or help explain racial disparities  in physical function. The proposed analyses will determine the role of dietary protein in the maintenance of physical function in older adults and inform dietary recommendations regarding the level of optimal protein intake for the maintenance of physical function in an aging population.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With the growth of the older population comes a parallel expectation of growth in the burden of age-related declines in physical function. Loss of lean body mass with aging, and the associated declines in strength, are well documented and partially account for aging-related loss of physical function. Inadequate dietary protein has been suggested as a factor that may contribute to the declines in lean body mass, strength, and physical function that occurs with age. Thus, determining the optimal protein intake for the preservation of physical function in an aging population is of significant public health importance.               ",Dietary protein and change in physical function in black and white older adults,8570135,R03AG045492,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' branched chain aminoacid ', ' Branched-Chain Amino Acids ', ' essential aminoacid ', ' Essential Amino Acids ', ' Animals ', ' Body Composition ', ' Body Weight ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Dietary Proteins ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Food ', ' Gait ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Inflammation ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Interviewer ', ' Knee ', ' L-Leucine ', ' L-Isomer Leucine ', ' Leucine ', ' Maintenance ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' preservation ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Time ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Vegetables ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Woman ', ' frail older adult ', ' Frail Seniors ', ' Frail Elders ', ' Frail Elderly ', ' Frail Older Adults ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Measurement ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Knowledge ', ' nitrogen balance ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Source ', ' protein intake ', ' Physical Function ', ' Recommended Dietary Allowance ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Diet and Nutrition ', ' Intake ', ' Older Population ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Nutrition Research ', ' Nutritional Study ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' protein function ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' decline in function ', ' functional decline ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' prospective ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2013,76500,0.042575976098069145
"Effects of Employment on Health and Quality of Life in Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People over 65 years old (65+) are the fastest growing group in the US population, and workers 65+ are increasing in number much more rapidly than any other worker age group. By year 2012, workers 65+ are estimated to comprise 16.7% of US labor force. This group of elderly workers is highly diverse (e.g. racial/ethnic and socio-economic status composition), yet their health status is only beginning to be characterized. Furthermore, careful examination of health-related quality of life of the older worker has been virtually ignored by the occupational health/aging research community. Finally, there has been no systematic research into variations in healthcare costs and utilization in this population, despite systemic concern over rising healthcare costs in the United States. This study proposes to use the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to study the health status, medical expenditures, healthcare utilization, and quality of life of employed older adults. Both datasets contain large representative samples of US adults 65+ (n=386,887 and n=17,396). Both descriptive and analytic modeling are proposed within a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework, taking into account socio-economic determinants of health such as occupational segregation and occupational prestige. The study proposes to:1) characterize health disparities, morbidity, health behaviors and conditions, and health-related quality of life of US workers and non-workers 65+ stratified by age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, health insurance, occupational segregation and prestige, employment status and occupational/industry categories; 2) using SEM, identify sociodemographic and occupational factors (including occupational prestige and segregation) associated with healthcare utilization and expenditures by workers 65+ after adjustment for health behavior, morbidity and health conditions; and 3) using SEM, predict the health- related quality of life in sub-populations of workers 65+ after adjustment for health behavior, morbidity and health conditions. This study is relevant to four out of five National Institute on Aging (NIA) research goals, including: (1) understanding of disease and disability in older adults; (2) aiding in developing interventions to improve their health and quality of life; (3) understanding the implications of an aging society; and (4) identification of health disparities and interventions to decrease these disparities. The findings of the proposed study can be used by policy makers, employers, and other stakeholders to make health-related and employment-related decisions and implement workplace changes and health promotion programs targeting the senior community in order to improve well-being and quality of life of people 65+.        Adults over 65 years old who remain employed past retirement age constitute a rapidly growing and a highly diverse proportion of US older adults, however their health status, healthcare expenditures, and quality of life are only beginning to be characterized. Using innovative advanced statistical techniques this proposal will describe current older worker socio-demographics characteristics, health status, as well as study linkages between occupational status and occupation on one hand, and health status, healthcare utilization and expenditures, and health-related quality of life on the other.

"Mechanisms of health disparities in parkinsonism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for an NIA Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development (K23) award seeks support to develop a program of research related to understanding the mechanisms of health disparities in Parkinsonism. As part of the education plan, the PI proposes to: 1) Increase her understanding of health behavior theory, geriatrics and health disparities; 2) Gain additional epidemiological skills in study design and health measurement; and 3) Acquire the analytic skills associated with psychometric and longitudinal data analysis. Along with these educational goals, there is an associated research project.  The principal research objective of this project is to understand the patient-level factors related to healthcare disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinsonian signs. Specifically, this study proposes to evaluate how older adults' aging beliefs affect the recognition of Parkinsonian signs, and how race, culture and socioeconomic status impact this relationship. To achieve these goals, there are three specific aims: 1) To validate a screening instrument for Parkinsonian signs by comparing it with neurological examination; 2) To examine older adults' beliefs regarding movement changes and their association with Parkinsonian signs and relevant patient-level characteristics; and 3) To determine the association between beliefs about aging, subsequent comorbidities, including falls and fractures, and the detection and treatment of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. After validation of a screening instrument for Parkinsonian signs, this measure will be incorporated into a cross-sectional and prospective evaluation of the relationship between aging beliefs and Parkinsonian signs, particularly as it is modified by socioeconomic factors. Subjects will be recruited and surveyed in primary care clinics and outcomes will be determined through the electronic health record. Successful completion of this project will lead to the development of educational interventions targeting improved understanding of aging related functional decline among older adults. This application will provide critical support for the PI to become an independent researcher and a leader in health services research in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aging-related movement problems are common in older adults and lead to increased disability and death. Underserved minorities may be particularly vulnerable to under-recognition and treatment of these movement problems. This research aims to understand why patients may not get appropriate and timely therapy in order to develop public health strategies to improve care for older adults.

"Health IT decision support to improve medication management safety and quality     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For older adults, polypharmacy is a major safety issue with serious economic implications. Dr. Gerardo Moreno proposes research needed to investigate the use of health information technology (HIT) to improve medication management decision making for older adults in community health centers. The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award will provide Dr. Moreno, a family medicine physician from UCLA, the resources to focus his research on aging and to obtain additional research training needed to become an independent principal investigator. The detailed research and career development experiences proposed aim to build upon his existing research skill set to gain needed expertise to: 1) develop his independence as a productive principal investigator in the area of Latino aging health disparities; 2) further focus his research and gain significant expertise in aging-related issues; and 3) expand his qualitative research skills and implementation science skills. To achieve these goals, Dr. Moreno will complete course work, directed reading tutorials, and practical research experience. The career development activities also include mentorship and resources from the UCLA Resource Center for Minority Aging Research, a program devoted to eliminating disparities in health and health care among minority elders and to developing minority faculty who will be independently funded investigators who conduct aging research. Dr. Moreno's multidisciplinary mentorship team includes a health services researcher, social scientist, health informatics researcher, statistician with formal computer science training, and geriatrician. This proposal will use principles of community-based participatory research to build upon an established 4 year academic-community research partnership developed by the applicant with a large rural community health center.            For older adults with multiple chronic conditions, polypharmacy can lead to increased use of potentially inappropriate medications and at the same time to the underutilization of medications known to improve health outcomes. Health (IT) tools may improve decision making for medication management but we know little about their application in community health centers and other safety-net settings. An overall objective of this proposal is to enhance Dr. Moreno's research skills and to conduct preliminary studies needed to develop health IT point-of-care (POC) decision support tailored to the prescription drug management needs of older adults in a safety-net system. Health IT POC clinical decision support in community health centers can be adopted by clinicians and hold great promise for improving the safety and quality of medication management for older adults when the end users of the system are incorporated into the research process from start to finish. Therefore, Dr. Moreno proposes research in partnership with a large rural community/migrant health center in California's impoverished San Joaquin Valley that serves two counties and has 22 clinical sites. His community partner's patient population is 72 percent Latino which is significant given the current and projected increase of elderly Latinos over the next few decades. To this end, the specific aims that focus on adults ¿ 60 years of age are: 1) to examine the prevalence and correlates of use of potentially inappropriate medications, 2) to examine how often there is suboptimal medication intensification of needed treatments for those with hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemias, 3) to identify provider, patient, and stakeholder barriers and facilitators (e.g. work flow issues and tailoring of message) to adoption of patient-centered health IT POC decision support designed to improve prescription drug management and safety, and 4) to adapt and develop a prototype of health IT POC decision support system for prescription drug management tailored to older adults with cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemias. Aims 1-3 will inform the development and the decision support content and targeted messaging that is proposed in Aim 4. This research forms the basis for an R01 application of an adequately powered randomized clinical trial of health IT POC decision support to improve medication management quality and safety for older adults across a regional community clinic network.           Older adults are at increased risk of using potentially inappropriate medications and paradoxically of under using treatments known to improve control of cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure. Health information technology (HIT) decision support to improve medication management delivered electronically during the patient visit holds great potential for decreasing use of potentially inappropriate medications and increasing the use of beneficial treatments. This project is grounded in an established community-based approach that will systematically include feedback from physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and patients so that the medication decision support tools developed are widely accepted and address the most important barriers for safe prescribing for older adults with chronic conditions.

"Maximizing the Impact of ePHIM in Low-Income, Multiethnic Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to access, manage, and understand personal health information enables individuals to become  better consumers and participate more fully in making health care decisions.  The development of electronic health records and the availability of patient portals for accessing personal health records, coupled with myriad health information via the internet (eHealth), have provided the potential for electronic personal health information management (ePHIM).  However, great variability exists in access to eHealth information for components of the US population. Despite continuing efforts, this ""digital divide"" remains for rural, minority and low-income communities.  Limited access for ePHIM contributes to the health disparities experienced by these populations.  The goal of this project is to improve the ability of low-income African American, American Indian, Latino, and white older adults living in rural and urban communities to use information technology applications for ePHIM.  The project's conceptual framework combines the Technology Acceptance Model and the person- environmental interaction model.  It uses a community-based participatory partnership of Wake Forest School  of Medicine and its Outpatient Department Medicine Clinic, with Community Partners HealthNet, a network of  18 clinics serving 25 rural North Carolina counties, to achieve 3 specific aims:  (1) document the ePHIM  experience, knowledge, perceived needs, and perceived risks of low-income African American, American  Indian, Latino, and white older adults living in rural and urban communities~ (2) delineate the actual use of  ePHIM by low-income African American, American Indian, Latino, and white older adults living in rural and  urban communities~ and (3) delineate differences in perception, belief and experience in using ePHIM between  patients and caregivers who use versus those who do not use ePHIM.  This project is significant because it will delineate disparities in ePHIM by working with two networks of clinics (Community Partners HealthNet~ Outpatient Department Medicine Clinic/Wake Forest Baptist Health) that provides care to rural and urban, low- income, and minority patients.  Working with these networks, this project will implement in-depth and longitudinal research that will delineate the factors affecting ePHIM use among vulnerable elders.  This project is innovative.  (1)  It will use qualitative data collection techniques within a community-based participatory research framework to assess the motives and barriers to patients' and caregivers' ePHIM among rural as well as urban, low-income, older adult, and minority communities.  (2) It emphasizes the importance of including caregivers, particularly for older adults, in understanding the use of ePHIM.   (3) It will use these qualitative methods to assess the perceptions of health care providers and IT providers about the potential use of ePHIM.   (4) It will use these qualitative methods to determine the factors that facilitated and limited the use of ePHIM by comparing high / expert, medium, and low users.  (5) It will document the actual pattern of ePHIM use among older adults and their caregivers over a one-year period.  (6) It will explore the association of ePHIM use and chronic disease management among older adults.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to access, manage and understand personal health information enables individuals to become better consumers and to participate more fully in making health care decisions.

"Psychological Well Being and Recovery Among Older Hospitalized Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposed study addresses the Program Announcement entitled ""Research on Mind-Body Interactions and Health"" (PA-07-046). Specifically, we address the National Institute on Aging (NIA) interest in exploring associations between psychological well-being and functional ability in older adults hospitalized for acute illness. The Specific Aims of the proposed application are to: 1. Examine change in functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. Functional status will be assessed by a battery of measures (a 4 meter walk, a test of grip strength, knee extensor strength and seven activities of daily living (ADLs)) at 5 time points: within 24 hours of hospital admission and discharge, and 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge. 2. Examine direct and indirect associations between psychological well-being and functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. Psychological well-being, assessed by a 6- domain psychological well-being instrument and a positive affect summary scale, will be used to examine patterns of association with functional status over the 5 time points outlined in aim 1. 3. Examine whether psychological well-being modifies ethnic health disparities associated with functional status during hospitalization and up to one-year post hospital discharge. This aim will allow us to examine how ethnic group (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics) interacts with psychological well-being to influence functional status over the 5 time points outlined in aim 1. To explore our aims, we plan to follow up an ethnically diverse sample of 800 older patients (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics) admitted to the Acute Care for Elders (ACE) unit at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Older adults enrolled in the study will be assessed at five time points: within 24 hours of hospital admission, within 24 hours of hospital discharge and 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge. The five time points will allow us not only to examine overall patterns of effect between functional status and psychological well-being but it will also allow us to examine patterns of effect over distinct time periods including hospitalization and post discharge. The three post discharge follow up interviews will further allow us to examine and explain associations between functional status and psychological well-being in relation to short (1 month) and longer term (6 and 12 month) recovery patterns. A central goal of the current application is to examine whether psychological well-being can influence the risk for functional status decline associated with hospitalization in an ethnically diverse older patient population.

"Effects of Employment on Health and Quality of Life in Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People over 65 years old (65+) are the fastest growing group in the US population, and workers 65+ are increasing in number much more rapidly than any other worker age group. By year 2012, workers 65+ are estimated to comprise 16.7% of US labor force. This group of elderly workers is highly diverse (e.g. racial/ethnic and socio-economic status composition), yet their health status is only beginning to be characterized. Furthermore, careful examination of health-related quality of life of the older worker has been virtually ignored by the occupational health/aging research community. Finally, there has been no systematic research into variations in healthcare costs and utilization in this population, despite systemic concern over rising healthcare costs in the United States. This study proposes to use the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to study the health status, medical expenditures, healthcare utilization, and quality of life of employed older adults. Both datasets contain large representative samples of US adults 65+ (n=386,887 and n=17,396). Both descriptive and analytic modeling are proposed within a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework, taking into account socio-economic determinants of health such as occupational segregation and occupational prestige. The study proposes to:1) characterize health disparities, morbidity, health behaviors and conditions, and health-related quality of life of US workers and non-workers 65+ stratified by age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, health insurance, occupational segregation and prestige, employment status and occupational/industry categories; 2) using SEM, identify sociodemographic and occupational factors (including occupational prestige and segregation) associated with healthcare utilization and expenditures by workers 65+ after adjustment for health behavior, morbidity and health conditions; and 3) using SEM, predict the health- related quality of life in sub-populations of workers 65+ after adjustment for health behavior, morbidity and health conditions. This study is relevant to four out of five National Institute on Aging (NIA) research goals, including: (1) understanding of disease and disability in older adults; (2) aiding in developing interventions to improve their health and quality of life; (3) understanding the implications of an aging society; and (4) identification of health disparities and interventions to decrease these disparities. The findings of the proposed study can be used by policy makers, employers, and other stakeholders to make health-related and employment-related decisions and implement workplace changes and health promotion programs targeting the senior community in order to improve well-being and quality of life of people 65+.        Adults over 65 years old who remain employed past retirement age constitute a rapidly growing and a highly diverse proportion of US older adults, however their health status, healthcare expenditures, and quality of life are only beginning to be characterized. Using innovative advanced statistical techniques this proposal will describe current older worker socio-demographics characteristics, health status, as well as study linkages between occupational status and occupation on one hand, and health status, healthcare utilization and expenditures, and health-related quality of life on the other.

Within this theme, an important focus of the UCLA OAIC is on understanding the role of inflammation in disease and disability.    To accomplish its goals, the UCLA OAIC has established 4 Research Cores (Recruitment and Retention, Research Operations, Analysis and Cost Effectiveness, and Inflammatory Biology) and a new Information Dissemination Core that will facilitate OAlC-related research at every step (recruitment, measurement, data management, analysis, interpretation, and adoption of findings). Research cores provide support at 4 levels:   Consultation (e.g., providing up to several hours of advice, reading a paper or a proposal)   Partnership on new proposals   Short-term (e.g., up to 2-3 days of consultation, performing assays)   Ongoing or long-term support (e.g., ongoing, part of the project team)  In addition, the UCLA OAIC Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core and Research Career Development Core stimulate new research via a pipeline of junior investigators and pilot awards and recruit successful investigators into OAlC-related research. The Leadership/Administrative Core ensures that these specific activities are accomplished and the goals of the UCLA OAIC are optimally achieved.    The UCLA OAIC will address health disparities that vulnerable older persons face because of 1) inadequate understanding of contributors (e.g., socioeconomic status, inflammation) to health and specific illnesses (e.g., HIV, sleep, depression), 2) lack of effective preventive or therapeutc approaches (biomedical and behavioral), or 3) inadequate ability to get needed treatment to vulnerable older populations (e.g., cultural barriers, ineffective health care systems). By focusin efforts and resources through the OAIC, the timeline for research to develop, test, and disseminate promising innovations to maintain independence can be accelerated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the increasingly diverse sociodemographic profile of older Americans, including growing numbers of minorities and persons at risk because of chronic diseases, our understanding of the causes, prevention, and treatment of illness in these populations is particularly limited. To prevent the health disparities that persist into old age an increased risk for decline in these older vulnerable populations, research is needed on diseases and disorders, on what treatments work best for whom, and on how best to deliver health care.",UCLA Older Americans Independence Center,8842233,P30AG028748,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Anemia ', ' Award ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Decision Making ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Demography ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Inflammation ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Operations Research ', ' Paper ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Reading ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sleep ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' ranpirnase ', ' Generations ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Uninsured ', ' TimeLine ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Hour ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' data management ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' TIM1 ', ' P60 ', ' GEF5 ', ' ARHGEF5 ', ' ARHGEF5 gene ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Population Research ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Older Population ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' translational approach ', ' successful intervention ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P30,2014,143739,0.08128022696574043
"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose here our overall plan for the Health Promotion Research Center (HPRC) at the University of Washington for the next five years. One of the original three Prevention Research Centers funded by CDC in 1986, HPRC focuses on promoting healthy aging and reducing health disparities among adults aged 50 and older. Building on our 15 years of experience conducting dissemination and implementation research aimed at scale-up of effective interventions, we plan to focus our work in three areas: cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion.  Specifically, we will expand the national reach of three flagship healthy-aging programs that were developed and tested by HPRC and disseminated by community organizations partnering with HPRC. First is EnhanceFitness, a group-exercise program for older adults. Since 1999, Senior Services, a Seattle-based non- profit organization serving older adults, has disseminated EnhanceFitness to more than 500 community sites in more than 30 states. It has reached more than 25,000 older adults, most of whom are low-income or members of racial and ethnic minorities. Second is PEARLS, a depression-management program delivered in community settings. Since 2003, Area Agencies on Aging have delivered PEARLS to more than 2,000 low-income, largely fragile and home-bound older adults with depression, through 45 sites in 14 states. Third is Workplace Solutions, a package of evidence-based cancer prevention practices for the workplace. Since 2003, the American Cancer Society has disseminated Workplace Solutions to more than 1,600 workplaces with 6.9 million employees in 42 states.  Scale-up of the EnhanceFitness program, with a focus on reducing race/ethnicity-related disparities in arthritis suffering, will be the objective of our Core Researh Project. In 2011, Senior Services licensed EnhanceFitness to YMCA of the USA (Y-USA), the national-network office for more than 2,700 YMCAs. Because EnhanceFitness decreases pain and increases mobility for persons with arthritis, Y-USA will focus its EnhanceFitness implementation on the half of older adults who suffer from arthritis. Older adults are much more likely to participate in a community-based program like EnhanceFitness if it is recommended by a health care provider, so Y-USA has asked for HPRC's help in enhancing its current, limited approach to increasing provider recommendations for EnhanceFitness participation. To do so, we will first conduct formative research with pharmacists and physical therapists to learn the most effective means of increasing recommendations to a community-based program like EnhanceFitness. Second, we will develop an enhanced approach tailored to obtaining recommendations by pharmacists, physical therapists, and primary-care providers for participation of older-adult arthritis patients in EnhanceFitness at YMCAs. Third, we will conduct a cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness and the cost of the current and enhanced approaches.                  HPRC's three healthy-aging focus areas - cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion - address many of the biggest health problems among middle- aged and older adults. Our research is aimed at national expansion of HPRC's three evidence-based healthy- aging programs: EnhanceFitness, which increases physical activity and preserves functioning; PEARLS, which reduces depression; and Workplace Solutions/HealthLinks, which increases employers' use of evidence-based practices to prevent chronic illnesses. These programs all have a record of success in reaching underserved, diverse populations at disparate risk for chronic diseases and related disability and mortality.",Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center,8739032,U48DP005013,[''],NCCDPHP,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U48,2014,1935581,0.14100159479345614
"Dietary protein and change in physical function in black and white older adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of older adults is expected to double by 2030. With the growth of the older population comes a parallel expectation of growth in the burden of age-related declines in physical function. Observational data show wide variations in the functional capabilities of older adults and have identified several potentially modifiable factors that influence the risk of functional decline. While the role of nutrition is well-establised in delaying or preventing chronic disease, because of the lack of large prospective studies of nutrition and diet in older adults, less is known about the role of nutrition in the maintenance of physical function. Nonetheless, increasing evidence suggests that nutritional factors are important to the maintenance of physical function.  Loss of lean mass with aging, and the associated declines in strength, are well documented and partially account for aging-related loss of physical function. Inadequate dietary protein has been suggested as a factor that may contribute to the declines in lean mass, strength, and physical function that occurs with age. National data suggest that a significant proportion of older adults consume inadequate protein. Furthermore, current dietary protein requirements are based predominately on short-term nitrogen balance studies in young adults and may underestimate the intakes needed to optimally preserve lean mass, strength, or physical function in older adults. We propose to examine the association between dietary protein intake and change in strength  and both objectively and subjectively measured physical function over 6 years of follow-up using data from the  Health ABC study, a prospective cohort of 3,075 black and white men and women in their seventies who have  been followed annually since 1997-98. The following specific aims will be addressed: 1) to determine whether dietary protein intake predicts change in strength and physical performance~ and 2) to determine whether dietary protein intake predicts incident mobility limitation. We hypothesize that participants with higher intakes of protein will have smaller declines in strength and physical performance and a decreased risk of incident mobility limitation over 6 years of follow-up compared to those with lower intakes of protein. In exploratory  analyses, we will also examine the association between protein source (e.g., animal vs. vegetable) and  essential amino acid intake (particularly branched chain amino acids such as leonine) and change in physical  function~ whether the associations between dietary protein intake and physical function are mediated through  changes in lean mass~ whether the associations between protein and physical function are modified by other  risk factors (e.g., physical inactivity, obesity, weight loss, inflammation, and insulin resistance)~ and whether the  associations between dietary protein intake and physical function differ by race or help explain racial disparities  in physical function. The proposed analyses will determine the role of dietary protein in the maintenance of physical function in older adults and inform dietary recommendations regarding the level of optimal protein intake for the maintenance of physical function in an aging population.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With the growth of the older population comes a parallel expectation of growth in the burden of age-related declines in physical function. Loss of lean body mass with aging, and the associated declines in strength, are well documented and partially account for aging-related loss of physical function. Inadequate dietary protein has been suggested as a factor that may contribute to the declines in lean body mass, strength, and physical function that occurs with age. Thus, determining the optimal protein intake for the preservation of physical function in an aging population is of significant public health importance.",Dietary protein and change in physical function in black and white older adults,8707304,R03AG045492,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' branched chain aminoacid ', ' Branched-Chain Amino Acids ', ' essential aminoacid ', ' Essential Amino Acids ', ' Animals ', ' Body Composition ', ' Body Weight ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Dietary Proteins ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Food ', ' Gait ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Inflammation ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Interviewer ', ' Knee ', ' L-Leucine ', ' L-Isomer Leucine ', ' Leucine ', ' Maintenance ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' preservation ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Time ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Vegetables ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Woman ', ' frail older adult ', ' Frail Seniors ', ' Frail Elders ', ' Frail Elderly ', ' Frail Older Adults ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Measurement ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Knowledge ', ' nitrogen balance ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Source ', ' protein intake ', ' Physical Function ', ' Recommended Dietary Allowance ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Diet and Nutrition ', ' Intake ', ' Older Population ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Nutrition Research ', ' Nutritional Study ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' protein function ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' decline in function ', ' functional decline ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' prospective ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2014,76959,0.042575976098069145
"Community Choirs to Promote Healthy Aging and Independence of Older Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The United States is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults. In 2009, there were 39.6 million individuals over age 65, and this number is expected to almost double by 2030. During the same time period, there will be an increase in the number of older adults with diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds who are at increased risk for poor health outcomes relative to non-minority elders. Thus, there is an immediate need to identify cost-effective, widely applicable, and sustainable programs that promote health and well-being of older adults. A growing body of literature suggests that participation in community choral singing may also have positive health benefits for older adults, but there is a need to evaluate the efficacy of a choral program for diverse older adults, and a well-designed randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to help strengthen the evidence base. Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to test the efficacy of community choir program for maintaining health and well-being in culturally diverse older adults. To address the aims of the study, we will evaluate a comprehensive set of outcomes that are hypothesized to be related to choral singing and complete a cost analysis. We will recruit 450 diverse older adults and will utilize 12 existing Administration on Aging-supported senior centers to implement a multi-site, randomized (by center) clinical trial (RCT). Centers will be randomized to receive the choir program immediately (intervention group) or after a 6-month delayed intervention phase (control group). The community choirs will be led by professional music directors. We will assess both primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 months (and 18 months for the delayed intervention group). We will also evaluate the start- up and ongoing program costs for senior centers, including cost/person served and determine quality adjusted life years. If successful, results from this RCT may help develop and further the premise that creative arts can be applied to helping solve national health priorities, such as keeping older adults active, independent, and involved in their communities in readily accessible, affordable, and sustainable ways. The United States is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, a group that is at increased risk of poor health relative to non-minorities. There is an immediate need to identify cost-effective, widely applicable, and sustainable programs that promote health, wellbeing and independence and that are appropriate for our increasingly diverse population of older adults.",Community Choirs to Promote Healthy Aging and Independence of Older Adults,8915366,R01AG042526,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Arts ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Dancing ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Literature ', ' Loneliness ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Music ', ' Persons ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Walking ', ' falls ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Health Benefit ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' Shortness of Breath ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Physical Function ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' healthy aging ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2014,142500,0.18204613721340743
"Quality of Epilepsy Treatment and Costs in Older Americans by Race (QUIET CARE)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As of today, we have limited knowledge on the extent to which older Americans with epilepsy, especially typically disadvantaged minorities, receive antiepileptic drug treatment (AED) and follow-up care that is safe and effective. Epilepsy incidence peaks in older age as well as in childhood, and is higher in some minorities; e.g., it is 80% higher in African American (AA) compared to white Medicare beneficiaries. Appropriate treatment is crucial to optimize the chances of seizure control. Based on adult treatment effectiveness and safety data, the Quality Indicators for Epilepsy Treatment (QUIET) were developed in 2007 to assess quality of care. Previous literature suggests not all racial groups receive QUIET concordant care. In addition, poor AED adherence, also typically more common among minorities, limits seizure control. Improving care and adherence to AED treatment in all older adults with epilepsy has the potential to prevent avoidable seizures and also reduce medical costs. Our long-term goal is to inform and design interventions that improve the health care for older minorities with epilepsy and reduce health care costs associated with preventable events. The objective of this application is to examine the current quality of, and adherence to, AEDs and the current quality of care after recurrent seizures across racial groups of older Americans, and to identify opportunities for quality of care improvements and health care costs reductions as a first step toward the long term goal. The rationale for this research is that it is fundamental to inform the progression toward the national objective of living well with epilepsy and potentially reduce health care costs for the hundreds of thousands Medicare beneficiaries who suffer from this disorder. We plan to accomplish our objective by using Medicare administrative claims and a validated algorithm to identify epilepsy cases from these data, to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Assess quality of AED treatment across racial groups of Medicare beneficiaries with epilepsy. Our hypothesis is that, compared to white beneficiaries, typically disadvantaged minorities (e.g., AAs, Native Americans, Hispanics) are less likely to have QUIET concordant AED treatment and less likely to adhere to AEDs; 2) Determine the quality of care after seizure recurrence across race. We hypothesize that minority beneficiaries are less likely to have QUIET concordant care after recurrent seizures. Using the Behavioral Model of Access to Care, analyses for aims 1 and 2 will determine the contribution to racial disparities of, among others, current features of drug plans and geographic variation in care; and 3) determine if lower health care costs are associated with QUIET concordant care across racial groups. If H1-H3 are correct, we hypothesize that minority beneficiaries will be more likely to have high potentially preventable health care costs. This novel project will have a positive impact because it will provide much needed information to move the field toward improving epilepsy care, reducing disparities and potentially reducing costs for older adults.          The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding whether older adults across minority groups are receiving the care that maximizes the chances of seizure control and good quality of life is expected to inform interventions for providers and/or patients that will ultimately lead to living well with epilepsy, reduce disparities as well as reduce health care costs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders (NINDS)'s objective of assuring a life with ""no seizure, no side effects"" for all Americans with epilepsy. This is especially important as the US healthcare system deals with an ever increasing number of older adults with epilepsy.

"Suicide Prevention in Chinese Older Adults This two-site (Rush University and Northwestern University) linked re-submission of R34MH100443 collaborative application aims to design a culturally tailored and communityengaged intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts in US Chinese older adults, who have the highest suicide rate than any other racial/ethnic groups. Despite this health disparity, we have great paucity in our understanding of cultural issues surrounding suicide in Chinese populations, and this has directly hampered the intervention efforts. Accordingly, we seek to support a geriatrician (Dong) with expertise in aging, mental health and Chinese culture, and an interventionist (Simon) with expertise in clinical trials using community health workers to reduce health disparities among minority populations. More specifically, we aim to 1) expand synergistic academic and community partnerships; 2) iteratively design and refine a culturally meaningful pilot intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts; 3) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial; and 4) rigorously evaluate the cultural acceptability of the proposed intervention at multiple levels. This study will set the cornerstone for the next R01 application to fully test the efficacy of a culturally tailored intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts in Chinese aging populations.    By 2030, Chinese older adults will account for a quarter of the world's aging populations. Despite the rapid growth of Chinese populations in the US, there are marked health disparities among Chinese older adults, which are further exacerbated by the complex linguistic and cultural nuances in studying Chinese populations, particularly on issues of suicidal thoughts. Moreover, there has been inadequate and sustainable community support necessary to empower the Chinese community to be fully engaged as equal partners in research. In this application, a bilingual and bicultural principal investigator and an interdisciplinary investigative team have leveraged the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR), building on our prior NIH funded CBPR projects to partner synergistically and sustainably with the Chicago Chinese community in order to overcome these challenges and set the foundation for this proposal. The study findings will inform clinicians, investigators, communities, social services and policy makers to: a) improve our in-depth understanding of cultural issues surrounding suicide; b) empower community to be equal partners in mental health research ; c) guide the next R01 intervention study; and d) inform practice and policy on suicide care in Chinese older adults. Public Health Relevance:  This R34 resubmission will collaborative and iteratively design and refine a culturally adapted intervention to reduce the frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts in Chinese older adults.

"2/2 - Suicide Prevention in Chinese Older Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This two-site (Rush University and Northwestern University) linked re-submission of R34MH100443 collaborative application aims to design a culturally tailored and community- engaged intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts in US Chinese older adults, who have the highest suicide rate than any other racial/ethnic groups. Despite this health disparity, we have great paucity in our understanding of cultural issues surrounding suicide in Chinese populations, and this has directly hampered the intervention efforts. Accordingly, we seek to support a geriatrician (Dong) with expertise in aging, mental health and Chinese culture, and an interventionist (Simon) with expertise in clinical trials using community health workers to reduce health disparities among minority populations. More specifically, we aim to 1) expand synergistic academic and community partnerships; 2) iteratively design and refine a culturally meaningful pilot intervention to reduce suicidal thought; 3) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial; and 4) rigorously evaluate the cultural acceptability of the proposed intervention at multiple levels. This study will set the cornerstone for the next R01 application to fully test the efficacy of a culturally tailored intervention to reuce suicidal thoughts in Chinese aging populations.  By 2030, Chinese older adults will account for a quarter of the world's aging populations. Despite the rapid growth of Chinese populations in the US, there are marked health disparities among Chinese older adults, which are further exacerbated by the complex linguistic and cultural nuances in studying Chinese populations, particularly on issues of suicidal thoughts. Moreover, there has been inadequate and sustainable community support necessary to empower the Chinese community to be fully engaged as equal partners in research. In this application, a bilingual and bicultural principal investigator and an interdisciplinary investigative team have leveraged the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR), building on our prior NIH funded CBPR projects to partner synergistically and sustainably with the Chicago Chinese community in order to overcome these challenges and set the foundation for this proposal.

"Increasing Access to Hospice Care for Older African Americans:  A National Study     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Disparities in healthcare access and quality are well-documented for African Americans and include not only disease prevention, early detection, and appropriate treatment but also end-of-life care. Compared to Whites, African Americans are more likely to experience poor quality care at the end of life, including inadequate pain management and poor provider communication, and to report lower overall satisfaction with the quality of end-of-life care. Also, older African Americans with advanced illness are less likely than Whites to enroll in hospice which is currently the most comprehensive model for the care of patients at the end-of-life. Hospice enrollment is associated with both improvements in multiple domains of care, including symptom management and provider communication, and reduced disparities between Whites and African Americans in the quality of end-of-life care. Therefore, increasing the use of hospice care by older African Americans may result in a greater likelihood of high quality, patient-centered end-of-life care for this vulnerable population.  Like other healh disparities research, much of the literature on racial disparities in hospice use has focused on documenting the problem rather than seeking solutions. There is little empiric research identifying modifiable factors which may influence the use of hospice of care. Preliminary work suggests that hospice providers may be one target for interventions to increase access to hospice for older African Americans. This idea is supported by significant variability in the practices and policies of individual hospice providers beyond requirements for Medicare certification and the large variability across hospice service areas in the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries who enroll in hospice. This variability is even greater among African Americans and is not explained by decedent demographics or healthcare market factors. Additionally, although health care organizational culture is increasing being recognized as an important determinant of health disparities, much of the literature on organizational factors associated with the use of hospice by African Americans includes expert opinion of strategies that should work (i.e. community-based partnerships), but there have been no well- controlled analyses attempting to determine which of these strategies work best under which circumstances.  The overall goal of this project is to identify modifiable practices of hospice providers that are associated with greater use of hospice care by older African Americans in their service area. Using a survey and qualitative interview of a national sample of hospice providers, the study's specific aims will examine the association between the admission policies, community outreach practices, and other organizational characteristics, such as staff diversity, goals and strategic planning of hospice providers and service to older African Americans in their service area. Understanding which organizational practices are associated with greater use of hospice by African Americans will inform the development of interventions to increase access to hospice care and improve the quality of end-of-life care.           Despite higher mortality rates from a number of chronic illnesses and lower quality end-of-life care, African Americans use hospice services at lower rates that Whites. Hospice use is associated with improvements in the quality of end-of-life care. This research will identify the practices of hospice providers (i.e. community partnerships) which are associated with greater use of hospice care by older African Americans in their service area.

"Reducing disability via a bundled bio-behavioral-environmental approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disability in older adults is a major public health problem, particularly among low-income urban people of color. Most disabled older adults strongly prefer to live at home, but many require nursing home admission due to limitation in basic or instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs or IADLs). Since these costly admissions are preventable, testing novel, cost-effective interventions to improve ADLs should be a public health priority. Previous research has not comprehensively addressed individuals and the environment in which they function yet low income older adults suffer from health disparities in both their function and their home environments. We propose a two-group randomized trial to test the efficacy of our bio-behavioral-environmental intervention, Community Aging in Place - Advancing Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE), which combines evidence-based nursing, occupational therapy, and handyman components. In a randomized controlled pilot trial, the CAPABLE intervention had preliminary effect sizes of 0.63 and 0.62 for reducing difficulty in ADLs and IADLs respectively, when comparing the mean changes in the intervention group to the control group from baseline to follow up. These pilot findings warrant an efficacy trial. We will recruit low-income older (eage 65), principally African-American, adults with e 1 ADL or e 2 IADL limitations from the Baltimore Department of Housing Energy Assistance Program. We will interview them at home and randomize participants to either the treatment (CAPABLE intervention) or control (attention-control) group. Participants in the treatment group will receiv up to 10 in-home sessions -- d6 visits with an occupational therapist and d4 visits from a nurse - and d$1200 in safety and modification services from a licensed handyman. Each treatment participant will receive each intervention component but interventionists will systematically tailo content to the participants' risk profile and goals based on protocols. Participants in the control group will receive an equivalent number of visits, which will consist of sedentary activities with  trained research assistant (RA). All participants will be reassessed at 16 and 52 weeks in person by an RA masked to treatment condition. The primary endpoint is the ability to complete ADLs and IADLs without difficulty at 16 weeks post-randomization. Other endpoints include lower extremity mobility, health-related quality of life, and home safety at 16 weeks and ADL and IADL limitations at 52 weeks post-randomization. We will examine moderators of treatment success and mediating mechanisms. We will also evaluate cost-effectiveness based on the cost of the intervention and health care utilization. The study is designed to detect clinically meaningful improvement in ADL or IADL limitations between the intervention and control group with 80 percent power (alpha = 0.05) in an intention to treat analysis. The innovative study will provide economic evidence for a theory-driven intervention that could rein in costs of a growing and increasingly diverse older adult population.          Disability in older adults is a major public health problem, particularly among low-income, urban people of color. Most adults with disabilities strongly prefer to live at home, but many have difficulty taking care of themselves. This study proposes to test the efficacy of a newly developed bio- behavioral-environmental intervention, Community Aging in Place - Advancing Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE), which combines evidence-based nursing, occupational therapy, and handyman components to help low income older adults function at home and save our nation costly nursing home care.

"Epidemiology of Suicidal Behavior in Racially/Ethnically Diverse Older Americans  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This application is in response to RFA-MD-12-001: NIMHD Health Disparities Research. One of the priority areas of this RFA is the study of health conditions associated with significant mortality that have been understudied in health disparity populations. In older Americans, suicide rates are 30% higher than in the general population, and five times higher in non-Hispanic white men age 85 years or older-as the nation continues to grow and racially/ethnically diversify with age so will the rates of suicide. Yet, little is known about suicide-related behaviors (i.e., ideation, plans, and attempts) in older adults, which are strong risk factors for actual suicide and strong indicators of extreme emotional and mental distress. Even more so, differences in suicidal behavior by race/ethnicity have hardly been investigated at all, as most studies are from non-diverse clinic samples. Moreover, most of what we know about mental health services use related to suicide risk in older Americans comes from small non-diverse samples of suicide completers. However, understanding mental health services use and racial disparities in use is important, as all aging adults with emotional and mental distress related to suicidal thoughts and behaviors may benefit from service use and treatment. The proposed project will investigate the prevalence and predictors of suicidal ideation and related behaviors over the lifetime of older racially and ethnically diverse adults, that is, capturing transitions from ideation to plans and attempts and examining risk of late life and current suicidal behavior. It will also investigate mental health services use in those at increased risk of suicide. The aims will be addressed by studying three nationally representative aggregated data sets: 1) the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), a probability sample of the general U.S.; 2) the National Survey of American Life (NSAL), a probability sample of African- American, Afro-Caribbean, and non-Hispanic White Americans; and 3) the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), a probability sample of Latinos and Asian Americans. The project proposes to make innovative use of the combined data and examine a large, nationally-based cohort of over 3,600 respondents aged 55 and older. In a very cost-efficient approach, this project will be the first comprehensive examination of the prevalence and predictors of suicide-related behaviors and mental health services use in older Americans. Key predictors, including sociodemographic variables, psychiatric disorders, and chronic medical conditions associated with suicidal behavior will be determined (Aims 1 and 2)-assessing differences of associations overall and by race/ethnicity, that is, in older non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. In addition, racial disparities will be assessed separately for men and women (Aim 3), and key predictors of mental health services use will be examined overall and by race/ethnicity (Aim 4). Information stemming from this project will be important for identifying those older adults most at risk of suicide and with great need of care-helping to define national priorities for suicide prevention in late life for all Americans.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicidal risk profoundly impacts individuals, families, and society. Knowledge gained from this proposal will be both novel and critical for understanding the occurrence and predictors of suicide-related behaviors (i.e., ideation, planning, and attempts) in older Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White Americans, including use of mental health services in those at increased risk of suicide. Thus, this proposed project will have unique public health importance, because it will provide evidence for future psychiatric research and policy planning that will help to define national priorities for suicide prevention in late life for all Americans.",Epidemiology of Suicidal Behavior in Racially/Ethnically Diverse Older Americans,8600900,R01MD007019,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Anxiety ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Moods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Societies ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Respondent ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' stem ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2014,296400,0.04885192397603233
"Older adults in vulnerable communities: Health and quality of life over time DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diversity, its growth and complexity, are defining features of the dramatic aging of the world-wide population. Research demonstrates that older adults from disadvantaged populations are at elevated risk of poor health, disability and premature death. The National Institutes of Health are committed to reducing and eliminating health disparities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that health disparities related to sexual orientation are one of the main gaps in health disparities research. Existing evidence demonstrates that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) older adults are an at-risk, under-investigated and under-served health disparate population. This study will examine the determinants of health impacting LGB older adults to assess change in health and quality of life (QOL) over time. Based on an innovative resilience conceptual framework, the pro- posed longitudinal research will obtain data from 2,000 LGB older adults who participated in the original study in order to allow us to understand the inter-relationships between risk and protective factors as well as cohort effects as they impact health and QOL of LGB older adults over time. This multidisciplinary collaboration of University of Washington researchers and community-based collaborators addresses a critical gap by identifying modifiable mechanisms impacting health and QOL over time. The primary goals of the project are as follows: 1) Investigate how lifetime victimization, everyday discrimination, stress (perceived stress and physiological response to stress) and health behavior change affects health and QOL of LGB older adults over time; 2) Evaluate how social relations (time-varying) and sexual identity management (time-varying) affect the associations among everyday discrimination, stress, health and QOL over time; and, 3) Test whether there is cohort heterogeneity in overall levels and age growth trajectories of health and QOL, and to what extent the differences in experiences within a historical context (e.g., time of sexual identity disclosure, lifetime victimization) between Baby Boom and Silent Generation LGB older adults account for these cohort effects. As the population ages, the health care costs associated with health disparities will continue to rise. To respond to this growing public health challenge it is imperative to identfy groups at high risk of disparities and to determine the modifiable mechanisms impacting their health and QOL as they age. The findings from this project will generate needed information to directly inform and guide the development of tailored interventions that can be effectively delivered within community-based agency settings to improve the health and QOL of demographically diverse older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the population ages, the health care costs associated with health disparities continue to rise. To reduce health disparities it is imperative to identify grous at risk of disparities and to determine the modifiable factors impacting their health and quality o life. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) older adults have been identified as an at-risk, under-investigated, and under-served health disparate population. This longitudinal research will identify risk and protective mechanisms impacting the health and quality of life of LGB older adults, which will directly contribute to the development of tailored interventions to improve the health of demographically diverse older adults.",Older adults in vulnerable communities: Health and quality of life over time,8903372,R01AG026526,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Baby Booms ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Generation Effect ', ' Cohort Effect ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Housing ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Time Management ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Complex ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' peer ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Health behavior change ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' longitudinal design ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBTI ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,37080,0.18213166306425996
"Built Environment and Health Care Use: Disparities Among Chronically Ill Elders  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Associations between characteristics of the neighborhoods in which older people live and late-life disparities in chronic illness have been the subject of a rapidly growing field of research. For low-income and minority elders with chronic illness, disparities in access to and quality of care contribute to disparities in the burden of illness. Research on chronic illness has also underscored the links between inadequate physician oversight, potentially preventable hospitalizations, and poor health outcomes. However, little is known about the ways in which neighborhood environmental factors - beyond local supply of medical services - inform how urban older adults with chronic illness use physician services to manage their health. This study addresses this gap by examining the relationships between neighborhood built environment (e.g. walk-ability, access to public transit), use of physician services, and preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits among elderly, chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries who live in New York City. Specifically, the study aims to:  1) Examine associations between neighborhood built environment and physician service use among  urban, chronically ill older adults;  2) Determine whether and to what extent variations in the built environment influence potentially  preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits; and  3) Reassess findings from Aims 1 and 2 by applying: (i) alternative modeling techniques; and (ii) tests of  endogeneity to address the potential sorting of patients into neighborhoods with different characteristics  based on service use and outcomes.  The study will be based on longitudinal analysis of existing data on a sample of NYC-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older, linking individual characteristics and service use measures with small area- level data from other sources. Analyses will focus on patients with congestive heart failure and diabetes - two major contributors to preventable hospitalizations. This study will provide insight into the interdependence of clinical, social, economic, and environmental factors that influence quality of chronic illness care and, ultimately, quality of life, for older adults with multiple co-morbidities. The proposed research will apply and expand on the candidate's training throughout the K01 award period, including advanced methodological training in epidemiology and health economics. The training and research activities will lay the foundation for an R01 application in the later years of the award. Findings from this study and future research will ultimately be applied toward developing effective interventions to improve access to, continuity, and quality of ambulatory care for chronically ill elders living in underserved communities and, in turn, mitigate late-life health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant socio-economic and racial/ethnic disparities exist in the burden of chronic illness among older adults, due partly to disparities in access to and quality of ambulatory care aimed at preventing chronic illness complications. Although prior research has examined geographic variations in health care access across areas such as counties, little is known about how variations in environmental and socio-economic factors at the neighborhood level influence disparities in service use and outcomes among vulnerable groups, particularly low-income and minority elders. This study aims to address this gap by examining the relationships between neighborhood built environment, use of physician services, and preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits among elderly, chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries who live in New York City.",Built Environment and Health Care Use: Disparities Among Chronically Ill Elders,8716627,K01AG039463,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Award ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Catchment Area (Health) ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' Transportation ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' Services ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' social ', ' medical supply ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' beneficiary ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' demographics ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' effective intervention ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' ']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,K01,2014,116000,0.00400776226366246
"Epidemiology of Psychological Distress in a Chinese Aging Population This goal of our project is to conduct an epidemiological study to elucidate the relationship between culture factors and psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults. More specifically, we will examine the trajectory of psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults, to quantify the relation between normative responsibilities with their psychological wellbeing, to quantify the degree of influence to which normative responsibilities influences health-related factors associated with psychological wellbeing, and to examine the gender differences. Our secondary aims are to explore the feasibilities of testing the inter-relations between subjective and physiological measures of psychological wellbeing; and to explore the socio-cultural context in the normative responsibilities. Chinese aging population is increasing rapidly in US and globally. However, there are marked health disparities, especially surround the issues of psychological wellbeing, suicide, violence and elder mistreatment (elder abuse, neglect, financial exploitation and self-neglect). In addition, there are linguistic and cultural complexities and nuances when studying these issues. Moreover, there has been inadequate grass-root support necessary to empower and enable the Chinese communities to fully participate in the research process as equal partners on culturally sensitive issues. Accordingly, we will build on our prior community-based participatory research to quantify the mechanisms between important cultural factors and the trajectory of psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults. In this application, a culturally capable principal investigator and a multi-institutional interdisciplinary team will build on our prior efforts to collaborate with Chinese community organizations. The findings from this proposal could inform health care professionals, researcher, community, and policy makers to identify risk/protective factors, better understand disease pathway, inform future prevention and intervention studies, and inform the practice and policy to improve psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults. Public Health Relevance:  This proposal will conduct an epidemiological study to quantify the trajectory of older adult's psychological wellbeing and to examine factors associated with filial responsibilities, family conflict, and psychological wellbeing in Chinese older men and women.

"HIV Testing, Linkage and Retention in Care: Contextual Factors and Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to determine if associations exist between the contexts in which people obtain healthcare (i.e., healthcare context) or live (i.e., residential context) and each of five outcomes (HIV testing, receipt of tes results, linkage to HIV/AIDS care, retention in HIV care and HIV viral load). The epidemiology of HIV/AIDS among racial/ethnic minorities (specifically, Blacks and Latinos) and older adults (i.e., 50 and older) suggests they may encounter barriers that contribute to disparities in early detection of HIV and in their prognoses. Hence, we will also examine disparities in the outcomes by race/ethnicity and older age (age >50).  Drawing on the socio-behavioral sciences, the study will inform clinical practice in ways that promote equity in care across diverse groups, neighborhood conditions and stages of adulthood. The study's primary Specific Aims are to: (1) Examine relations between healthcare context, residential context and HIV testing during primary care visits using logistic regression multilevel models with random effects based on primary care patients' electronic medical records; and, (2) Examine relations between healthcare context, residential context and receipt of HIV test results and linkage to HIV/AIDS care, respectively, among managed care enrollees newly diagnosed as HIV-positive using multilevel logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models with random effects. The secondary Specific Aim is to determine if racial/ethnic- or age-related (i.e., aged <50 vs. >50 years) disparities exist in these relationships.  Building on our work on HIV testing and care, and guided by a model integrating the Public Health Critical Race Praxis and Behavioral Model of Healthcare Utilization, the four-year study based on the electronic medical records (EMRs) of adults enrolled in the largest managed care organization in the region. We will pool data over five years (2007-2011) to examine HIV testing among all patients presenting for primary care, and to examine receipt of HIV test results, linkage to and retention in HIV/AIDS care as well as HIV viral load among all patients newly diagnosed as HIV-positive. The study will comprise four multilevel analyses of patients' residential contexts (e.g., neighborhood HIV prevalence) and healthcare contexts (e.g., characteristics of the patient population) relative to HIV testing durin primary care visits (Aim 1), receipt of HIV test results and linkage to HIV/AIDS care among those diagnosed as HIV-positive (Aim 2), retention in HIV/AIDS care and HIV RNA viral load up to one-year post diagnosis. We will use personal and geospatial codes in the EMRs to link to: (1) files containing detailed information on each provider (e.g., demographics, specialty); (2) public data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on HIV prevalence and HIV test sites in each zip code; (3) 2010 Census socioeconomic data (e.g., concentrated poverty) for each zip code; and, (4) global positioning system software to calculate the distance from a patient's home to their provider. This interdisciplinary, inter- institutional collaboration leveraes the expertise of a diverse team of new and seasoned investigators.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to learn why adults, especially racial/ethnic minorities and older adults, who have insurance may nevertheless not receive HIV testing or HIV/AIDS care at the recommended levels. The study compares MCO enrollees based on their medical records, assigned providers and neighborhood social conditions to see if certain patients have a harder time getting testing or care because of the type of provider they see or because of where they live.                    ","HIV Testing, Linkage and Retention in Care: Contextual Factors and Disparities",8732429,R01NR014789,"['Acquired

"Health Care Partners in Cancer Prevention and Care Among the Aged    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We plan to implement a novel, community based educational program to inform and motivate underserved older adults to forge partnerships with their doctors, targeting cancer prevention as a shared goal. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will evaluate the efficacy of our social learning theory based intervention that promotes patient participation in order to enhance patient centered medical care. This study builds on findings of our ongoing study of Health Care Partnerships in Cancer Prevention and Care. Specifically we propose a multi-modal health communication training program for older adults. This educational intervention (""Speak Up"" program), aims to improve patient initiative, competence, and confidence in communication with physicians. Based on foundations of social learning theory the intervention is expected to result in increased discussion between older adults and their primary care physicians about cancer prevention and screening. Participants in the intervention are also expected to receive more age and risk specific preventive advice from their doctors and report greater satisfaction with their health care. Participants in the ""Speak Up"" facilitated discussion groups (N=480) will be compared to participants in ""Connect"" attention control groups (N=480). The latter program addresses important goals of enhancing civic and social engagement. The intervention program will be conducted in small groups and offer user-friendly experiential learning including information, discussion, and role play in order to help older persons develop better communication skills. The study will be conducted among randomly selected community dwelling elders who had participated in our prior research, and among community based older adults who attend Senior Center nutrition programs, sponsored by Area Agencies on Aging (AAA). Based on comparing pre-intervention assessments with 2 week, 6 month, and 12 month telephone follow-up evaluations, we will determine both the short term and long term impact of the intervention. We will consider participants' personal characteristics and their physicians' background and supportiveness as they may influence uptake of the intervention. We designed the study based on intervention research (CONSORT) guidelines for conducting RCTs, and will carefully evaluate treatment fidelity. In addition to patient reported outcomes, we will also consider objective indices based on Medicare claims data and AAA data on program utilization. We will use multilevel models with fixed and random effects in our quantitative data analyses. Using a mixed methods design, we will also include a qualitative study component based on in-depth interviews with 60 participants selected based on high versus low program benefits. Our study is closely aligned with the mission of the National Cancer Institute to improve cancer control and to reduce health disparities in cancer prevention and care. We plan an active dissemination effort to insure that this portable and cost effective intervention may be widely adopted by community organizations such as Area Agencies on Aging that serve diverse older adults.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study has direct relevance to public health. Our goal is to improve older patients' advocacy skills and their ability to communicate with their physicians regarding cancer prevention and general medical care. We expect that the confidence and initiative they will acquire as a result of our intervention will result in improvements in the preventive care they will receive. Having well informed patients, who also respect physician expertise, participating in medical encounters, will improve both efficiency and effectiveness of office visits for the aged. Prevention and early detection of cancer have been recognized as important public health strategies for reducing the burden of chronic and life threatening illnesses, both on society and on individuals. Our focus on communication skills training among low health literacy and minority elders should also contribute to minimizing health disparities.

"Urinary Dysfunction in the Elderly: Informing Accountable Urologic Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to foster the applicant's transition to aging research by combining the analytic, clinical and mentoring capabilities of our group. The proposed research will explore care delivery for older men and women with overactive bladder, with or without urinary incontinence. The results of the proposed investigation will potentially reduce health care disparities, identify opportunities to improve quality of care, and foster a paradigm shift in care delivery by informing design of coordinated care models. The overall aims of this project are: 1) to describe patient- and provider- level variation in pharmacologic intervention for older adults with overactive bladder symptoms; and, 2) to empirically identify patient and provider factors associated with treatment intensity, controlling for important clinica covariates such as incontinence.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Overactive bladder disproportionately affects older adults, with a prevalence reaching as high as 50% among those aged at least 76 years; at its most severe, the symptom complex includes urge urinary incontinence, characterized by unpredictable, embarrassing, large-volume urine loss. National costs for treating patients with overactive bladder symptoms are projected to exceed $82 billion by 2020. The project's proposed examination of variation in prescribing patterns and treatment intensity for overactive bladder will broadly inform policy makers and health system leaders interested in reducing health care disparities, improving quality of care, and designing coordinated care models for the treatment of older patients with overactive bladder.            ",Urinary Dysfunction in the Elderly: Informing Accountable Urologic Care,8757298,R03AG048130,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Constipation ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Generalists ', ' General Practitioners ', ' Gynecology ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' health services for seniors ', ' health services for older people ', ' health services for older adults ', ' Health Services for the Elderly ', ' Geriatric Health Services ', ' Health Services for the Aged ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incontinence ', ' Infection ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Nycturia ', ' Nocturia ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Testing ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Urinary tract ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Urology ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' urination urgency ', ' urinary urgency ', ' Urgent desire to urinate ', ' Urgency to pass urine ', ' micturition urgency ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' Urge Incontinence ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' urological ', ' urologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Anticholinergics ', ' Anticholinergic Agents ', ' Anti-Cholinergics ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' payment ', ' economic cost ', ' Lower urinary tract ', ' Modeling ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Overactive Bladder ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Characteristics ', ' urinary ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' economic outcome ', ' public health relevance ', ' Medicare claim ', ' ']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R03,2014,117750,0.08542363472880984
"When They Say No_Older Adults Perspectives on Home and Community Based Service     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Home- and community-based services (HCBS) are crucial to helping older adults maintain health and independence in the community. However, HCBS are underutilized, with unmet needs greatest among women, minorities, and other vulnerable older adults (e.g., those with less education). This community-based participatory research project (CBPR) is driven by community interest in enhancing understanding of individuals who decline the use of HCBS from which they could benefit. This, in turn, perpetuates unmet needs, and increases risks to older adults and strain on informal supports. The ultimate goal of the CBPR team is to devise and test a patient-centered intervention, but there is little research on this type of underutilization to inform intervention development. We propose a new construct to describe this phenomenon, contrautilization of HCBS (CU-HCBS). Individuals who are contrautilizing HCBS have unmet needs for services, are aware of available services that they can access, but refuse or decline services. CU- HCBS is a refinement of underutilization and may form a basis for enhancing equitable access to needed services for older adults. The CBPR team proposes to conduct descriptive research through a qualitative, phenomenological study to explore CU-HCBS. Study aims are to: 1) identify and describe dimensions (e.g., passive/active avoidance, duration) and correlates (e.g., mistrust, stigma, autonomy) of CU-HCBS drawn from the perspectives of older adult contrautilizers in 12-20 semi-structured focus groups (FGs) (n=6-10 each), segmented by gender and race (White, African American); 2) distinguish among CU-HCBS dimensions and correlates in terms of importance and patient-centeredness (i.e., respectful and responsive to preferences, needs, values) by convening 3 to 5 FGs (n=6-10 each) of older adult contrautilizers, and 6 to 9 FGs (n=6-10 each) of key stakeholders (i.e., caregivers, agency leaders); and 3) assess the modifiability of CU-HCBS dimensions and correlates using semi-structured interviews with a subsample (n=12-18) of older adults who participated in Aim 1 FGs and, de-novo, a group (n=12-18) of older adults who recently changed from CU- HCBS to HCBS utilization.

"Health Care Partners in Cancer Prevention and Care Among Aged - Competing Renewal    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We plan to implement a novel, community based educational program to inform and motivate underserved older adults to forge partnerships with their doctors, targeting cancer prevention as a shared goal. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will evaluate the efficacy of our social learning theory based intervention that promotes patient participation in order to enhance patient centered medical care. This study builds on findings of our ongoing study of Health Care Partnerships in Cancer Prevention and Care. Specifically we propose a multi-modal health communication training program for older adults. This educational intervention (""Speak Up"" program), aims to improve patient initiative, competence, and confidence in communication with physicians. Based on foundations of social learning theory the intervention is expected to result in increased discussion between older adults and their primary care physicians about cancer prevention and screening. Participants in the intervention are also expected to receive more age and risk specific preventive advice from their doctors and report greater satisfaction with their health care. Participants in the ""Speak Up"" facilitated discussion groups (N=480) will be compared to participants in ""Connect"" attention control groups (N=480). The latter program addresses important goals of enhancing civic and social engagement. The intervention program will be conducted in small groups and offer user-friendly experiential learning including information, discussion, and role play in order to help older persons develop better communication skills. The study will be conducted among randomly selected community dwelling elders who had participated in our prior research, and among community based older adults who attend Senior Center nutrition programs, sponsored by Area Agencies on Aging (AAA). Based on comparing pre-intervention assessments with 2 week, 6 month, and 12 month telephone follow-up evaluations, we will determine both the short term and long term impact of the intervention. We will consider participants' personal characteristics and their physicians' background and supportiveness as they may influence uptake of the intervention. We designed the study based on intervention research (CONSORT) guidelines for conducting RCTs, and will carefully evaluate treatment fidelity. In addition to patient reported outcomes, we will also consider objective indices based on Medicare claims data and AAA data on program utilization. We will use multilevel models with fixed and random effects in our quantitative data analyses. Using a mixed methods design, we will also include a qualitative study component based on in-depth interviews with 60 participants selected based on high versus low program benefits. Our study is closely aligned with the mission of the National Cancer Institute to improve cancer control and to reduce health disparities in cancer prevention and care. We plan an active dissemination effort to insure that this portable and cost effective intervention may be widely adopted by community organizations such as Area Agencies on Aging that serve diverse older adults.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study has direct relevance to public health. Our goal is to improve older patients' advocacy skills and their ability to communicate with their physicians regarding cancer prevention and general medical care. We expect that the confidence and initiative they will acquire as a result of our intervention will result in improvements in the preventive care they will receive. Having well informed patients, who also respect physician expertise, participating in medical encounters, will improve both efficiency and effectiveness of office visits for the aged. Prevention and early detection of cancer have been recognized as important public health strategies for reducing the burden of chronic and life threatening illnesses, both on society and on individuals. Our focus on communication skills training among low health literacy and minority elders should also contribute to minimizing health disparities.

"Mobile Telecare for Underserved African-American Elders with Heart Failure     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Older adults who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid are among the sickest and poorest individuals covered in either program. Although they have a significantly higher prevalence of chronic conditions, such as heart failure (HF) than all other Medicare beneficiaries, as few as 2% of dual eligible patients receive the type of case management or care coordination that can prevent hospitalizations and emergency department visits for acute medical problems. African-Americans are particularly at risk, having the highest rates of HF-related hospitalizations compared to all other Medicare beneficiaries. In this Phase I SBIR, we will conduct a pilot clinical trial to test a care coordination program designed for African-American dual eligible older adults with HF who have been discharged from a regional hospital and who are being cared for by community-based health care providers. The proposed Mobile Heart Care Coordination (MHCC) program integrates telemonitoring through a Bluetooth-enabled device and mobile phone-based communication technologies that connect hospital-based cardiac care teams with community-based providers. The goal of the program is to provide coordinated post-discharge care in order to reduce potentially-avoidable hospitalizations and emergency room visits. This Phase I SBIR will develop and test the MHCC intervention's feasibility and short-term outcomes for dual eligible African-Americans with HF. In a Phase II application, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial with African-American dual-eligible older adults with HF to determine whether participants in the MHCC- enhanced program are less likely to be readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge (primary hypothesis) and less likely to access emergency room care (secondary hypothesis) compared to the comparison group (usual care). The Phase I application will provide the necessary data to determine the sample size required for the larger adequately powered randomized controlled trial in Phase II. The subsequent Phase II application will result in an innovative, cost-effective, and nationally replicable care coordination model aimed at reducing potentially-avoidable hospitalizations and emergency room visits, and improving quality of care for all African- American dual eligible patients with HF.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Phase I intervention tests a culturally tailored, community-based, low cost intervention that relies on telemonitoring and communication technologies to improve care coordination and reduce potentially- avoidable costly hospitalizations and emergency room visits for African-American dual eligibles with heart failure. If successful, this intervention offers a cost-effective model for significantly reducing health disparities among nearly 200,000 African-American dual eligibles with heart failure nationwide as well as other older adult African Americans with HF.

"Stress Biomarkers as a Potential Link Between Age Beliefs and Health     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Experimental and longitudinal studies have found that older individuals with more negative age beliefs demonstrate worse health outcomes. The mechanism that explains this process is not known. The overall aim of the proposed project is to investigate for the first time whether stress biomarkers over time reflect a biological process tha links negative age beliefs (defined as disparaging perceptions that are assimilated from society about older individuals as a category) with worse health of older individuals. The importance of examining stress biomarkers as the potential mechanism is enhanced by their potential ability to provide a previously unexamined explanation for racial and gender disparities in aging health. The proposed project will draw on two ongoing complementary longitudinal datasets that focus on community-dwelling older individuals. Thus, we will pursue the following aims and hypotheses for the first time: Aim 1: Examine whether older individuals' age beliefs are associated with stress biomarkers over time. Hypothesis 1: Older individuals' negative age beliefs will predict elevated stress biomarkers over time. Aim 2: Examine whether racial and gender disparities exist in the influence of older individuals' age beliefs on stress biomarkers over time. Hypothesis 2a: Older African Americans will be more vulnerable than same-aged older whites to the adverse impact of negative age beliefs on stress biomarkers over time. Hypothesis 2b: Older women will be more vulnerable than same-aged older men to the adverse impact of negative age beliefs on stress biomarkers over time. Aim 3: Examine whether older individuals' stress biomarkers over time mediate the relationship between age beliefs and worse cognitive and physical health over time. Hypothesis 3: Older individuals' stress biomarkers will mediate the relationship between negative age beliefs and worse cognitive health (i.e., memory deficits, risk of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, and smaller hippocampal volume) and worse physical health (i.e., physical-function deficits, risk of cardiovascular events, and higher mortality) over time. Aim 4: Identify the factors that moderate negative age beliefs' influence on older individuals' stress biomarkers over time. Hypothesis 4: Resiliency factors (i.e. Feeling Useful to Others, Openness, and Emotional Stability) and vulnerability factors (i.e., Age-belief Self-relevance and Adverse Life Events) will moderate negative age beliefs' effect on stress biomarkers over time. This study could identify a new and potentially modifiable process, negative age beliefs' association with stress biomarkers over time, as a factor that contributes to adverse health outcomes among older individuals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many individuals are bombarded with a variety of negative age beliefs, throughout their lifespans, that become associated with worse health in later life. The overall goal of the proposed project is to examine whether biological indicators of stress are the mechanism that explains the harmful effects of older individuals' negative age beliefs on their cognitive and physical health. The proposed project could provide the foundation for developing targeted interventions that improve the health of older individuals in general and older women and older African Americans in particular.            ",Stress Biomarkers as a Potential Link Between Age Beliefs and Health,8697840,R01AG032284,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Baltimore ', ' Belief ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Inflammation ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Memory ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Perception ', ' Personality ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Metabolic ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Physical Function ', ' hypothalamic pituitary axis ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Emotional ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Negative Finding ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,166500,3.271808054852567e-06
"Filial Piety and Psychosocial Well-being in Chinese Population This application is a re-submission of our prior application (R01 MD006173) to examine the relationship between adult children 's filial piety and psychosocial wellbeing of Chinese older adults. Despite the rapid growth of Chinese populations, we have the most rudimentary understanding of many important issues facing the US Chinese older adults. More specifically, there are significant disparities in psychosocial wellbeing among Chinese older adults, who have the highest suicide rate than any other racial/ethnic group in the US. This marked health disparity is further exacerbated by the linguistic and cultural complexities when studying these issues as well as the inadequate community support necessary to empower the Chinese community to be fully engaged as equal partners in research. These impediments necessitate a deeper understanding broader contextual cultural factors associated with psychosocial distress, through the development of sustainable community-academic partnership and the reciprocal transfer of expertise to improve the health of the Chinese population.    Accordingly, we will leverage a comprehensive model of community-based participatory research (CBPR) to examine the relationship between important cultural factors and psychosocial wellbeing of Chinese older adults. Among many important cultural factors , filial piety is the most important and defines relationships between adult children and their parents. Improved understanding of filial piety could improve our understanding of a key contextual factor that may affect psychosocial wellbeing of Chinese older adults. The primary specific aims are to: 1) examine the relationship between adult children 's filial piety with older adult's psychosocial wellbeing; 2) examine the relationship between the discrepancies in adult children 's filial behaviors and older adult's filial expectations with the psychosocial wellbeing of older adults; and 3) examine the degree to which adult children 's filial piety influences other risk factors associated with psychological distress and social isolation of older adults. The secondary specific aims are to: 4) explore the influence of other relevant cultural factors on above relationship (aims 1-3); and 5) identify through semi-structure interviews the stress, barriers, challenges and cultural variations in the adherence and expectation of filial piety in both adult children and older adults. To achieve these objectives, a bilingual and bicultural principal investigator and an experienced interdisciplinary team will build on our NIH funded CBPR projects to collaborate with Chicago Chinese community groups.

"Older adults in vulnerable communities: Health and quality of life over time     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diversity, its growth and complexity, are defining features of the dramatic aging of the world-wide population. Research demonstrates that older adults from disadvantaged populations are at elevated risk of poor health, disability and premature death. The National Institutes of Health are committed to reducing and eliminating health disparities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that health disparities related to sexual orientation are one of the main gaps in health disparities research. Existing evidence demonstrates that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) older adults are an at-risk, under-investigated and under-served health disparate population. This study will examine the determinants of health impacting LGB older adults to assess change in health and quality of life (QOL) over time. Based on an innovative resilience conceptual framework, the pro- posed longitudinal research will obtain data from 2,000 LGB older adults who participated in the original study in order to allow us to understand the inter-relationships between risk and protective factors as well as cohort effects as they impact health and QOL of LGB older adults over time. This multidisciplinary collaboration of University of Washington researchers and community-based collaborators addresses a critical gap by identifying modifiable mechanisms impacting health and QOL over time. The primary goals of the project are as follows: 1) Investigate how lifetime victimization, everyday discrimination, stress (perceived stress and physiological response to stress) and health behavior change affects health and QOL of LGB older adults over time; 2) Evaluate how social relations (time-varying) and sexual identity management (time-varying) affect the associations among everyday discrimination, stress, health and QOL over time; and, 3) Test whether there is cohort heterogeneity in overall levels and age growth trajectories of health and QOL, and to what extent the differences in experiences within a historical context (e.g., time of sexual identity disclosure, lifetime victimization) between Baby Boom and Silent Generation LGB older adults account for these cohort effects. As the population ages, the health care costs associated with health disparities will continue to rise. To respond to this growing public health challenge it is imperative to identfy groups at high risk of disparities and to determine the modifiable mechanisms impacting their health and QOL as they age. The findings from this project will generate needed information to directly inform and guide the development of tailored interventions that can be effectively delivered within community-based agency settings to improve the health and QOL of demographically diverse older adults.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the population ages, the health care costs associated with health disparities continue to rise.

"Maximizing the Impact of ePHIM in Low-Income, Multiethnic Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to access, manage, and understand personal health information enables individuals to become  better consumers and participate more fully in making health care decisions.  The development of electronic health records and the availability of patient portals for accessing personal health records, coupled with myriad health information via the internet (eHealth), have provided the potential for electronic personal health information management (ePHIM).  However, great variability exists in access to eHealth information for components of the US population. Despite continuing efforts, this ""digital divide"" remains for rural, minority and low-income communities.  Limited access for ePHIM contributes to the health disparities experienced by these populations.  The goal of this project is to improve the ability of low-income African American, American Indian, Latino, and white older adults living in rural and urban communities to use information technology applications for ePHIM.  The project's conceptual framework combines the Technology Acceptance Model and the person- environmental interaction model.  It uses a community-based participatory partnership of Wake Forest School  of Medicine and its Outpatient Department Medicine Clinic, with Community Partners HealthNet, a network of  18 clinics serving 25 rural North Carolina counties, to achieve 3 specific aims:  (1) document the ePHIM  experience, knowledge, perceived needs, and perceived risks of low-income African American, American  Indian, Latino, and white older adults living in rural and urban communities~ (2) delineate the actual use of  ePHIM by low-income African American, American Indian, Latino, and white older adults living in rural and  urban communities~ and (3) delineate differences in perception, belief and experience in using ePHIM between  patients and caregivers who use versus those who do not use ePHIM.  This project is significant because it will delineate disparities in ePHIM by working with two networks of clinics (Community Partners HealthNet~ Outpatient Department Medicine Clinic/Wake Forest Baptist Health) that provides care to rural and urban, low- income, and minority patients.  Working with these networks, this project will implement in-depth and longitudinal research that will delineate the factors affecting ePHIM use among vulnerable elders.  This project is innovative.  (1)  It will use qualitative data collection techniques within a community-based participatory research framework to assess the motives and barriers to patients' and caregivers' ePHIM among rural as well as urban, low-income, older adult, and minority communities.  (2) It emphasizes the importance of including caregivers, particularly for older adults, in understanding the use of ePHIM.   (3) It will use these qualitative methods to assess the perceptions of health care providers and IT providers about the potential use of ePHIM.   (4) It will use these qualitative methods to determine the factors that facilitated and limited the use of ePHIM by comparing high / expert, medium, and low users.  (5) It will document the actual pattern of ePHIM use among older adults and their caregivers over a one-year period.  (6) It will explore the association of ePHIM use and chronic disease management among older adults.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to access, manage and understand personal health information enables individuals to become better consumers and to participate more fully in making health care decisions.

"Cohort differences in social life and health:  Refreshing the NSHAP sample     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP) is a longitudinal study of older adults designed to examine the mechanisms by which social factors-such as intimate relationships and social networks-affect and are affected by health. In 2005-06, questionnaire and biomeasure data were collected from a nationally- representative sample of 3,005 community-dwelling adults ages 57-85 (W1). These referent respondents were reinterviewed in 2010-11, together with coresident spouses/partners (W2). A third wave (W3), to be collected in 2015-16, will reinterview all surviving referent respondents and W2 spouses/partners. Collectively, NSHAP's W1, W2 and W3 provide extensive, longitudinal, health and social information for a nationally representative sample of older adults. We aim to add a new cohort to the NSHAP sample to capture the unique and epidemiologically intriguing ""Baby Boom"" cohort. Funding for refreshing the sample with a new cohort of aging ""Baby Boomers"" (i.e., respondents born from 1948 through 1965) will substantially increase the value of NSHAP for various research communities, opening up key avenues for conducting innovative and effective health related research, such as: (1) comparing the social connections, networks, environment and relationships of older adults in different birth cohorts and the relationship of these social factors with health; (2) tracing cohort differences in the life courseof cohabitations and marital relationships; (3) comparing trajectories of physical function, self-rate health, health behaviors, prevalence of chronic diseases, and physiological functioning across ages over birth cohorts; (4) tracking the transition from middle-age to older ages; and (5) capturing racial and ethnic differences in the ages at which relevant chronic conditions become prevalent across cohorts.  Funding will support adding over 2,500 respondents. The addition of respondents ages 50 to 67 in 2015- 16 will provide a nationally-representative, high-quality data set on social relationships and health for ages 50 to 95, setting the stage for a sequential cohort design. The addition of the Baby Boom cohort will allow researchers to compare health and social outcomes along age, period, and cohort axes. We will harmonize data collection with W3 of NSHAP to form a single, cohesive dataset, including in-home interviews with 1,600 new respondents born between 1948-1965 and their spouses or co-residential romantic partners (n=900). This will yield extensive, nationally representative, self-reported and biomeasure data on multiple cohorts' physical and mental health, physical and cognitive functioning, medication use, and pathways of health and mortality within social contexts, facilitating comparative assessments of health disparities between gender, race, ethnicity and socio- economic status by age within and across cohorts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP) is a longitudinal study of older adults designed to examine the mechanisms by which social factors-such as intimate relationships and social networks-affect and are affected by health.

"Rural Health Clinics in Accountable Care Organizations: Impact on Disparities The proposed longitudinal study investigates the care provided by Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) to older  adults in the Southern region of the U.S., as well as the costs of that care. Accountable Care Organizations  (ACOs) offer potential opportunities to RHCs despite several rural constraints to ACO participation.  However, little is known about how the ACO model accommodates the unique challenges of RHCs, and the  impact of RHC participation on the health disparities of rural older adults including those of minority groups.  The specific aims of the study are: 1) to analyze and describe the extent of RHC participation in ACOs, and  the characteristics of RHCs that choose to participate in ACOs; 2) to analyze ACO participation and other  factors that impact health disparities of rural populations served by RHCs; and 3) to analyze ACO  participation and other factors that impact cost efficiency and preventive care effectiveness for RHC older  adult patients. The major research hypotheses are: 1) A higher percentage of provider-based RHCs will  participate in ACOs compared to independent RHCs; 2) RHCs in networks will be more likely to participate  in ACOs than unaffiliated RHCs; 3) Large RHCs are more likely to participate in ACOs than small RHCs; 4)  RHC participation in ACOs is positively related to reduction of disparities of older adult rural patients,  controlling for the effects of contextual factors; 5) RHC participation in ACOs is positively related to quality of  care practices, controlling for the effects of contextual factors (such as ethnic/racial distribution and rurality);  6) RHC participation in ACOs is positively related to health outcomes of older adult rural patients, controlling  for the effects of contextual factors (such as ethnic/racial distribution and rurality); and 7) RHC participation  in ACOs will have a positive impact on cost efficiency and preventive care effectiveness. We will triangulate  our analyses by using both quantitative and qualitative research methods including analysis of secondary  data, survey research, and case studies. Multivariate analyses of seven years of organizational and  community-related data of a panel of approximately 800 RHCs will be performed in order to develop more  generalizable ideas about the factors contributing to RHC performance and outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) face numerous challenges such as serving communities with higher rates of  chronic disease compared to urban communities, & attracting & retaining qualified professional staff.

"Community Choirs to Promote Healthy Aging and Independence of Older Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The United States is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults. In 2009, there were 39.6 million individuals over age 65, and this number is expected to almost double by 2030. During the same time period, there will be an increase in the number of older adults with diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds who are at increased risk for poor health outcomes relative to non-minority elders. Thus, there is an immediate need to identify cost-effective, widely applicable, and sustainable programs that promote health and well-being of older adults. A growing body of literature suggests that participation in community choral singing may also have positive health benefits for older adults, but there is a need to evaluate the efficacy of a choral program for diverse older adults, and a well-designed randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to help strengthen the evidence base. Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to test the efficacy of community choir program for maintaining health and well-being in culturally diverse older adults. To address the aims of the study, we will evaluate a comprehensive set of outcomes that are hypothesized to be related to choral singing and complete a cost analysis. We will recruit 450 diverse older adults and will utilize 12 existing Administration on Aging-supported senior centers to implement a multi-site, randomized (by center) clinical trial (RCT). Centers will be randomized to receive the choir program immediately (intervention group) or after a 6-month delayed intervention phase (control group). The community choirs will be led by professional music directors. We will assess both primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 months (and 18 months for the delayed intervention group). We will also evaluate the start- up and ongoing program costs for senior centers, including cost/person served and determine quality adjusted life years. If successful, results from this RCT may help develop and further the premise that creative arts can be applied to helping solve national health priorities, such as keeping older adults active, independent, and involved in their communities in readily accessible, affordable, and sustainable ways.          The United States is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, a group that is at increased risk of poor health relative to non-minorities. There is an immediate need to identify cost-effective, widely applicable, and sustainable programs that promote health, wellbeing and independence and that are appropriate for our increasingly diverse population of older adults.

"Mechanisms of health disparities in parkinsonism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for an NIA Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development (K23) award seeks support to develop a program of research related to understanding the mechanisms of health disparities in Parkinsonism. As part of the education plan, the PI proposes to: 1) Increase her understanding of health behavior theory, geriatrics and health disparities; 2) Gain additional epidemiological skills in study design and health measurement; and 3) Acquire the analytic skills associated with psychometric and longitudinal data analysis. Along with these educational goals, there is an associated research project.  The principal research objective of this project is to understand the patient-level factors related to healthcare disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinsonian signs. Specifically, this study proposes to evaluate how older adults' aging beliefs affect the recognition of Parkinsonian signs, and how race, culture and socioeconomic status impact this relationship. To achieve these goals, there are three specific aims: 1) To validate a screening instrument for Parkinsonian signs by comparing it with neurological examination; 2) To examine older adults' beliefs regarding movement changes and their association with Parkinsonian signs and relevant patient-level characteristics; and 3) To determine the association between beliefs about aging, subsequent comorbidities, including falls and fractures, and the detection and treatment of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. After validation of a screening instrument for Parkinsonian signs, this measure will be incorporated into a cross-sectional and prospective evaluation of the relationship between aging beliefs and Parkinsonian signs, particularly as it is modified by socioeconomic factors. Subjects will be recruited and surveyed in primary care clinics and outcomes will be determined through the electronic health record. Successful completion of this project will lead to the development of educational interventions targeting improved understanding of aging related functional decline among older adults. This application will provide critical support for the PI to become an independent researcher and a leader in health services research in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aging-related movement problems are common in older adults and lead to increased disability and death. Underserved minorities may be particularly vulnerable to under-recognition and treatment of these movement problems. This research aims to understand why patients may not get appropriate and timely therapy in order to develop public health strategies to improve care for older adults.

"Influence of Adult Latina Daughters on Older Latina Mothers HIV Risk and Protective Behaviors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: HIV infection rates for older Latinos in the United States are 5 times higher than those of their non-Latino White counterparts. Researchers have shown that older Latina women (ages 50+) are at particularly increased risk of acquiring HIV infection due to factors such as sparse participation in HIV prevention programs, less HIV knowledge, and a decreased likelihood of discussing sexual and substance use behaviors and HIV protection with their primary care physicians. Additionally, Latina women report higher rates of HIV risk behaviors-such as having sex under the influence of alcohol-than non-Latina White or Black women. Recent studies have found that adult daughters may be in a unique position to influence their mothers' health-related decisions. Specifically, study findings suggest mother-daughter attachment may have a protective influence on substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors of adult Latinas. Objective: This study proposes to examine (a) associations between the HIV risk and protective behavior trajectories (over time) of adult Latina daughters and those of their older Latina mothers and (b) the influence of mother-daughter attachment and alcohol use on associations between mother-daughter HIV risk and protective behavior trajectories. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that older Latina mothers with greater mother/daughter attachment and less alcohol use will have HIV risk and protective behaviors that are most strongly associated with those of their adult Latina daughters. Design: The proposed longitudinal study will be conducted using secondary data from a 7-year study investigating the intergenerational transmission of substance use and HIV risk behavior trajectories in a community-based sample of 316 Latina mothers and daughters. Significance: Results of this study can expand scientific understanding of HIV risk and protective factors associated with older Latina women. With the number of HIV cases among this population expected to rise in the coming years, the need to better understand and address the factors that place older Latina women at increased risk for HIV is of great public health significance. This knowledge could inform research literature and clinicians about the culturally relevant and age-specific factors that should be targeted in HIV prevention programs with this population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall objective of the proposed study is to determine (a) the influence that adult Latina daughters' HIV risk and protective behaviors trajectories have on those of their older Latina mothers (b) how mother- daughter attachment and alcohol use patterns influence those associations. Results from this study can inform researchers as to appropriate strategies in reaching this difficult to access population of older Latinas, who have been historically understudied, despite their high incidence rate of HIV infection and risky behavior. This study is of high public health relevance given the severe dearth in prevention strategies aimed at decreasing the HIV-related health disparities experienced by older Latinas.            ",Influence of Adult Latina Daughters on Older Latina Mothers HIV Risk and Protective Behaviors,8993370,F31MD009553,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Behavior ', ' Berry ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Daughter ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Florida ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Influentials ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mothers ', ' Terminology ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Rose ', ' Rosa ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Walkers ', ' Woman ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Attenuated ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Safe Sex ', ' intergenerational ', ' Familiarity ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' Adult Children ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' risk perception ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Older Population ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' protective behavior ', ' Population ', ' older women ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,36720,0.007269513045303182
"Using peer mentors to extend depression care to minority older adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate seeks support through the K23 mechanism to develop the skills and mentorship necessary to become an independent clinician researcher in the area of mental health services.

"Health Care Partners in Cancer Prevention and Care Among Aged - Competing Renewal    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We plan to implement a novel, community based educational program to inform and motivate underserved older adults to forge partnerships with their doctors, targeting cancer prevention as a shared goal. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will evaluate the efficacy of our social learning theory based intervention that promotes patient participation in order to enhance patient centered medical care. This study builds on findings of our ongoing study of Health Care Partnerships in Cancer Prevention and Care. Specifically we propose a multi-modal health communication training program for older adults. This educational intervention (""Speak Up"" program), aims to improve patient initiative, competence, and confidence in communication with physicians. Based on foundations of social learning theory the intervention is expected to result in increased discussion between older adults and their primary care physicians about cancer prevention and screening. Participants in the intervention are also expected to receive more age and risk specific preventive advice from their doctors and report greater satisfaction with their health care. Participants in the ""Speak Up"" facilitated discussion groups (N=480) will be compared to participants in ""Connect"" attention control groups (N=480). The latter program addresses important goals of enhancing civic and social engagement. The intervention program will be conducted in small groups and offer user-friendly experiential learning including information, discussion, and role play in order to help older persons develop better communication skills. The study will be conducted among randomly selected community dwelling elders who had participated in our prior research, and among community based older adults who attend Senior Center nutrition programs, sponsored by Area Agencies on Aging (AAA). Based on comparing pre-intervention assessments with 2 week, 6 month, and 12 month telephone follow-up evaluations, we will determine both the short term and long term impact of the intervention. We will consider participants' personal characteristics and their physicians' background and supportiveness as they may influence uptake of the intervention. We designed the study based on intervention research (CONSORT) guidelines for conducting RCTs, and will carefully evaluate treatment fidelity. In addition to patient reported outcomes, we will also consider objective indices based on Medicare claims data and AAA data on program utilization. We will use multilevel models with fixed and random effects in our quantitative data analyses. Using a mixed methods design, we will also include a qualitative study component based on in-depth interviews with 60 participants selected based on high versus low program benefits. Our study is closely aligned with the mission of the National Cancer Institute to improve cancer control and to reduce health disparities in cancer prevention and care. We plan an active dissemination effort to insure that this portable and cost effective intervention may be widely adopted by community organizations such as Area Agencies on Aging that serve diverse older adults.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study has direct relevance to public health. Our goal is to improve older patients' advocacy skills and their ability to communicate with their physicians regarding cancer prevention and general medical care. We expect that the confidence and initiative they will acquire as a result of our intervention will result in improvements in the preventive care they will receive. Having well informed patients, who also respect physician expertise, participating in medical encounters, will improve both efficiency and effectiveness of office visits for the aged. Prevention and early detection of cancer have been recognized as important public health strategies for reducing the burden of chronic and life threatening illnesses, both on society and on individuals. Our focus on communication skills training among low health literacy and minority elders should also contribute to minimizing health disparities.

"Reducing disability via a bundled bio-behavioral-environmental approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disability in older adults is a major public health problem, particularly among low-income urban people of color. Most disabled older adults strongly prefer to live at home, but many require nursing home admission due to limitation in basic or instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs or IADLs). Since these costly admissions are preventable, testing novel, cost-effective interventions to improve ADLs should be a public health priority. Previous research has not comprehensively addressed individuals and the environment in which they function yet low income older adults suffer from health disparities in both their function and their home environments. We propose a two-group randomized trial to test the efficacy of our bio-behavioral-environmental intervention, Community Aging in Place - Advancing Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE), which combines evidence-based nursing, occupational therapy, and handyman components. In a randomized controlled pilot trial, the CAPABLE intervention had preliminary effect sizes of 0.63 and 0.62 for reducing difficulty in ADLs and IADLs respectively, when comparing the mean changes in the intervention group to the control group from baseline to follow up. These pilot findings warrant an efficacy trial. We will recruit low-income older (eage 65), principally African-American, adults with e 1 ADL or e 2 IADL limitations from the Baltimore Department of Housing Energy Assistance Program. We will interview them at home and randomize participants to either the treatment (CAPABLE intervention) or control (attention-control) group. Participants in the treatment group will receiv up to 10 in-home sessions -- d6 visits with an occupational therapist and d4 visits from a nurse - and d$1200 in safety and modification services from a licensed handyman. Each treatment participant will receive each intervention component but interventionists will systematically tailo content to the participants' risk profile and goals based on protocols. Participants in the control group will receive an equivalent number of visits, which will consist of sedentary activities with  trained research assistant (RA). All participants will be reassessed at 16 and 52 weeks in person by an RA masked to treatment condition. The primary endpoint is the ability to complete ADLs and IADLs without difficulty at 16 weeks post-randomization. Other endpoints include lower extremity mobility, health-related quality of life, and home safety at 16 weeks and ADL and IADL limitations at 52 weeks post-randomization. We will examine moderators of treatment success and mediating mechanisms. We will also evaluate cost-effectiveness based on the cost of the intervention and health care utilization. The study is designed to detect clinically meaningful improvement in ADL or IADL limitations between the intervention and control group with 80 percent power (alpha = 0.05) in an intention to treat analysis. The innovative study will provide economic evidence for a theory-driven intervention that could rein in costs of a growing and increasingly diverse older adult population. Disability in older adults is a major public health problem, particularly among low-income, urban people of color. Most adults with disabilities strongly prefer to live at home, but many have difficulty taking care of themselves. This study proposes to test the efficacy of a newly developed bio- behavioral-environmental intervention, Community Aging in Place - Advancing Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE), which combines evidence-based nursing, occupational therapy, and handyman components to help low income older adults function at home and save our nation costly nursing home care.",Reducing disability via a bundled bio-behavioral-environmental approach,8827230,R01AG040100,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Attention ', ' Baltimore ', ' Budgets ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Expenditure ', ' Goals ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Masks ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Occupational Therapist ', ' Occupational Therapy ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Medication Management ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' sedentary ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Licensing ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' R.N.

"2/2 - Suicide Prevention in Chinese Older Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This two-site (Rush University and Northwestern University) linked re-submission of R34MH100443 collaborative application aims to design a culturally tailored and community- engaged intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts in US Chinese older adults, who have the highest suicide rate than any other racial/ethnic groups. Despite this health disparity, we have great paucity in our understanding of cultural issues surrounding suicide in Chinese populations, and this has directly hampered the intervention efforts. Accordingly, we seek to support a geriatrician (Dong) with expertise in aging, mental health and Chinese culture, and an interventionist (Simon) with expertise in clinical trials using community health workers to reduce health disparities among minority populations. More specifically, we aim to 1) expand synergistic academic and community partnerships; 2) iteratively design and refine a culturally meaningful pilot intervention to reduce suicidal thought; 3) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial; and 4) rigorously evaluate the cultural acceptability of the proposed intervention at multiple levels. This study will set the cornerstone for the next R01 application to fully test the efficacy of a culturally tailored intervention to reuce suicidal thoughts in Chinese aging populations.  By 2030, Chinese older adults will account for a quarter of the world's aging populations. Despite the rapid growth of Chinese populations in the US, there are marked health disparities among Chinese older adults, which are further exacerbated by the complex linguistic and cultural nuances in studying Chinese populations, particularly on issues of suicidal thoughts. Moreover, there has been inadequate and sustainable community support necessary to empower the Chinese community to be fully engaged as equal partners in research. In this application, a bilingual and bicultural principal investigator and an interdisciplinary investigative team have leveraged the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR), building on our prior NIH funded CBPR projects to partner synergistically and sustainably with the Chicago Chinese community in order to overcome these challenges and set the foundation for this proposal. The study findings will inform clinicians, investigators, communities, social services and policy makers to: a) improve our in-depth understanding of cultural issues surrounding suicide; b) empower community to be equal partners in mental health research; c) guide the next R01 intervention study; and d) inform practice and policy on suicide care in Chinese older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This R34 resubmission will collaborative and iteratively design and refine a culturally adapted intervention to reduce the frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts in Chinese older adults.

"Risk and mechanisms of neurocognitive impairment in older HIV-infected Hispanics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) continues to be highly prevalent and debilitating in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, particularly among older persons. Hispanics are the fastest growing segment of the older adult population in the U.S., they are disproportionately represented among cases of HIV infection, and they are at elevated risk for NCI in both HIV and older age, separately. Yet, NCI among older HIV-infected Hispanics has not been examined. This Mentored Career Development Award (K23) application is designed to develop the applicant's skills to become an independent and culturally proficient clinical scientist investigating the role of risk factors for the development of NCI associated wit combined HIV infection and aging among Hispanics. The application contains a targeted research project to examine NCI in older HIV-infected Hispanics (primarily of Mexican origin/descent) and key factors driving ethnic differences in NCI associated with HIV and aging. Elucidation of psychosocial and biomedical factors that might lead to ethnic differences in NCI is a foundational step in developing targeted, culturally-relevant interventions to improve or minimize NCI, and thus reduce health disparities in this subpopulation. Among the many potential predictors of NCI, we focus on a set of potentially modifiable health behaviors that are particularly problematic among Hispanics, namely use of health services and personal practices associated with a healthy lifestyle (i.e., diet, and physical and cognitive activity). We also aim o examine some of the biomedical factors that might mediate the association of these health behaviors with NCI, including HIV disease burden and metabolic syndrome. Recognizing that Hispanics are a heterogeneous group, the research component of the present proposal focuses primarily on Hispanics of Mexican origin/descent, who are the largest Hispanic subgroup in the U.S. In support of the research proposal and the candidate's long-term goals, the comprehensive proposed training program builds on the applicant's background in clinical neuropsychology, as well as clinical research on cognitive aging and the neuropsychology of HIV, to gain key neuroAIDS knowledge (i.e. neuroAIDS disparities, and the intersection of HIV and aging), clinical research skills of particular relevance for cross-cultural studies (i.e. biostatistics, bioethics, and community engagement), as well as leadership and scientific communication skills. The multidisciplinary mentoring team includes expertise in all aspects of this proposal including neuroAIDS disparities (Primary Mentor: Dr. Robert Heaton; Co-mentor: Mara Luisa Zuniga; Consultant: Mariana Cherner; Collaborator: Dr. Mario de la Rosa); the intersection of aging and HIV (Co-Mentor: Dr. Dilip Jeste) including neuromedical implications (Consultant: Dr. Ronald Ellis); and cross-cultural psychometrics and biostatistics (Dr. Heaton and Consultants: Drs. Dan Mungas and Florin Vaida), bioethics (Dr. Zuniga), and community engagement (Dr. Zuniga). The present proposal will capitalize primarily on the University of California San Diego infrastructure, including the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program, the Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, the Division of Global Public Health, and the Clinical and Translational Research Institute. It will also leverage expertise at the Universit of California Davis, and Florida International University. The excellent mentoring team and robust infrastructure will provide critical support to the applicant to successfully complete her training goals. This key training and new experience in executing the proposed research plan, along with her past clinical and research experiences and her Hispanic background will place her in a unique position to conduct highly impactful research that will serve the needs of a growing, underserved and vulnerable segment of the U.S. population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) aims to investigate differences between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites in neurocognitive impairment (i.e., problems with attention, learning and memory, and other cognitive skills) associated with HIV and aging. This is an important public health priority because 1) neurocognitive problems in HIV are debilitating and especially prevalent as the number of HIV-infected persons reaching older age grows; and 2) Hispanics have higher rates of HIV-infection and worse HIV disease than non-Hispanic Whites, are the fastest growing ethnic group among older adults in the U.S., and have higher risk for neurocognitive problems both in HIV and in older age. Knowledge of the psychosocial and biomedical factors related to Hispanic ethnicity that increase risk for neurocognitive impairment associated with HIV and aging can help develop targeted, culturally relevant interventions to prevent and/or decrease neurocognitive impairment in this group and reduce health disparities.                 ",Risk and mechanisms of neurocognitive impairment in older

"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose here our overall plan for the Health Promotion Research Center (HPRC) at the University of Washington for the next five years. One of the original three Prevention Research Centers funded by CDC in 1986, HPRC focuses on promoting healthy aging and reducing health disparities among adults aged 50 and older. Building on our 15 years of experience conducting dissemination and implementation research aimed at scale-up of effective interventions, we plan to focus our work in three areas: cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion.  Specifically, we will expand the national reach of three flagship healthy-aging programs that were developed and tested by HPRC and disseminated by community organizations partnering with HPRC. First is EnhanceFitness, a group-exercise program for older adults. Since 1999, Senior Services, a Seattle-based non- profit organization serving older adults, has disseminated EnhanceFitness to more than 500 community sites in more than 30 states. It has reached more than 25,000 older adults, most of whom are low-income or members of racial and ethnic minorities. Second is PEARLS, a depression-management program delivered in community settings. Since 2003, Area Agencies on Aging have delivered PEARLS to more than 2,000 low-income, largely fragile and home-bound older adults with depression, through 45 sites in 14 states. Third is Workplace Solutions, a package of evidence-based cancer prevention practices for the workplace. Since 2003, the American Cancer Society has disseminated Workplace Solutions to more than 1,600 workplaces with 6.9 million employees in 42 states.  Scale-up of the EnhanceFitness program, with a focus on reducing race/ethnicity-related disparities in arthritis suffering, will be the objective of our Core Researh Project. In 2011, Senior Services licensed EnhanceFitness to YMCA of the USA (Y-USA), the national-network office for more than 2,700 YMCAs. Because EnhanceFitness decreases pain and increases mobility for persons with arthritis, Y-USA will focus its EnhanceFitness implementation on the half of older adults who suffer from arthritis. Older adults are much more likely to participate in a community-based program like EnhanceFitness if it is recommended by a health care provider, so Y-USA has asked for HPRC's help in enhancing its current, limited approach to increasing provider recommendations for EnhanceFitness participation. To do so, we will first conduct formative research with pharmacists and physical therapists to learn the most effective means of increasing recommendations to a community-based program like EnhanceFitness. Second, we will develop an enhanced approach tailored to obtaining recommendations by pharmacists, physical therapists, and primary-care providers for participation of older-adult arthritis patients in EnhanceFitness at YMCAs. Third, we will conduct a cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness and the cost of the current and enhanced approaches. HPRC's three healthy-aging focus areas - cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion - address many of the biggest health problems among middle- aged and older adults. Our research is aimed at national expansion of HPRC's three evidence-based healthy- aging programs: EnhanceFitness, which increases physical activity and preserves functioning; PEARLS, which reduces depression; and Workplace Solutions/HealthLinks, which increases employers' use of evidence-based practices to prevent chronic illnesses. These programs all have a record of success in reaching underserved, diverse populations at disparate risk for chronic diseases and related disability and mortality.",Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center,9135659,U48DP005013,[''],NCCDPHP,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U48,2015,314998,0.14100159479345614
"Social and Health Behaviors, and the Mediating Role of Treatment Engagement in Predicting Health Outcomes of Older Adults Living with HIV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diversity, its growth and complexity, are defining features of the dramatic aging of the world-wide population. Research demonstrates that older adults from disadvantaged populations are at elevated risk of poor health, disability and premature death. The National Institutes of Health are committed to reducing and eliminating health disparities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that health disparities related to sexual orientation are one of the main gaps in health disparities research. Existing evidence demonstrates that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) older adults are an at-risk, under-investigated and under-served health disparate population. This study will examine the determinants of health impacting LGB older adults to assess change in health and quality of life (QOL) over time. Based on an innovative resilience conceptual framework, the pro- posed longitudinal research will obtain data from 2,000 LGB older adults who participated in the original study in order to allow us to understand the inter-relationships between risk and protective factors as well as cohort effects as they impact health and QOL of LGB older adults over time. This multidisciplinary collaboration of University of Washington researchers and community-based collaborators addresses a critical gap by identifying modifiable mechanisms impacting health and QOL over time. The primary goals of the project are as follows: 1) Investigate how lifetime victimization, everyday discrimination, stress (perceived stress and physiological response to stress) and health behavior change affects health and QOL of LGB older adults over time; 2) Evaluate how social relations (time-varying) and sexual identity management (time-varying) affect the associations among everyday discrimination, stress, health and QOL over time; and, 3) Test whether there is cohort heterogeneity in overall levels and age growth trajectories of health and QOL, and to what extent the differences in experiences within a historical context (e.g., time of sexual identity disclosure, lifetime victimization) between Baby Boom and Silent Generation LGB older adults account for these cohort effects. As the population ages, the health care costs associated with health disparities will continue to rise. To respond to this growing public health challenge it is imperative to identfy groups at high risk of disparities and to determine the modifiable mechanisms impacting their health and QOL as they age. The findings from this project will generate needed information to directly inform and guide the development of tailored interventions that can be effectively delivered within community-based agency settings to improve the health and QOL of demographically diverse older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the population ages, the health care costs associated with health disparities continue to rise. To reduce health disparities it is imperative to identify grous at risk of disparities and to determine the modifiable factors impacting their health and quality o life. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) older adults have been identified as an at-risk, under-investigated, and under-served health disparate population. This longitudinal research will identify risk and protective mechanisms impacting the health and quality of life of LGB older adults, which will directly contribute to the development of tailored interventions to improve the health of demographically diverse older adults.","Social and Health Behaviors, and the Mediating Role of Treatment Engagement in Predicting Health Outcomes of Older Adults Living with HIV",9067112,R01AG026526,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Baby Booms ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Generation Effect ', ' Cohort Effect ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Housing ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Time Management ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Complex ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' peer ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Health behavior change ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' longitudinal design ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBTI ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,139873,0.18254866240054546
"Community Choirs to Promote Healthy Aging and Independence of Older Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The United States is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults. In 2009, there were 39.6 million individuals over age 65, and this number is expected to almost double by 2030. During the same time period, there will be an increase in the number of older adults with diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds who are at increased risk for poor health outcomes relative to non-minority elders. Thus, there is an immediate need to identify cost-effective, widely applicable, and sustainable programs that promote health and well-being of older adults. A growing body of literature suggests that participation in community choral singing may also have positive health benefits for older adults, but there is a need to evaluate the efficacy of a choral program for diverse older adults, and a well-designed randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to help strengthen the evidence base. Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to test the efficacy of community choir program for maintaining health and well-being in culturally diverse older adults. To address the aims of the study, we will evaluate a comprehensive set of outcomes that are hypothesized to be related to choral singing and complete a cost analysis. We will recruit 450 diverse older adults and will utilize 12 existing Administration on Aging-supported senior centers to implement a multi-site, randomized (by center) clinical trial (RCT). Centers will be randomized to receive the choir program immediately (intervention group) or after a 6-month delayed intervention phase (control group). The community choirs will be led by professional music directors. We will assess both primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 months (and 18 months for the delayed intervention group). We will also evaluate the start- up and ongoing program costs for senior centers, including cost/person served and determine quality adjusted life years. If successful, results from this RCT may help develop and further the premise that creative arts can be applied to helping solve national health priorities, such as keeping older adults active, independent, and involved in their communities in readily accessible, affordable, and sustainable ways. The United States is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, a group that is at increased risk of poor health relative to non-minorities.

"UCLA Older Americans Independence Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The UCLA Claude Pepper Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) is designed to promote research aimed at maintaining and restoring the independence of older persons. Through its theme of Preventing Disease and Disability in Vulnerable Populations: a Translational Approach, the UCLA OAlC's research extends across the full spectrum from Tl to T2 translational research. Within this theme, an important focus of the UCLA OAIC is on understanding the role of inflammation in disease and disability.    To accomplish its goals, the UCLA OAIC has established 4 Research Cores (Recruitment and Retention, Research Operations, Analysis and Cost Effectiveness, and Inflammatory Biology) and a new Information Dissemination Core that will facilitate OAlC-related research at every step (recruitment, measurement, data management, analysis, interpretation, and adoption of findings). Research cores provide support at 4 levels:   Consultation (e.g., providing up to several hours of advice, reading a paper or a proposal)   Partnership on new proposals   Short-term (e.g., up to 2-3 days of consultation, performing assays)   Ongoing or long-term support (e.g., ongoing, part of the project team)  In addition, the UCLA OAIC Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core and Research Career Development Core stimulate new research via a pipeline of junior investigators and pilot awards and recruit successful investigators into OAlC-related research. The Leadership/Administrative Core ensures that these specific activities are accomplished and the goals of the UCLA OAIC are optimally achieved.    The UCLA OAIC will address health disparities that vulnerable older persons face because of 1) inadequate understanding of contributors (e.g., socioeconomic status, inflammation) to health and specific illnesses (e.g., HIV, sleep, depression), 2) lack of effective preventive or therapeutc approaches (biomedical and behavioral), or 3) inadequate ability to get needed treatment to vulnerable older populations (e.g., cultural barriers, ineffective health care systems). By focusin efforts and resources through the OAIC, the timeline for research to develop, test, and disseminate promising innovations to maintain independence can be accelerated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the increasingly diverse sociodemographic profile of older Americans, including growing numbers of minorities and persons at risk because of chronic diseases, our understanding of the causes, prevention, and treatment of illness in these populations is particularly limited. To prevent the health disparities that persist into old age an increased risk for decline in these older vulnerable populations, research is needed on diseases and disorders, on what treatments work best for whom, and on how best to deliver health care.",UCLA Older Americans Independence Center,8901873,P30AG028748,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Anemia ', ' Award ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Capsicum ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Decision Making ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Demography ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Inflammation ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Operations Research ', ' Paper ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Reading ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sleep ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' ranpirnase ', ' Generations ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Uninsured ', ' TimeLine ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Hour ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' data management ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' TIM1 ', ' P60 ', ' GEF5 ', ' ARHGEF5 ', ' ARHGEF5 gene ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Population Research ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Older Population ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' translational approach ', ' successful intervention ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P30,2015,931860,0.08128022696574043
"End-of-Life in Assisted Living: Links between Structure, Process, and Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the demographic imperative of a rapidly aging population, a major challenge of the 21st century will be the growing prevalence of older adults who die from old age, most within the context of advanced chronic illness. Increasing numbers of these older adults will receive care and die in assisted living (AL), currently the fastest growing long-term care (LTC) option. The proposed five-year prospective qualitative study will investigate end-of-life (EOL) care in AL from the perspective of multiple stakeholders (residents, AL staff, informal caregivers, and external care providers, e.g., hospice workers). We will use a multifaceted multilevel conceptual framework and draw upon salient aspects of social ecological theory, Donabedian's structure- process-outcome (SPO) quality-of-care paradigm, relational theory, as well as domains of quality adapted from The National Consensus Project (NCP) Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care. The overall goal of the proposed research is to address critical knowledge gaps and identify best practices for EOL care in AL. The three specific aims are: (1) understand how EOL is defined and experienced by AL residents and other key stakeholders; (2) investigate the structure and process of formal and informal care in AL and understand the interface between these care components and how they shape outcomes; and (3) identify the contexts and conditions within which structures and processes of care are shaped and understand the combined impact these aspects of care have on stakeholders' overall EOL experience. Increasingly, LTC scholars and policy-makers are calling for a broader definition of EOL that encompasses different EOL transitions, including dying as a phase of advanced chronic illness that may extend for years, as well as dying at the end of old age. In order to provide adequate support services and timely palliative care, it is important to acknowledge and identify these varying and often ambiguous EOL trajectories. Following the Institute of Medicine, we define the EOL experience broadly to include periods of decline associated with advanced age or chronic illness where the timing of death is uncertain. To investigate the EOL process as it unfolds over time, we will use grounded theory methods to study eight diverse AL settings in Georgia that vary according to size (6-15 beds; 16-24 beds; 25-50 beds; and 51+ beds), resident and staff profile, rural/urban location, ownership, licensing status, and resources. The study will include low-income, rural, and racial/ethnic minority residents, groups typically excluded from AL research, as well as residents living in dementia units. Data collection in each home will extend over two years and include: 271 in-depth interviews, informal interviewing, review of focal residents' social and health records, and participant observation. The proposed study will identify modifiable factors associated with adverse EOL experiences and potential disparities in care that can be targets of intervention at multiple ecological levels and contribute to ongoing efforts to transform and improve the quality of EOL care for older adults in LTC and other care settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed five-year prospective qualitative study investigates end-of- life (EOL) care in Georgia assisted living (AL) facilities. Such research is crucial given the growing use of AL, the increasing frailty and diversity of the AL population, and the rising number of deaths reported in AL each year. This study, which is the first to date to focus on EOL care in AL in depth, will offer valuable insights to researchers, policy-makers, and service providers.            ","End-of-Life in Assisted Living: Links between Structure, Process, and Outcomes",8818409,R01AG047408,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Beds ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospices ', ' hospice environment ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' living will ', ' Living Wills ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ownership ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Societies ', ' Terminally Ill ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Licensing ', ' Shapes ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' frailty ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' health record ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Process ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,400494,0.058129670255206156
"Peer Empowerment Program for Physical Activity in Low Income & Minority Seniors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peer Empowerment Program for Physical Activity in Low Income & Minority Seniors Older adults are the least active population group in the US. Yet, research has shown that an increase in physical activity (PA) can have immediate and profound effects on cardiovascular health. Older adults who are active use significantly fewer health care resources, and with the increasing number of older adults in the US it is imperative to curb health care expenditure in this group. Many PA interventions are flawed because they focus on individual motivations and ignore variations in community resources, neighborhood walkability, and safety. Low income and ethnically diverse communities have disproportionately fewer resources and less supportive neighborhoods. This contributes to lower PA levels and health disparities in obesity, diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. National and international health institutions have called for community based PA programs to improve population health. Senior centers are an ideal setting for PA interventions because they serve a large number of older adults and there are funding mechanisms for delivery of evidence based programs. While there are multiple benefits of different PA programs, national guidelines for PA still emphasize aerobic activity. Senior Centers currently offer group based PA programs but our preliminary studies show that 1) low income, ethnically diverse older adults attending such centers are not meeting PA guidelines, 2) evidence based programs in such centers do not generate moderate intensity PA, 3) they do not provide behavioral strategies to support more frequent and independent PA and 4) members are not involved in the delivery of such programs which may increase engagement and sustainability. We propose to build upon our NHLBI R01 funded PA program that increased aerobic activity in retirement community residents. The program was delivered by UCSD health educators for 6 months with the help of peer leaders who then sustained it over 12 months. To improve upon this work, we propose a train the trainer model with a greater focus on empowering the peer leaders, center staff and participants to self-monitor, self-organize and advocate for additional resources from the start. Since our aim is to test a PA program that can be adopted by local area aging agencies with Older Americans Act Title IIID funds, we will employ an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design; which allows for the concurrent testing of both intervention and implementation strategies and outcomes. We will also extend program monitoring to 24 months. Thus, in a 2-year cluster randomized controlled field trial of 408 ethnically diverse, older adults (50+ years old) in 12 low income Senior Centers in San Diego County we will investigate the efficacy of PEP4PA (Peer Empowerment Program 4 Physical Activity) to reduce disparities in PA by increasing the percentage of participants achieving 150 minutes of PA per week and to improve physical functioning & fitness, blood pressure, depressive symptoms and quality of life at 6, 12 & 24 months. We will assess the incremental cost effectiveness ratio of PEP4PA in terms of cost per MET hour and cost per QALY compared to usual programming in the control centers at 12 & 24 months.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older adults are the least active population group in the US. Disparities by income exist for key diseases related to physical activity (PA). This study will reduce disparities in PA by empowering older adults in low income senior centers to deliver a PA program that is sustainable and addresses neighborhood barriers.            ",Peer Empowerment Program for Physical Activity in Low Income & Minority Seniors,8797221,R01HL125405,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Aerobic Exercise ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hybrids ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Motivation ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Physical Fitness ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Safety ', ' Sleep ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' hypertensive heart disorder ', ' hypertensive cardiomyopathy ', ' heart hypertension ', ' heart disorder hypertension ', ' heart disease hypertension ', ' cardiac hypertension ', ' hypertensive heart disease ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' sedentary ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Route ', ' Physical Function ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' instructor ', ' empowered ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Health Educators ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Group ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Evidence based program ', ' volunteer ', ' loss of function ', ' functional loss ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' population health ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,774270,0.05918426176134796
"Emergency Department Identification and Care of Suicidal Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA) continue to be a serious concern among older adults, with depression affecting an estimated 7% of all adults over age 65 years (11) and the highest worldwide suicide rates documented for older men.(3,7) Suicide prevention for older adults has unique challenges because older suicidal individuals are more likely to use advance planning and less likely to ask for help.(9) Prior work has suggested that clinicians may under-diagnose or under-treat depression and SI among older adults.(21-22) Early recognition and treatment of depression, as well as improved management of chronic health conditions, can make a difference among older adults by improving quality of life and reducing morbidity and mortality.(25) There is evidence that targeted interventions in primary care settings can improve rates of screening and treatment for depression (41), but very little is known about SI/SA among older emergency department (ED) patients, who may be at increased risk compared to the general population because of comorbidities (32) and acute physical (32) or psychosocial (33) stresses. While some EDs are moving towards universal screening for SI/SA, most still rely on targeted questioning triggered by clinician concern. Understanding which older ED patients may be suicidal could help clinicians more easily identify this high-risk group, and understanding current patterns of treatment-including identification of disparities in care between older and younger patients with SI/SA-could help improve ED care. The overall goal of this research is to lay the groundwork for the development of effective ED-based interventions for suicide prevention by better describing the population of older ED patients with self-harm/SI/SA. For our first specific aim, we use the large database from a multi-site trial of universal ED screening for SI/SA (""Emergency Department Safety Assessment and Follow-up Evaluation,"" ED-SAFE) to provide an estimate of the prevalence of SI/SA among older ED patients, including variations among age groups. For our second specific aim, we will conduct a more detailed retrospective chart review at one ED to describe the patient characteristics and ED treatment of older ED patients with SI/SA, including possible disparities in care. The findings from this research proposal will provide the essential scientific foundation for future design and implementation of evidence-based interventions to improve ED recognition and care of older adults with suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Such interventions have the potential to improve the quality of life of older adults with mental illness and to prevent premature death from suicide.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicide are common among older adults and have significant negative effects on physical health, well-being, morbidity and mortality. Age-adjusted suicide rates are highest among older men, and suicide prevention can be difficult in this age group because older adults are more likely to use lethal methods and advance planning and are less likely to ask for help. Unfortunately, medical providers may under-recognize the signs of depression or suicidality among older adults and therefore miss opportunities for intervention. Emergency departments (EDs) care for large volumes of older patients, but very little is known about suicidal thoughts or behaviors among older ED patients. In order to develop effective suicide prevention approaches for older ED patients, it is important we understand the magnitude of the problem (prevalence of suicidal thoughts or behaviors among older patients), patient characteristics associated with suicidal thoughts or behaviors (to help clinicians identify these high-risk patients), and current patterns f care of older and younger patients with suicidal thoughts or behaviors (to identify and address age-based disparities in care).                ",Emergency Department Identification and Care of Suicidal Older Adults,8948169,R03MH107551,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Engagement in Care of Older, Rural HIV+ Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION: HIV-positive adults who live in rural areas suffer from greater mortality than non-rural HIV-infected individuals and face unique challenges to maintaining good health. This disparity in health outcomes is not well understood, yet remains significant because a sizeable number of HIV-positive individuals live in rural areas. To minimize morbidity and mortality, all HIV-positive individuals must remain engaged in care and adherent to antiretroviral medications over the course of their lives. Services such as expert HIV care, case management, mental health care, and antiretroviral adherence support can improve health outcomes for HIV-infected individuals, but may be unavailable or more difficult to access for individuals living in rural ares. Additional factors challenge rural HIV-infected individuals, including transportation, social isolation, increased stigma, higher rates of depression, and more maladaptive coping mechanisms. As the HIV population in the US ages-more than half of HIV-infected individuals in the US will be over age 50 by 2015-access to medical care and ancillary services will become increasingly important to maintain good health outcomes. While the individual sets of challenges of aging with HIV and living with HIV in a rural environment are each significant, older HIV-positive individuals who live in rural areas face a doubly difficult set of challenges to achieving good health outcomes. Currently, little is known about the factors that affect (1) engagement in HIV-related care, and (2) health-related quality of life among older, rural HIV-positive adults. This project will elucidate the unique personal, social, and structural factors tht affect health-related quality of life and engagement in medical care among older, rural HIV-positive adults and determine the effect of these factors on health outcomes. To accomplish these goals, this project will use a mixed-methods approach. During the formative, qualitative phase of the study, in-depth individual interviews will be conducted with approximately 40 HIV-positive adults over the age of 50 who live in rural areas of the US. These interviews will elucidate the personal, psychosocial, medical, structural, geographic, and demographic factors that affect perceived quality of life as well as engagement in medical care. Using data from the formative phase of the study, a survey will be constructed to measure (1) the prevalence of each factor in a large sample; (2) which factors are associated with engagement in medical care and quality of life; and (3) the degree to which each factor is associated with these outcomes. During this phase of the study, 400 HIV-positive adults over age 50 who live in rural areas throughout the US will complete this survey. Analyses of survey data will determine the specific needs of this population, and the factors that have the greatest effect on quality of life and engagement in medical care. This project will yield data which is of great public health significance, as it will demonstrate the current needs of this population of US HIV-positive individuals that suffer from greater mortality and will serve as a basis from which to develop interventions to improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities for this population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than half of the US HIV population will be over age 50 by 2015. Maintaining engagement in HIV medical care is critical, yet challenging for individuals aging with HIV. Older HIV-infected individuals who live in rural areas face even greater challenges to staying engaged in medical care and suffer higher rates of mortality than urban individuals. This project will yield data that will demonstrate the personal, social, and structura needs of older, rural HIV-positive individuals and will serve as a basis from which to develop interventions to improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities for this population.             ","Engagement in Care of Older, Rural HIV+ Adults",8902703,R21AG048675,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Social isolation ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Transportation ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Case Management ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Managed Care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dependence ', ' Perceived quality of life ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' coping mechanism ', ' ancillary care ', ' ']",NIA,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2015,191250,0.028808903327125327
"Health IT decision support to improve medication management safety and quality DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For older adults, polypharmacy is a major safety issue with serious economic implications. Dr. Gerardo Moreno proposes research needed to investigate the use of health information technology (HIT) to improve medication management decision making for older adults in community health centers. The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award will provide Dr. Moreno, a family medicine physician from UCLA, the resources to focus his research on aging and to obtain additional research training needed to become an independent principal investigator. The detailed research and career development experiences proposed aim to build upon his existing research skill set to gain needed expertise to: 1) develop his independence as a productive principal investigator in the area of Latino aging health disparities; 2) further focus his research and gain significant expertise in aging-related issues; and 3) expand his qualitative research skills and implementation science skills. To achieve these goals, Dr. Moreno will complete course work, directed reading tutorials, and practical research experience. The career development activities also include mentorship and resources from the UCLA Resource Center for Minority Aging Research, a program devoted to eliminating disparities in health and health care among minority elders and to developing minority faculty who will be independently funded investigators who conduct aging research. Dr. Moreno's multidisciplinary mentorship team includes a health services researcher, social scientist, health informatics researcher, statistician with formal computer science training, and geriatrician. This proposal will use principles of community-based participatory research to build upon an established 4 year academic-community research partnership developed by the applicant with a large rural community health center.            For older adults with multiple chronic conditions, polypharmacy can lead to increased use of potentially inappropriate medications and at the same time to the underutilization of medications known to improve health outcomes. Health (IT) tools may improve decision making for medication management but we know little about their application in community health centers and other safety-net settings. An overall objective of this proposal is to enhance Dr. Moreno's research skills and to conduct preliminary studies needed to develop health IT point-of-care (POC) decision support tailored to the prescription drug management needs of older adults in a safety-net system. Health IT POC clinical decision support in community health centers can be adopted by clinicians and hold great promise for improving the safety and quality of medication management for older adults when the end users of the system are incorporated into the research process from start to finish. Therefore, Dr. Moreno proposes research in partnership with a large rural community/migrant health center in California's impoverished San Joaquin Valley that serves two counties and has 22 clinical sites. His community partner's patient population is 72 percent Latino which is significant given the current and projected increase of elderly Latinos over the next few decades. To this end, the specific aims that focus on adults � 60 years of age are: 1) to examine the prevalence and correlates of use of potentially inappropriate medications, 2) to examine how often there is suboptimal medication intensification of needed treatments for those with hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemias, 3) to identify provider, patient, and stakeholder barriers and facilitators (e.g. work flow issues and tailoring of message) to adoption of patient-centered health IT POC decision support designed to improve prescription drug management and safety, and 4) to adapt and develop a prototype of health IT POC decision support system for prescription drug management tailored to older adults with cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemias. Aims 1-3 will inform the development and the decision support content and targeted messaging that is proposed in Aim 4. This research forms the basis for an R01 application of an adequately powered randomized clinical trial of health IT POC decision support to improve medication management quality and safety for older adults across a regional community clinic network. Older adults are at increased risk of using potentially inappropriate medications and paradoxically of under using treatments known to improve control of cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure. Health information technology (HIT) decision support to improve medication management delivered electronically during the patient visit holds great potential for decreasing use of potentially inappropriate medications and increasing the use of beneficial treatments. This project is grounded in an established community-based approach that will systematically include feedback from physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and patients so that the medication decision support tools developed are widely accepted and address the most important barriers for safe prescribing for older adults with chronic conditions.",Health IT decision support to improve medication management safety and quality,8901888,K23AG042961,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Decision Making ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Faculty ', ' family medicine ', ' Family Practice ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' Nurses ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Physicians ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Rural Community ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Medication Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Safety Management ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' career development ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' one year old ', ' age 1 year ', ' 1 year old ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Health Informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' effectiveness research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' safety net ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' stem ', ' community based participatory research ', ' implementation science ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' hypertension control ', ' health information technology ', ' economic implication ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2015,137548,0.08910945002387974
"Communities Designed to Support Cardiovascular Health for Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Business establishments have the potential to shape individual behaviors including dietary intake, physical activity patterns, and management of chronic medical conditions, all with relevance to risk of myocardial infarction and related cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Policy strategies targeting local businesses may play an important role in CVD prevention, extending years of healthy life, and facilitating independent living. We propose to bring together commercially available ""big data"" and detailed population-based cohort data to examine the role of local business environments in CVD and racial disparities in CVD as they emerged across decades. Longitudinal studies of local environments have been strongly recommended as a direction for future research to advance our understanding of causal neighborhood effects on health. The local density of businesses with potential relevance to CVD has changed over time, and such temporal fluctuations vary across regions, cities and neighborhoods. These differences can be used to investigate how residentially stable older adults are affected by their local context. Meanwhile, older adults who relocate to a new home address may respond to their new context by changing health behaviors, offering another window into causation. However, careful attention is needed to acute health changes that precipitate relocation, and which local environment features predict aging in place despite new health or functional limitations. In the proposed project, we will link longitudinal data to investigate how neighborhood change and residential relocation shape cardiovascular health and health disparities. We will use a census of national businesses, the National Establishment Time Series (NETS). NETS data for all 52.4 million US business establishments includes annual point-level geocodes and business characteristics for the years 1990-2012, offering an unprecedented opportunity to characterize changing business environments nationally at multiple spatial scales. Geographic context data (from NETS as well as longitudinal population, safety, and transportation data) will be linked to individual data from two ongoing cohort studies: the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study. CHS is a well-characterized population- based study of 5,888 older adults (100% age 65+ at baseline, 58% female, 16% African American). A majority of the CHS participants enrolled 1990-1993 from four US sites, with         oversampling of African Americans, have been followed prospectively for the remainder of their lives, allowing in-depth characterization of neighborhood environments experienced by older adults in their final decades. REGARDS is also a prospective population-based cohort study with oversampling of African Americans, allowing for examination of racial disparities. However, the 30,239 REGARDS participants (49% age 65+ at baseline, 55% female, 42% African American) were enrolled more recently (2003-2007) and from a broader geographic region (48 contiguous US states, oversampling Stroke Belt residents). For these two cohorts with complementary strengths, cardiovascular events have been ascertained and longitudinal address data collected. This project brings together unparalleled data resources, builds on a track record of policy-relevant work with large geographic data resources, and leverages comprehensive cardiovascular cohort data.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Businesses represent sources of food, walking destinations, and opportunities to access medical care. These aspects of the local environment have the potential to support healthy lifestyles, heart health, and independent living for an aging population. Following recommendations to study how neighborhood change affects health, this project brings together (1) unparalleled neighborhood data on all 52.4 million US businesses from 1990-2012, (2) detailed data on health of 36,127 adults over time from two cohort studies, and (3) an interdisciplinary research team with a track record of conducting and disseminating policy-relevant science.

"Cohort differences in social life and health:  Refreshing the NSHAP sample DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP) is a longitudinal study of older adults designed to examine the mechanisms by which social factors-such as intimate relationships and social networks-affect and are affected by health. In 2005-06, questionnaire and biomeasure data were collected from a nationally- representative sample of 3,005 community-dwelling adults ages 57-85 (W1). These referent respondents were reinterviewed in 2010-11, together with coresident spouses/partners (W2). A third wave (W3), to be collected in 2015-16, will reinterview all surviving referent respondents and W2 spouses/partners. Collectively, NSHAP's W1, W2 and W3 provide extensive, longitudinal, health and social information for a nationally representative sample of older adults. We aim to add a new cohort to the NSHAP sample to capture the unique and epidemiologically intriguing ""Baby Boom"" cohort. Funding for refreshing the sample with a new cohort of aging ""Baby Boomers"" (i.e., respondents born from 1948 through 1965) will substantially increase the value of NSHAP for various research communities, opening up key avenues for conducting innovative and effective health related research, such as: (1) comparing the social connections, networks, environment and relationships of older adults in different birth cohorts and the relationship of these social factors with health; (2) tracing cohort differences in the life courseof cohabitations and marital relationships; (3) comparing trajectories of physical function, self-rate health, health behaviors, prevalence of chronic diseases, and physiological functioning across ages over birth cohorts; (4) tracking the transition from middle-age to older ages; and (5) capturing racial and ethnic differences in the ages at which relevant chronic conditions become prevalent across cohorts.  Funding will support adding over 2,500 respondents. The addition of respondents ages 50 to 67 in 2015- 16 will provide a nationally-representative, high-quality data set on social relationships and health for ages 50 to 95, setting the stage for a sequential cohort design. The addition of the Baby Boom cohort will allow researchers to compare health and social outcomes along age, period, and cohort axes. We will harmonize data collection with W3 of NSHAP to form a single, cohesive dataset, including in-home interviews with 1,600 new respondents born between 1948-1965 and their spouses or co-residential romantic partners (n=900). This will yield extensive, nationally representative, self-reported and biomeasure data on multiple cohorts' physical and mental health, physical and cognitive functioning, medication use, and pathways of health and mortality within social contexts, facilitating comparative assessments of health disparities between gender, race, ethnicity and socio- economic status by age within and across cohorts.

"Suicide Prevention in Chinese Older Adults This two-site (Rush University and Northwestern University) linked re-submission of R34MH100443 collaborative application aims to design a culturally tailored and communityengaged intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts in US Chinese older adults, who have the highest suicide rate than any other racial/ethnic groups. Despite this health disparity, we have great paucity in our understanding of cultural issues surrounding suicide in Chinese populations, and this has directly hampered the intervention efforts. Accordingly, we seek to support a geriatrician (Dong) with expertise in aging, mental health and Chinese culture, and an interventionist (Simon) with expertise in clinical trials using community health workers to reduce health disparities among minority populations. More specifically, we aim to 1) expand synergistic academic and community partnerships; 2) iteratively design and refine a culturally meaningful pilot intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts; 3) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial; and 4) rigorously evaluate the cultural acceptability of the proposed intervention at multiple levels. This study will set the cornerstone for the next R01 application to fully test the efficacy of a culturally tailored intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts in Chinese aging populations.    By 2030, Chinese older adults will account for a quarter of the world's aging populations. Despite the rapid growth of Chinese populations in the US, there are marked health disparities among Chinese older adults, which are further exacerbated by the complex linguistic and cultural nuances in studying Chinese populations, particularly on issues of suicidal thoughts. Moreover, there has been inadequate and sustainable community support necessary to empower the Chinese community to be fully engaged as equal partners in research. In this application, a bilingual and bicultural principal investigator and an interdisciplinary investigative team have leveraged the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR), building on our prior NIH funded CBPR projects to partner synergistically and sustainably with the Chicago Chinese community in order to overcome these challenges and set the foundation for this proposal. The study findings will inform clinicians, investigators, communities, social services and policy makers to: a) improve our in-depth understanding of cultural issues surrounding suicide; b) empower community to be equal partners in mental health research ; c) guide the next R01 intervention study; and d) inform practice and policy on suicide care in Chinese older adults. Public Health Relevance:  This R34 resubmission will collaborative and iteratively design and refine a culturally adapted intervention to reduce the frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts in Chinese older adults. This has implication for investigators, clinicians, community, social services and policy makers to reduce suicide in Chinese older adults. This two-site (Rush University and Northwestern University) linked re-submission of R34MH100443 collaborative application aims to design a culturally tailored and communityengaged intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts in US Chinese older adults, who have the highest suicide rate than any other racial/ethnic groups. Despite this health disparity, we have great paucity in our understanding of cultural issues surrounding suicide in Chinese populations, and this has directly hampered the intervention efforts. Accordingly, we seek to support a geriatrician (Dong) with expertise in aging, mental health and Chinese culture, and an interventionist (Simon) with expertise in clinical trials using community health workers to reduce health disparities among minority populations. More specifically, we aim to 1) expand synergistic academic and community partnerships; 2) iteratively design and refine a culturally meaningful pilot intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts; 3) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial; and 4) rigorously evaluate the cultural acceptability of the proposed intervention at multiple levels.

"Disparities in Avoidable Hospitalizations of Aging Adults-Health System Factors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research shows that timely access to high quality ambulatory care has been a persistent problem in the U.S. health care system. Studies have estimated, for example, that in 2006 nearly $31 billion was spent on 4.4 million ambulatory care sensitive hospitalizations (ACSH), accounting for nearly 10 percent of total hospital expenditures and nearly 1 in 5 Medicare admissions. High rates of potentially avoidable ACSH are a serious challenge for the U.S. health care system because they often reflect unnecessary, poor quality care with significant cost implications for a resource constrained system, especially among vulnerable populations, such as minorities and the elderly. The focus on improving access to care coincides with another trend in health care - the expectation that hospitals will adopt and utilize principles of population health management to better serve the communities they serve. Prior research, however, has not examined how hospitals have responded to increasing pressure to adopt these practices and whether their adoption has any impact on access to and quality of ambulatory care in local communities in ways that may reduce potentially avoidable utilization. Our study will address the following aims: 1: To examine the changes in two indicators of hospitals' population health activities - community orientation and health promotion services - over time and assess whether these changes vary as a function of different types of hospitals. 2: To explore whether changes in community orientation and health promotion services are differentially associated with potentially avoidable ACSH rates for different racial/ethnic groups among older adults. 3: To analyze whether the relationship between community orientation, potentially avoidable ACSH rates is mediated by the level of health promotion and whether this mediational influence differs for different racial/ethnic groups among older adults. 4: Strengthen the capacity of the Department of Health Services Administration (HSA) to conduct high-impact research on health services for minority aging through mentoring of undergraduate and graduate faculty and students. The study will use linear growth curve models to examine changes (2009-2012) in hospital adoption of community orientation and health promotion activities and assess whether these changes are differentially associated with rates of chronic ACSH for different racial/ethnic groups. The analytic sample for the quantitative analysis consists of ACSH for older adults (55 and older) in six states: California, Florida, Michigan, New York, South Carolina, and Texas. The proposed study will help illuminate the effects of current policies designed to reduce avoidable inpatient care. Our study also promotes understanding of hospital and community factors that may contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in unnecessary ACSH, which addresses an important gap in the literature. The project will provide the opportunity to engage undergraduate and graduate faculty and students in the conduct of high- quality research on health services for minority aging, thereby helping to build the HSA research capacity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will help illuminate the effects of current policies designed to reduce avoidable inpatient care.

"Urinary Dysfunction in the Elderly: Informing Accountable Urologic Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to foster the applicant's transition to aging research by combining the analytic, clinical and mentoring capabilities of our group. The proposed research will explore care delivery for older men and women with overactive bladder, with or without urinary incontinence. The results of the proposed investigation will potentially reduce health care disparities, identify opportunities to improve quality of care, and foster a paradigm shift in care delivery by informing design of coordinated care models. The overall aims of this project are: 1) to describe patient- and provider- level variation in pharmacologic intervention for older adults with overactive bladder symptoms; and, 2) to empirically identify patient and provider factors associated with treatment intensity, controlling for important clinica covariates such as incontinence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Overactive bladder disproportionately affects older adults, with a prevalence reaching as high as 50% among those aged at least 76 years; at its most severe, the symptom complex includes urge urinary incontinence, characterized by unpredictable, embarrassing, large-volume urine loss. National costs for treating patients with overactive bladder symptoms are projected to exceed $82 billion by 2020. The project's proposed examination of variation in prescribing patterns and treatment intensity for overactive bladder will broadly inform policy makers and health system leaders interested in reducing health care disparities, improving quality of care, and designing coordinated care models for the treatment of older patients with overactive bladder.",Urinary Dysfunction in the Elderly: Informing Accountable Urologic Care,8918406,R03AG048130,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Constipation ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' General Practitioners ', ' Generalists ', ' Gynecology ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' health services for seniors ', ' health services for older people ', ' health services for older adults ', ' Health Services for the Elderly ', ' Geriatric Health Services ', ' Health Services for the Aged ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incontinence ', ' Infection ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Nycturia ', ' Nocturia ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Testing ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Urinary tract ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Urology ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' urination urgency ', ' urinary urgency ', ' Urgent desire to urinate ', ' Urgency to pass urine ', ' micturition urgency ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' Urge Incontinence ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' urological ', ' urologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Anticholinergics ', ' Anticholinergic Agents ', ' Anti-Cholinergics ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' payment ', ' economic cost ', ' Lower urinary tract ', ' Modeling ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Overactive Bladder ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Characteristics ', ' urinary ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' economic outcome ', ' Medicare claim ', ' ']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R03,2015,114217,0.08542363472880984
"Built Environment and Health Care Use: Disparities Among Chronically Ill Elders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Associations between characteristics of the neighborhoods in which older people live and late-life disparities in chronic illness have been the subject of a rapidly growing field of research. For low-income and minority elders with chronic illness, disparities in access to and quality of care contribute to disparities in the burden of illness. Research on chronic illness has also underscored the links between inadequate physician oversight, potentially preventable hospitalizations, and poor health outcomes. However, little is known about the ways in which neighborhood environmental factors - beyond local supply of medical services - inform how urban older adults with chronic illness use physician services to manage their health. This study addresses this gap by examining the relationships between neighborhood built environment (e.g. walk-ability, access to public transit), use of physician services, and preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits among elderly, chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries who live in New York City. Specifically, the study aims to:  1) Examine associations between neighborhood built environment and physician service use among  urban, chronically ill older adults;  2) Determine whether and to what extent variations in the built environment influence potentially  preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits; and  3) Reassess findings from Aims 1 and 2 by applying: (i) alternative modeling techniques; and (ii) tests of  endogeneity to address the potential sorting of patients into neighborhoods with different characteristics  based on service use and outcomes.  The study will be based on longitudinal analysis of existing data on a sample of NYC-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older, linking individual characteristics and service use measures with small area- level data from other sources. Analyses will focus on patients with congestive heart failure and diabetes - two major contributors to preventable hospitalizations. This study will provide insight into the interdependence of clinical, social, economic, and environmental factors that influence quality of chronic illness care and, ultimately, quality of life, for older adults with multiple co-morbidities. The proposed research will apply and expand on the candidate's training throughout the K01 award period, including advanced methodological training in epidemiology and health economics. The training and research activities will lay the foundation for an R01 application in the later years of the award. Findings from this study and future research will ultimately be applied toward developing effective interventions to improve access to, continuity, and quality of ambulatory care for chronically ill elders living in underserved communities and, in turn, mitigate late-life health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant socio-economic and racial/ethnic disparities exist in the burden of chronic illness among older adults, due partly to disparities in access to and quality of ambulatory care aimed at preventing chronic illness complications. Although prior research has examined geographic variations in health care access across areas such as counties, little is known about how variations in environmental and socio-economic factors at the neighborhood level influence disparities in service use and outcomes among vulnerable groups, particularly low-income and minority elders. This study aims to address this gap by examining the relationships between neighborhood built environment, use of physician services, and preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits among elderly, chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries who live in New York City.",Built Environment and Health Care Use: Disparities Among Chronically Ill Elders,8865514,K01AG039463,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Award ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Catchment Area (Health) ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' Transportation ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' Services ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' social ', ' medical supply ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' beneficiary ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' demographics ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' effective intervention ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,K01,2015,108994,0.00400776226366246
"Racial Disparities in Mobility Disablility Among Older Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to continue the National Health and Aging Trend Study (NHATS), which aims (1) to promote scientific inquiry into late-life disability trends and dynamics, their antecedents and correlates, and disparities therein and (2) to advance study of the social and economic consequences of late-life disability for individuals, families, and society. To achieve these aims, in the next 5-year cycle (2014-2018) we will: (a) Collect data in person from the original NHATS cohort annually, including: continued collection of the enhanced disability protocol and supplemental questions on consequences including subjective and economic wellbeing, living and care arrangements, and quality of end of life; collection of dried blood spots, some to be assayed to foster study of the biologic risk for disability progression, and others to be stored for future use; enhancements to the NHATS interview in key understudied areas of potentially growing importance-use of rehabilitation services aimed at recovery from disability, and the service environment and related amenities that promote independent functioning in retirement and senior community settings-and incorporating new modules submitted by the broader research community. (b) Replenish the sample in Round 5 (2015). Replenishment will be implemented in such a way that NHATS maintains the ability to produce 5-year age estimates (including 90+) and Black-White comparisons. (c) Clean, document and disseminate public use files online and continue to make Medicare claims and other sensitive and restricted files available using established procedures. (d) Undertake methodological studies to improve the efficiency of data collection in future rounds, including testing the sensitivity of key estimates to differential follow-up periods and applying modern measurement approaches such as Item Response Theory (IRT) to measures of capacity. The overarching goal of NHATS is to be a platform for scientific inquiry to guide efforts to reduce disability, maximize functioning, and enhance older adults' quality of life. Research using NHATS will foster research to design multi-factor interventions to reduce late-life disability, and will support comprehensive modeling of outcomes of the disability process including living and care arrangements, expenditures, economic well-being, and quality of life.

"Health Care Partners in Cancer Prevention and Care Among Aged - Competing Renewal DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We plan to implement a novel, community based educational program to inform and motivate underserved older adults to forge partnerships with their doctors, targeting cancer prevention as a shared goal. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will evaluate the efficacy of our social learning theory based intervention that promotes patient participation in order to enhance patient centered medical care. This study builds on findings of our ongoing study of Health Care Partnerships in Cancer Prevention and Care. Specifically we propose a multi-modal health communication training program for older adults. This educational intervention (""Speak Up"" program), aims to improve patient initiative, competence, and confidence in communication with physicians. Based on foundations of social learning theory the intervention is expected to result in increased discussion between older adults and their primary care physicians about cancer prevention and screening. Participants in the intervention are also expected to receive more age and risk specific preventive advice from their doctors and report greater satisfaction with their health care. Participants in the ""Speak Up"" facilitated discussion groups (N=480) will be compared to participants in ""Connect"" attention control groups (N=480). The latter program addresses important goals of enhancing civic and social engagement. The intervention program will be conducted in small groups and offer user-friendly experiential learning including information, discussion, and role play in order to help older persons develop better communication skills. The study will be conducted among randomly selected community dwelling elders who had participated in our prior research, and among community based older adults who attend Senior Center nutrition programs, sponsored by Area Agencies on Aging (AAA). Based on comparing pre-intervention assessments with 2 week, 6 month, and 12 month telephone follow-up evaluations, we will determine both the short term and long term impact of the intervention. We will consider participants' personal characteristics and their physicians' background and supportiveness as they may influence uptake of the intervention. We designed the study based on intervention research (CONSORT) guidelines for conducting RCTs, and will carefully evaluate treatment fidelity. In addition to patient reported outcomes, we will also consider objective indices based on Medicare claims data and AAA data on program utilization. We will use multilevel models with fixed and random effects in our quantitative data analyses. Using a mixed methods design, we will also include a qualitative study component based on in-depth interviews with 60 participants selected based on high versus low program benefits. Our study is closely aligned with the mission of the National Cancer Institute to improve cancer control and to reduce health disparities in cancer prevention and care. We plan an active dissemination effort to insure that this portable and cost effective intervention may be widely adopted by community organizations such as Area Agencies on Aging that serve diverse older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study has direct relevance to public health. Our goal is to improve older patients' advocacy skills and their ability to communicate with their physicians regarding cancer prevention and general medical care. We expect that the confidence and initiative they will acquire as a result of our intervention will result in improvements in the preventive care they will receive.

"Effects of Employment on Health and Quality of Life in Older Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People over 65 years old (65+) are the fastest growing group in the US population, and workers 65+ are increasing in number much more rapidly than any other worker age group. By year 2012, workers 65+ are estimated to comprise 16.7% of US labor force. This group of elderly workers is highly diverse (e.g. racial/ethnic and socio-economic status composition), yet their health status is only beginning to be characterized. Furthermore, careful examination of health-related quality of life of the older worker has been virtually ignored by the occupational health/aging research community. Finally, there has been no systematic research into variations in healthcare costs and utilization in this population, despite systemic concern over rising healthcare costs in the United States. This study proposes to use the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to study the health status, medical expenditures, healthcare utilization, and quality of life of employed older adults. Both datasets contain large representative samples of US adults 65+ (n=386,887 and n=17,396). Both descriptive and analytic modeling are proposed within a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework, taking into account socio-economic determinants of health such as occupational segregation and occupational prestige. The study proposes to:1) characterize health disparities, morbidity, health behaviors and conditions, and health-related quality of life of US workers and non-workers 65+ stratified by age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, health insurance, occupational segregation and prestige, employment status and occupational/industry categories; 2) using SEM, identify sociodemographic and occupational factors (including occupational prestige and segregation) associated with healthcare utilization and expenditures by workers 65+ after adjustment for health behavior, morbidity and health conditions; and 3) using SEM, predict the health- related quality of life in sub-populations of workers 65+ after adjustment for health behavior, morbidity and health conditions. This study is relevant to four out of five National Institute on Aging (NIA) research goals, including: (1) understanding of disease and disability in older adults; (2) aiding in developing interventions to improve their health and quality of life; (3) understanding the implications of an aging society; and (4) identification of health disparities and interventions to decrease these disparities. The findings of the proposed study can be used by policy makers, employers, and other stakeholders to make health-related and employment-related decisions and implement workplace changes and health promotion programs targeting the senior community in order to improve well-being and quality of life of people 65+. Adults over 65 years old who remain employed past retirement age constitute a rapidly growing and a highly diverse proportion of US older adults, however their health status, healthcare expenditures, and quality of life are only beginning to be characterized. Using innovative advanced statistical techniques this proposal will describe current older worker socio-demographics characteristics, health status, as well as study linkages between occupational status and occupation on one hand, and health status, healthcare utilization and expenditures, and health-related quality of life on the other.",Effects of Employment on Health and Quality of Life in Older Adults,8882212,F30AG040886,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Medical Education ', ' Employment ', ' Occupational Status ', ' Expenditure ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospitalization ', ' indexing ', ' Industry ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Labor Forces ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Occupational Groups ', ' United States National Academy of Sciences ', ' National Academy of Sciences ', ' National Academy of Sciences (U.S.) ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Retirement ', ' Social Class ', ' Societies ', ' statistics ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Employment Status ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' Occupational ', ' Equation ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Stratification ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,F30,2015,44300,0.05210322672499083
"Maximizing the Impact of ePHIM in Low-Income, Multiethnic Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to access, manage, and understand personal health information enables individuals to become  better consumers and participate more fully in making health care decisions.  The development of electronic health records and the availability of patient portals for accessing personal health records, coupled with myriad health information via the internet (eHealth), have provided the potential for electronic personal health information management (ePHIM).  However, great variability exists in access to eHealth information for components of the US population. Despite continuing efforts, this ""digital divide"" remains for rural, minority and low-income communities.  Limited access for ePHIM contributes to the health disparities experienced by these populations.  The goal of this project is to improve the ability of low-income African American, American Indian, Latino, and white older adults living in rural and urban communities to use information technology applications for ePHIM.  The project's conceptual framework combines the Technology Acceptance Model and the person- environmental interaction model.  It uses a community-based participatory partnership of Wake Forest School  of Medicine and its Outpatient Department Medicine Clinic, with Community Partners HealthNet, a network of  18 clinics serving 25 rural North Carolina counties, to achieve 3 specific aims:  (1) document the ePHIM  experience, knowledge, perceived needs, and perceived risks of low-income African American, American  Indian, Latino, and white older adults living in rural and urban communities~ (2) delineate the actual use of  ePHIM by low-income African American, American Indian, Latino, and white older adults living in rural and  urban communities~ and (3) delineate differences in perception, belief and experience in using ePHIM between  patients and caregivers who use versus those who do not use ePHIM.  This project is significant because it will delineate disparities in ePHIM by working with two networks of clinics (Community Partners HealthNet~ Outpatient Department Medicine Clinic/Wake Forest Baptist Health) that provides care to rural and urban, low- income, and minority patients.  Working with these networks, this project will implement in-depth and longitudinal research that will delineate the factors affecting ePHIM use among vulnerable elders.  This project is innovative.  (1)  It will use qualitative data collection techniques within a community-based participatory research framework to assess the motives and barriers to patients' and caregivers' ePHIM among rural as well as urban, low-income, older adult, and minority communities.  (2) It emphasizes the importance of including caregivers, particularly for older adults, in understanding the use of ePHIM.   (3) It will use these qualitative methods to assess the perceptions of health care providers and IT providers about the potential use of ePHIM.   (4) It will use these qualitative methods to determine the factors that facilitated and limited the use of ePHIM by comparing high / expert, medium, and low users.  (5) It will document the actual pattern of ePHIM use among older adults and their caregivers over a one-year period.  (6) It will explore the association of ePHIM use and chronic disease management among older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to access, manage and understand personal health information enables individuals to become better consumers and to participate more fully in making health care decisions.  Within a conceptual framework and using a community-based participatory partnership, this project will delineate the factors that facilitate or limit the useof electronic personal health information management (ePHIM).","Maximizing the Impact of ePHIM in Low-Income, Multiethnic Populations",8881103,R01HS021679,[''],AHRQ,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,489342,0.10514301017069506
"Older adults in vulnerable communities: Health and quality of life over time DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diversity, its growth and complexity, are defining features of the dramatic aging of the world-wide population. Research demonstrates that older adults from disadvantaged populations are at elevated risk of poor health, disability and premature death. The National Institutes of Health are committed to reducing and eliminating health disparities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that health disparities related to sexual orientation are one of the main gaps in health disparities research. Existing evidence demonstrates that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) older adults are an at-risk, under-investigated and under-served health disparate population. This study will examine the determinants of health impacting LGB older adults to assess change in health and quality of life (QOL) over time. Based on an innovative resilience conceptual framework, the pro- posed longitudinal research will obtain data from 2,000 LGB older adults who participated in the original study in order to allow us to understand the inter-relationships between risk and protective factors as well as cohort effects as they impact health and QOL of LGB older adults over time. This multidisciplinary collaboration of University of Washington researchers and community-based collaborators addresses a critical gap by identifying modifiable mechanisms impacting health and QOL over time. The primary goals of the project are as follows: 1) Investigate how lifetime victimization, everyday discrimination, stress (perceived stress and physiological response to stress) and health behavior change affects health and QOL of LGB older adults over time; 2) Evaluate how social relations (time-varying) and sexual identity management (time-varying) affect the associations among everyday discrimination, stress, health and QOL over time; and, 3) Test whether there is cohort heterogeneity in overall levels and age growth trajectories of health and QOL, and to what extent the differences in experiences within a historical context (e.g., time of sexual identity disclosure, lifetime victimization) between Baby Boom and Silent Generation LGB older adults account for these cohort effects. As the population ages, the health care costs associated with health disparities will continue to rise. To respond to this growing public health challenge it is imperative to identfy groups at high risk of disparities and to determine the modifiable mechanisms impacting their health and QOL as they age. The findings from this project will generate needed information to directly inform and guide the development of tailored interventions that can be effectively delivered within community-based agency settings to improve the health and QOL of demographically diverse older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the population ages, the health care costs associated with health disparities continue to rise. To reduce health disparities it is imperative to identify grous at risk of disparities and to determine the modifiable factors impacting their health and quality o life. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) older adults have been identified as an at-risk, under-investigated, and under-served health disparate population. This longitudinal research will identify risk and protective mechanisms impacting the health and quality of life of LGB older adults, which will directly contribute to the development of tailored interventions to improve the health of demographically diverse older adults.",Older adults in vulnerable communities: Health and quality of life over time,8910582,R01AG026526,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Baby Booms ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Generation Effect ', ' Cohort Effect ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Housing ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Time Management ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Complex ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' peer ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Health behavior change ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' longitudinal design ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBTI ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,597759,0.18213166306425996
"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose here our overall plan for the Health Promotion Research Center (HPRC) at the University of Washington for the next five years. One of the original three Prevention Research Centers funded by CDC in 1986, HPRC focuses on promoting healthy aging and reducing health disparities among adults aged 50 and older. Building on our 15 years of experience conducting dissemination and implementation research aimed at scale-up of effective interventions, we plan to focus our work in three areas: cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion.  Specifically, we will expand the national reach of three flagship healthy-aging programs that were developed and tested by HPRC and disseminated by community organizations partnering with HPRC. First is EnhanceFitness, a group-exercise program for older adults. Since 1999, Senior Services, a Seattle-based non- profit organization serving older adults, has disseminated EnhanceFitness to more than 500 community sites in more than 30 states. It has reached more than 25,000 older adults, most of whom are low-income or members of racial and ethnic minorities. Second is PEARLS, a depression-management program delivered in community settings. Since 2003, Area Agencies on Aging have delivered PEARLS to more than 2,000 low-income, largely fragile and home-bound older adults with depression, through 45 sites in 14 states. Third is Workplace Solutions, a package of evidence-based cancer prevention practices for the workplace. Since 2003, the American Cancer Society has disseminated Workplace Solutions to more than 1,600 workplaces with 6.9 million employees in 42 states.  Scale-up of the EnhanceFitness program, with a focus on reducing race/ethnicity-related disparities in arthritis suffering, will be the objective of our Core Researh Project. In 2011, Senior Services licensed EnhanceFitness to YMCA of the USA (Y-USA), the national-network office for more than 2,700 YMCAs. Because EnhanceFitness decreases pain and increases mobility for persons with arthritis, Y-USA will focus its EnhanceFitness implementation on the half of older adults who suffer from arthritis. Older adults are much more likely to participate in a community-based program like EnhanceFitness if it is recommended by a health care provider, so Y-USA has asked for HPRC's help in enhancing its current, limited approach to increasing provider recommendations for EnhanceFitness participation. To do so, we will first conduct formative research with pharmacists and physical therapists to learn the most effective means of increasing recommendations to a community-based program like EnhanceFitness. Second, we will develop an enhanced approach tailored to obtaining recommendations by pharmacists, physical therapists, and primary-care providers for participation of older-adult arthritis patients in EnhanceFitness at YMCAs. Third, we will conduct a cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness and the cost of the current and enhanced approaches.                  HPRC's three healthy-aging focus areas - cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion - address many of the biggest health problems among middle- aged and older adults. Our research is aimed at national expansion of HPRC's three evidence-based healthy- aging programs: EnhanceFitness, which increases physical activity and preserves functioning; PEARLS, which reduces depression; and Workplace Solutions/HealthLinks, which increases employers' use of evidence-based practices to prevent chronic illnesses. These programs all have a record of success in reaching underserved, diverse populations at disparate risk for chronic diseases and related disability and mortality.",Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center,8854775,U48DP005013,[''],NCCDPHP,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U48,2015,2364795,0.14100159479345614
"Epidemiology of Suicidal Behavior in Racially/Ethnically Diverse Older Americans  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This application is in response to RFA-MD-12-001: NIMHD Health Disparities Research. One of the priority areas of this RFA is the study of health conditions associated with significant mortality that have been understudied in health disparity populations. In older Americans, suicide rates are 30% higher than in the general population, and five times higher in non-Hispanic white men age 85 years or older-as the nation continues to grow and racially/ethnically diversify with age so will the rates of suicide. Yet, little is known about suicide-related behaviors (i.e., ideation, plans, and attempts) in older adults, which are strong risk factors for actual suicide and strong indicators of extreme emotional and mental distress. Even more so, differences in suicidal behavior by race/ethnicity have hardly been investigated at all, as most studies are from non-diverse clinic samples. Moreover, most of what we know about mental health services use related to suicide risk in older Americans comes from small non-diverse samples of suicide completers. However, understanding mental health services use and racial disparities in use is important, as all aging adults with emotional and mental distress related to suicidal thoughts and behaviors may benefit from service use and treatment. The proposed project will investigate the prevalence and predictors of suicidal ideation and related behaviors over the lifetime of older racially and ethnically diverse adults, that is, capturing transitions from ideation to plans and attempts and examining risk of late life and current suicidal behavior. It will also investigate mental health services use in those at increased risk of suicide. The aims will be addressed by studying three nationally representative aggregated data sets: 1) the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), a probability sample of the general U.S.; 2) the National Survey of American Life (NSAL), a probability sample of African- American, Afro-Caribbean, and non-Hispanic White Americans; and 3) the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), a probability sample of Latinos and Asian Americans. The project proposes to make innovative use of the combined data and examine a large, nationally-based cohort of over 3,600 respondents aged 55 and older. In a very cost-efficient approach, this project will be the first comprehensive examination of the prevalence and predictors of suicide-related behaviors and mental health services use in older Americans. Key predictors, including sociodemographic variables, psychiatric disorders, and chronic medical conditions associated with suicidal behavior will be determined (Aims 1 and 2)-assessing differences of associations overall and by race/ethnicity, that is, in older non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. In addition, racial disparities will be assessed separately for men and women (Aim 3), and key predictors of mental health services use will be examined overall and by race/ethnicity (Aim 4). Information stemming from this project will be important for identifying those older adults most at risk of suicide and with great need of care-helping to define national priorities for suicide prevention in late life for all Americans.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicidal risk profoundly impacts individuals, families, and society. Knowledge gained from this proposal will be both novel and critical for understanding the occurrence and predictors of suicide-related behaviors (i.e., ideation, planning, and attempts) in older Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White Americans, including use of mental health services in those at increased risk of suicide. Thus, this proposed project will have unique public health importance, because it will provide evidence for future psychiatric research and policy planning that will help to define national priorities for suicide prevention in late life for all Americans.",Epidemiology of Suicidal Behavior in Racially/Ethnically Diverse Older Americans,8788787,R01MD007019,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Anxiety ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Moods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Societies ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Respondent ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' stem ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2015,296400,0.04885192397603233
"Pharmacy Accessibility and Disparities in Adherence to Cardiovascular Medications in Elderly     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to use existing proprietary and public data sources and geospatial methods to determine how the geographic accessibility of pharmacies impacts place-based disparities in adherence to cardiovascular medications among older adults in the U.S. This issue is at the forefront of older adult minority health and health policy, considering the health and survival benefits of cardiovascular medications and recent expansion of older adult prescription drug coverage has failed to reduce disparities in adherence to prescription medications. Further, several national studies indicate that disparities in adherence are not due to individual differences in income, education or health insurance, and suggest older adult minorities may encounter barriers in adhering to prescription medications not experienced by their White counterparts, including the accessibility of pharmacies. Our preliminary analyses suggest substantial place-based disparities in both pharmacy density and adherence to both statins and �locker. For the proposed study, we will leverage geocoded longitudinal patient-level pharmacy claims data for more 50 million Americans, and information on pharmacy locations, in the United States to conduct an observational cohort study to examine how the geographic accessibility of pharmacies or pharmacy density impacts disparities in adherence to commonly used cardiovascular medications, including statins and blockers, among adults 65 years and older in the U.S. We will also examine the role of individual- (e.g. age, poly-pharmacy) and community-level (e.g. poverty, vehicle ownership) factors often associated with adherence. Finally, we will apply geospatial methods using patient-level adherence aggregated at the community-level to identify older adult minority communities most at-risk for low-adherence. Our proposed work is innovative because it will be the first study to incorporate geospatial methods in analyses of disparities in medication adherence at older ages. Our data will also allow for unprecedented granularity in examining individual and community-level factors that influence disparities in adherence at national and local levels. Our focus on the role of the geographic accessibility of pharmacies is novel considering pharmacies are an increasingly important, yet often overlooked, component of U.S. health care delivery in the older adult population. With respect to expected outcomes, the work proposed is expected to contribute new knowledge which policymakers, practitioners and researchers need to develop innovative policies and programs to improve disparities in medication adherence among older adults. This is particularly important given a growing segment of the minority population is publicly insured  and Centers for Medicare/Medicaid Services has endorsed quality measures  that include adherence to cardiovascular medications that have yet to be examined in the context of disparities. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact, as pharmacies will only grow in importance and relevance to health disparities as their scope of services continues to expand to include preventative care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disparities in adherence to cardiovascular medications among older adults is an important public health problem with significant implications for minority health and longevity. We propose to explore innovative methods and hypotheses using existing data sets to elucidate how place-based disparities in adherence to cardiovascular medications are associated with the geographic accessibility of pharmacies in the community, and in turn identify patients and communities most at-risk for low adherence and geographic access. Our work will provide fundamental new knowledge that will only grow in importance and relevance to health disparities as the scope of pharmacy services continues to expand to include preventative care.            ",Pharmacy Accessibility and Disparities in Adherence to Cardiovascular Medications in Elderly,8806291,R21AG049283,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Health Insurance ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Methods ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Ownership ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy Services ', ' Pharmaceutic Services ', ' Pharmaceutical Services ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Poverty ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' United States ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Uninsured ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' minority health ', ' prescription drug costs ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2015,248719,0.10550541835205744
"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose here our overall plan for the Health Promotion Research Center (HPRC) at the University of Washington for the next five years. One of the original three Prevention Research Centers funded by CDC in 1986, HPRC focuses on promoting healthy aging and reducing health disparities among adults aged 50 and older. Building on our 15 years of experience conducting dissemination and implementation research aimed at scale-up of effective interventions, we plan to focus our work in three areas: cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion.  Specifically, we will expand the national reach of three flagship healthy-aging programs that were developed and tested by HPRC and disseminated by community organizations partnering with HPRC. First is EnhanceFitness, a group-exercise program for older adults. Since 1999, Senior Services, a Seattle-based non- profit organization serving older adults, has disseminated EnhanceFitness to more than 500 community sites in more than 30 states. It has reached more than 25,000 older adults, most of whom are low-income or members of racial and ethnic minorities. Second is PEARLS, a depression-management program delivered in community settings. Since 2003, Area Agencies on Aging have delivered PEARLS to more than 2,000 low-income, largely fragile and home-bound older adults with depression, through 45 sites in 14 states. Third is Workplace Solutions, a package of evidence-based cancer prevention practices for the workplace. Since 2003, the American Cancer Society has disseminated Workplace Solutions to more than 1,600 workplaces with 6.9 million employees in 42 states.  Scale-up of the EnhanceFitness program, with a focus on reducing race/ethnicity-related disparities in arthritis suffering, will be the objective of our Core Researh Project. In 2011, Senior Services licensed EnhanceFitness to YMCA of the USA (Y-USA), the national-network office for more than 2,700 YMCAs. Because EnhanceFitness decreases pain and increases mobility for persons with arthritis, Y-USA will focus its EnhanceFitness implementation on the half of older adults who suffer from arthritis. Older adults are much more likely to participate in a community-based program like EnhanceFitness if it is recommended by a health care provider, so Y-USA has asked for HPRC's help in enhancing its current, limited approach to increasing provider recommendations for EnhanceFitness participation. To do so, we will first conduct formative research with pharmacists and physical therapists to learn the most effective means of increasing recommendations to a community-based program like EnhanceFitness. Second, we will develop an enhanced approach tailored to obtaining recommendations by pharmacists, physical therapists, and primary-care providers for participation of older-adult arthritis patients in EnhanceFitness at YMCAs. Third, we will conduct a cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness and the cost of the current and enhanced approaches. HPRC's three healthy-aging focus areas - cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion - address many of the biggest health problems among middle- aged and older adults. Our research is aimed at national expansion of HPRC's three evidence-based healthy- aging programs: EnhanceFitness, which increases physical activity and preserves functioning; PEARLS, which reduces depression; and Workplace Solutions/HealthLinks, which increases employers' use of evidence-based practices to prevent chronic illnesses.

"Stress Biomarkers as a Potential Link Between Age Beliefs and Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Experimental and longitudinal studies have found that older individuals with more negative age beliefs demonstrate worse health outcomes. The mechanism that explains this process is not known. The overall aim of the proposed project is to investigate for the first time whether stress biomarkers over time reflect a biological process tha links negative age beliefs (defined as disparaging perceptions that are assimilated from society about older individuals as a category) with worse health of older individuals. The importance of examining stress biomarkers as the potential mechanism is enhanced by their potential ability to provide a previously unexamined explanation for racial and gender disparities in aging health. The proposed project will draw on two ongoing complementary longitudinal datasets that focus on community-dwelling older individuals. Thus, we will pursue the following aims and hypotheses for the first time: Aim 1: Examine whether older individuals' age beliefs are associated with stress biomarkers over time. Hypothesis 1: Older individuals' negative age beliefs will predict elevated stress biomarkers over time. Aim 2: Examine whether racial and gender disparities exist in the influence of older individuals' age beliefs on stress biomarkers over time. Hypothesis 2a: Older African Americans will be more vulnerable than same-aged older whites to the adverse impact of negative age beliefs on stress biomarkers over time. Hypothesis 2b: Older women will be more vulnerable than same-aged older men to the adverse impact of negative age beliefs on stress biomarkers over time. Aim 3: Examine whether older individuals' stress biomarkers over time mediate the relationship between age beliefs and worse cognitive and physical health over time. Hypothesis 3: Older individuals' stress biomarkers will mediate the relationship between negative age beliefs and worse cognitive health (i.e., memory deficits, risk of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, and smaller hippocampal volume) and worse physical health (i.e., physical-function deficits, risk of cardiovascular events, and higher mortality) over time. Aim 4: Identify the factors that moderate negative age beliefs' influence on older individuals' stress biomarkers over time. Hypothesis 4: Resiliency factors (i.e. Feeling Useful to Others, Openness, and Emotional Stability) and vulnerability factors (i.e., Age-belief Self-relevance and Adverse Life Events) will moderate negative age beliefs' effect on stress biomarkers over time. This study could identify a new and potentially modifiable process, negative age beliefs' association with stress biomarkers over time, as a factor that contributes to adverse health outcomes among older individuals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many individuals are bombarded with a variety of negative age beliefs, throughout their lifespans, that become associated with worse health in later life. The overall goal of the proposed project is to examine whether biological indicators of stress are the mechanism that explains the harmful effects of older individuals' negative age beliefs on their cognitive and physical health. The proposed project could provide the foundation for developing targeted interventions that improve the health of older individuals in general and older women and older African Americans in particular.",Stress Biomarkers as a Potential Link Between Age Beliefs and Health,8929104,R01AG032284,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Baltimore ', ' Belief ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Physical Function ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Emotional ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Negative Finding ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' secondary outcome ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,161505,3.271808054852567e-06
"HIV Testing, Linkage and Retention in Care: Contextual Factors and Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to determine if associations exist between the contexts in which people obtain healthcare (i.e., healthcare context) or live (i.e., residential context) and each of five outcomes (HIV testing, receipt of tes results, linkage to HIV/AIDS care, retention in HIV care and HIV viral load). The epidemiology of HIV/AIDS among racial/ethnic minorities (specifically, Blacks and Latinos) and older adults (i.e., 50 and older) suggests they may encounter barriers that contribute to disparities in early detection of HIV and in their prognoses. Hence, we will also examine disparities in the outcomes by race/ethnicity and older age (age >50).  Drawing on the socio-behavioral sciences, the study will inform clinical practice in ways that promote equity in care across diverse groups, neighborhood conditions and stages of adulthood. The study's primary Specific Aims are to: (1) Examine relations between healthcare context, residential context and HIV testing during primary care visits using logistic regression multilevel models with random effects based on primary care patients' electronic medical records; and, (2) Examine relations between healthcare context, residential context and receipt of HIV test results and linkage to HIV/AIDS care, respectively, among managed care enrollees newly diagnosed as HIV-positive using multilevel logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models with random effects. The secondary Specific Aim is to determine if racial/ethnic- or age-related (i.e., aged <50 vs. >50 years) disparities exist in these relationships.  Building on our work on HIV testing and care, and guided by a model integrating the Public Health Critical Race Praxis and Behavioral Model of Healthcare Utilization, the four-year study based on the electronic medical records (EMRs) of adults enrolled in the largest managed care organization in the region. We will pool data over five years (2007-2011) to examine HIV testing among all patients presenting for primary care, and to examine receipt of HIV test results, linkage to and retention in HIV/AIDS care as well as HIV viral load among all patients newly diagnosed as HIV-positive. The study will comprise four multilevel analyses of patients' residential contexts (e.g., neighborhood HIV prevalence) and healthcare contexts (e.g., characteristics of the patient population) relative to HIV testing durin primary care visits (Aim 1), receipt of HIV test results and linkage to HIV/AIDS care among those diagnosed as HIV-positive (Aim 2), retention in HIV/AIDS care and HIV RNA viral load up to one-year post diagnosis. We will use personal and geospatial codes in the EMRs to link to: (1) files containing detailed information on each provider (e.g., demographics, specialty); (2) public data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on HIV prevalence and HIV test sites in each zip code; (3) 2010 Census socioeconomic data (e.g., concentrated poverty) for each zip code; and, (4) global positioning system software to calculate the distance from a patient's home to their provider. This interdisciplinary, inter- institutional collaboration leveraes the expertise of a diverse team of new and seasoned investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to learn why adults, especially racial/ethnic minorities and older adults, who have insurance may nevertheless not receive HIV testing or HIV/AIDS care at the recommended levels. The study compares MCO enrollees based on their medical records, assigned providers and neighborhood social conditions to see if certain patients have a harder time getting testing or care because of the type of provider they see or because of where they live.","HIV Testing, Linkage and Retention in Care: Contextual Factors and Disparities",8836596,R01NR014789,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency

"Risk and mechanisms of neurocognitive impairment in older HIV-infected Hispanics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) continues to be highly prevalent and debilitating in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, particularly among older persons. Hispanics are the fastest growing segment of the older adult population in the U.S., they are disproportionately represented among cases of HIV infection, and they are at elevated risk for NCI in both HIV and older age, separately. Yet, NCI among older HIV-infected Hispanics has not been examined. This Mentored Career Development Award (K23) application is designed to develop the applicant's skills to become an independent and culturally proficient clinical scientist investigating the role of risk factors for the development of NCI associated wit combined HIV infection and aging among Hispanics. The application contains a targeted research project to examine NCI in older HIV-infected Hispanics (primarily of Mexican origin/descent) and key factors driving ethnic differences in NCI associated with HIV and aging. Elucidation of psychosocial and biomedical factors that might lead to ethnic differences in NCI is a foundational step in developing targeted, culturally-relevant interventions to improve or minimize NCI, and thus reduce health disparities in this subpopulation. Among the many potential predictors of NCI, we focus on a set of potentially modifiable health behaviors that are particularly problematic among Hispanics, namely use of health services and personal practices associated with a healthy lifestyle (i.e., diet, and physical and cognitive activity). We also aim o examine some of the biomedical factors that might mediate the association of these health behaviors with NCI, including HIV disease burden and metabolic syndrome. Recognizing that Hispanics are a heterogeneous group, the research component of the present proposal focuses primarily on Hispanics of Mexican origin/descent, who are the largest Hispanic subgroup in the U.S. In support of the research proposal and the candidate's long-term goals, the comprehensive proposed training program builds on the applicant's background in clinical neuropsychology, as well as clinical research on cognitive aging and the neuropsychology of HIV, to gain key neuroAIDS knowledge (i.e. neuroAIDS disparities, and the intersection of HIV and aging), clinical research skills of particular relevance for cross-cultural studies (i.e. biostatistics, bioethics, and community engagement), as well as leadership and scientific communication skills. The multidisciplinary mentoring team includes expertise in all aspects of this proposal including neuroAIDS disparities (Primary Mentor: Dr. Robert Heaton; Co-mentor: Mara Luisa Zuniga; Consultant: Mariana Cherner; Collaborator: Dr. Mario de la Rosa); the intersection of aging and HIV (Co-Mentor: Dr. Dilip Jeste) including neuromedical implications (Consultant: Dr. Ronald Ellis); and cross-cultural psychometrics and biostatistics (Dr. Heaton and Consultants: Drs. Dan Mungas and Florin Vaida), bioethics (Dr. Zuniga), and community engagement (Dr. Zuniga). The present proposal will capitalize primarily on the University of California San Diego infrastructure, including the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program, the Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, the Division of Global Public Health, and the Clinical and Translational Research Institute. It will also leverage expertise at the Universit of California Davis, and Florida International University. The excellent mentoring team and robust infrastructure will provide critical support to the applicant to successfully complete her training goals. This key training and new experience in executing the proposed research plan, along with her past clinical and research experiences and her Hispanic background will place her in a unique position to conduct highly impactful research that will serve the needs of a growing, underserved and vulnerable segment of the U.S. population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) aims to investigate differences between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites in neurocognitive impairment (i.e., problems with attention, learning and memory, and other cognitive skills) associated with HIV and aging. This is an important public health priority because 1) neurocognitive problems in HIV are debilitating and especially prevalent as the number of HIV-infected persons reaching older age grows; and 2) Hispanics have higher rates of HIV-infection and worse HIV disease than non-Hispanic Whites, are the fastest growing ethnic group among older adults in the U.S., and have higher risk for neurocognitive problems both in HIV and in older age. Knowledge of the psychosocial and biomedical factors related to Hispanic ethnicity that increase risk for neurocognitive impairment associated with HIV and aging can help develop targeted, culturally relevant interventions to prevent and/or decrease neurocognitive impairment in this group and reduce health disparities.",Risk and mechanisms of neurocognitive impairment in older HIV-infected

"2/2 - Suicide Prevention in Chinese Older Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This two-site (Rush University and Northwestern University) linked re-submission of R34MH100443 collaborative application aims to design a culturally tailored and community- engaged intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts in US Chinese older adults, who have the highest suicide rate than any other racial/ethnic groups. Despite this health disparity, we have great paucity in our understanding of cultural issues surrounding suicide in Chinese populations, and this has directly hampered the intervention efforts. Accordingly, we seek to support a geriatrician (Dong) with expertise in aging, mental health and Chinese culture, and an interventionist (Simon) with expertise in clinical trials using community health workers to reduce health disparities among minority populations. More specifically, we aim to 1) expand synergistic academic and community partnerships; 2) iteratively design and refine a culturally meaningful pilot intervention to reduce suicidal thought; 3) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial; and 4) rigorously evaluate the cultural acceptability of the proposed intervention at multiple levels. This study will set the cornerstone for the next R01 application to fully test the efficacy of a culturally tailored intervention to reuce suicidal thoughts in Chinese aging populations.  By 2030, Chinese older adults will account for a quarter of the world's aging populations. Despite the rapid growth of Chinese populations in the US, there are marked health disparities among Chinese older adults, which are further exacerbated by the complex linguistic and cultural nuances in studying Chinese populations, particularly on issues of suicidal thoughts. Moreover, there has been inadequate and sustainable community support necessary to empower the Chinese community to be fully engaged as equal partners in research. In this application, a bilingual and bicultural principal investigator and an interdisciplinary investigative team have leveraged the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR), building on our prior NIH funded CBPR projects to partner synergistically and sustainably with the Chicago Chinese community in order to overcome these challenges and set the foundation for this proposal. The study findings will inform clinicians, investigators, communities, social services and policy makers to: a) improve our in-depth understanding of cultural issues surrounding suicide; b) empower community to be equal partners in mental health research; c) guide the next R01 intervention study; and d) inform practice and policy on suicide care in Chinese older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This R34 resubmission will collaborative and iteratively design and refine a culturally adapted intervention to reduce the frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts in Chinese older adults. This has implication for investigators, clinicians, community, social services and policy makers to reduce suicide in Chinese older adults.",2/2 - Suicide Prevention in Chinese Older Adults,9069067,R34MH100393,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Chicago ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institutes ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose here our overall plan for the Health Promotion Research Center (HPRC) at the University of Washington for the next five years. One of the original three Prevention Research Centers funded by CDC in 1986, HPRC focuses on promoting healthy aging and reducing health disparities among adults aged 50 and older. Building on our 15 years of experience conducting dissemination and implementation research aimed at scale-up of effective interventions, we plan to focus our work in three areas: cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion.  Specifically, we will expand the national reach of three flagship healthy-aging programs that were developed and tested by HPRC and disseminated by community organizations partnering with HPRC. First is EnhanceFitness, a group-exercise program for older adults. Since 1999, Senior Services, a Seattle-based non- profit organization serving older adults, has disseminated EnhanceFitness to more than 500 community sites in more than 30 states. It has reached more than 25,000 older adults, most of whom are low-income or members of racial and ethnic minorities. Second is PEARLS, a depression-management program delivered in community settings. Since 2003, Area Agencies on Aging have delivered PEARLS to more than 2,000 low-income, largely fragile and home-bound older adults with depression, through 45 sites in 14 states. Third is Workplace Solutions, a package of evidence-based cancer prevention practices for the workplace. Since 2003, the American Cancer Society has disseminated Workplace Solutions to more than 1,600 workplaces with 6.9 million employees in 42 states.  Scale-up of the EnhanceFitness program, with a focus on reducing race/ethnicity-related disparities in arthritis suffering, will be the objective of our Core Researh Project. In 2011, Senior Services licensed EnhanceFitness to YMCA of the USA (Y-USA), the national-network office for more than 2,700 YMCAs. Because EnhanceFitness decreases pain and increases mobility for persons with arthritis, Y-USA will focus its EnhanceFitness implementation on the half of older adults who suffer from arthritis. Older adults are much more likely to participate in a community-based program like EnhanceFitness if it is recommended by a health care provider, so Y-USA has asked for HPRC's help in enhancing its current, limited approach to increasing provider recommendations for EnhanceFitness participation. To do so, we will first conduct formative research with pharmacists and physical therapists to learn the most effective means of increasing recommendations to a community-based program like EnhanceFitness. Second, we will develop an enhanced approach tailored to obtaining recommendations by pharmacists, physical therapists, and primary-care providers for participation of older-adult arthritis patients in EnhanceFitness at YMCAs. Third, we will conduct a cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness and the cost of the current and enhanced approaches.                  HPRC's three healthy-aging focus areas - cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion - address many of the biggest health problems among middle- aged and older adults. Our research is aimed at national expansion of HPRC's three evidence-based healthy- aging programs: EnhanceFitness, which increases physical activity and preserves functioning; PEARLS, which reduces depression; and Workplace Solutions/HealthLinks, which increases employers' use of evidence-based practices to prevent chronic illnesses. These programs all have a record of success in reaching underserved, diverse populations at disparate risk for chronic diseases and related disability and mortality.",Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center,9230021,U48DP005013,[''],NCCDPHP,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U48,2016,344396,0.14100159479345614
"Influence of Adult Latina Daughters on Older Latina Mothers HIV Risk and Protective Behaviors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: HIV infection rates for older Latinos in the United States are 5 times higher than those of their non-Latino White counterparts. Researchers have shown that older Latina women (ages 50+) are at particularly increased risk of acquiring HIV infection due to factors such as sparse participation in HIV prevention programs, less HIV knowledge, and a decreased likelihood of discussing sexual and substance use behaviors and HIV protection with their primary care physicians. Additionally, Latina women report higher rates of HIV risk behaviors-such as having sex under the influence of alcohol-than non-Latina White or Black women. Recent studies have found that adult daughters may be in a unique position to influence their mothers' health-related decisions. Specifically, study findings suggest mother-daughter attachment may have a protective influence on substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors of adult Latinas. Objective: This study proposes to examine (a) associations between the HIV risk and protective behavior trajectories (over time) of adult Latina daughters and those of their older Latina mothers and (b) the influence of mother-daughter attachment and alcohol use on associations between mother-daughter HIV risk and protective behavior trajectories. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that older Latina mothers with greater mother/daughter attachment and less alcohol use will have HIV risk and protective behaviors that are most strongly associated with those of their adult Latina daughters. Design: The proposed longitudinal study will be conducted using secondary data from a 7-year study investigating the intergenerational transmission of substance use and HIV risk behavior trajectories in a community-based sample of 316 Latina mothers and daughters. Significance: Results of this study can expand scientific understanding of HIV risk and protective factors associated with older Latina women. With the number of HIV cases among this population expected to rise in the coming years, the need to better understand and address the factors that place older Latina women at increased risk for HIV is of great public health significance. This knowledge could inform research literature and clinicians about the culturally relevant and age-specific factors that should be targeted in HIV prevention programs with this population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall objective of the proposed study is to determine (a) the influence that adult Latina daughters' HIV risk and protective behaviors trajectories have on those of their older Latina mothers (b) how mother- daughter attachment and alcohol use patterns influence those associations. Results from this study can inform researchers as to appropriate strategies in reaching this difficult to access population of older Latinas, who have been historically understudied, despite their high incidence rate of HIV infection and risky behavior. This study is of high public health relevance given the severe dearth in prevention strategies aimed at decreasing the HIV-related health disparities experienced by older Latinas.            ",Influence of Adult Latina Daughters on Older Latina Mothers HIV Risk and Protective Behaviors,9129542,F31MD009553,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Behavior ', ' Berry ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Daughter ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Florida ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Influentials ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mothers ', ' Terminology ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Rose ', ' Rosa ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Walkers ', ' Woman ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Attenuated ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' safer sexual behavior ', ' safer sex ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Safe Sex ', ' intergenerational ', ' Familiarity ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' Adult Children ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' risk perception ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Older Population ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' protective behavior ', ' Population ', ' older women ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' mother-daughter relationship ', ' ']",NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,18588,0.007269513045303182
"Activity Space, Social Interaction and Health Trajectories in Later Life ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central goal of this research program is to describe the social and spatial environments in which older adults spend their time. We focus on the extent to which this activity space influences health trajectories. We theorize that the components of the person-environment relationship, including household, neighborhood, and network contexts, are interrelated and mutually constituted. We aim to 1) describe the activity space that older adults inhabit, and 2) explore the extent to which activity space, and the network, household, and neighborhood exposures related to it, affect short-term and pre-clinical changes in health. We will collect primary, multi-wave data from 600 Chicagoans aged 65 and older. We incorporate reports of network connectedness and activity tracking across physical space using GPS methodology. By equipping respondents with smart phones, we are able to collect real-time data on latitude, longitude and distance traveled. We use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology to obtain respondents' reports of their social settings, health status, health behaviors, and well- being. In-person interviews will obtain self-reported and objective indices of health, including body mass index and a salivary measure to assess chronic stress exposure. A particularly innovative feature of this study is the ability to capture changes n quotidian symptoms, potentially indicative of chronic disease onset.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tracking older adults' movements-in, out of, and across their communities-will provide insight into their span of engagement, the contexts most relevant for their health and well-being, and their access to social and community resources.

"End-of-Life in Assisted Living: Links between Structure, Process, and Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the demographic imperative of a rapidly aging population, a major challenge of the 21st century will be the growing prevalence of older adults who die from old age, most within the context of advanced chronic illness. Increasing numbers of these older adults will receive care and die in assisted living (AL), currently the fastest growing long-term care (LTC) option. The proposed five-year prospective qualitative study will investigate end-of-life (EOL) care in AL from the perspective of multiple stakeholders (residents, AL staff, informal caregivers, and external care providers, e.g., hospice workers). We will use a multifaceted multilevel conceptual framework and draw upon salient aspects of social ecological theory, Donabedian's structure- process-outcome (SPO) quality-of-care paradigm, relational theory, as well as domains of quality adapted from The National Consensus Project (NCP) Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care. The overall goal of the proposed research is to address critical knowledge gaps and identify best practices for EOL care in AL. The three specific aims are: (1) understand how EOL is defined and experienced by AL residents and other key stakeholders; (2) investigate the structure and process of formal and informal care in AL and understand the interface between these care components and how they shape outcomes; and (3) identify the contexts and conditions within which structures and processes of care are shaped and understand the combined impact these aspects of care have on stakeholders' overall EOL experience. Increasingly, LTC scholars and policy-makers are calling for a broader definition of EOL that encompasses different EOL transitions, including dying as a phase of advanced chronic illness that may extend for years, as well as dying at the end of old age. In order to provide adequate support services and timely palliative care, it is important to acknowledge and identify these varying and often ambiguous EOL trajectories. Following the Institute of Medicine, we define the EOL experience broadly to include periods of decline associated with advanced age or chronic illness where the timing of death is uncertain. To investigate the EOL process as it unfolds over time, we will use grounded theory methods to study eight diverse AL settings in Georgia that vary according to size (6-15 beds; 16-24 beds; 25-50 beds; and 51+ beds), resident and staff profile, rural/urban location, ownership, licensing status, and resources. The study will include low-income, rural, and racial/ethnic minority residents, groups typically excluded from AL research, as well as residents living in dementia units. Data collection in each home will extend over two years and include: 271 in-depth interviews, informal interviewing, review of focal residents' social and health records, and participant observation. The proposed study will identify modifiable factors associated with adverse EOL experiences and potential disparities in care that can be targets of intervention at multiple ecological levels and contribute to ongoing efforts to transform and improve the quality of EOL care for older adults in LTC and other care settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed five-year prospective qualitative study investigates end-of- life (EOL) care in Georgia assisted living (AL) facilities. Such research is crucial given the growing use of AL, the increasing frailty and diversity of the AL population, and the rising number of deaths reported in AL each year. This study, which is the first to date to focus on EOL care in AL in depth, will offer valuable insights to researchers, policy-makers, and service providers.","End-of-Life in Assisted Living: Links between Structure, Process, and Outcomes",9064050,R01AG047408,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Beds ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospices ', ' hospice environment ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' living will ', ' Living Wills ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Methods ', ' Ownership ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Societies ', ' Terminally Ill ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Licensing ', ' Shapes ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' frailty ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' health record ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Process ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' collaborative environment ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' informal care ', ' informal caregiver ', ' Informal care giver ', ' Formal caregiver ', ' Formal care giver ', ' dementia care ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' ']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,367230,0.058129670255206156
"Communities Designed to Support Cardiovascular Health for Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Business establishments have the potential to shape individual behaviors including dietary intake, physical activity patterns, and management of chronic medical conditions, all with relevance to risk of myocardial infarction and related cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Policy strategies targeting local businesses may play an important role in CVD prevention, extending years of healthy life, and facilitating independent living. We propose to bring together commercially available ""big data"" and detailed population-based cohort data to examine the role of local business environments in CVD and racial disparities in CVD as they emerged across decades. Longitudinal studies of local environments have been strongly recommended as a direction for future research to advance our understanding of causal neighborhood effects on health. The local density of businesses with potential relevance to CVD has changed over time, and such temporal fluctuations vary across regions, cities and neighborhoods. These differences can be used to investigate how residentially stable older adults are affected by their local context. Meanwhile, older adults who relocate to a new home address may respond to their new context by changing health behaviors, offering another window into causation. However, careful attention is needed to acute health changes that precipitate relocation, and which local environment features predict aging in place despite new health or functional limitations. In the proposed project, we will link longitudinal data to investigate how neighborhood change and residential relocation shape cardiovascular health and health disparities. We will use a census of national businesses, the National Establishment Time Series (NETS). NETS data for all 52.4 million US business establishments includes annual point-level geocodes and business characteristics for the years 1990-2012, offering an unprecedented opportunity to characterize changing business environments nationally at multiple spatial scales. Geographic context data (from NETS as well as longitudinal population, safety, and transportation data) will be linked to individual data from two ongoing cohort studies: the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study. CHS is a well-characterized population- based study of 5,888 older adults (100% age 65+ at baseline, 58% female, 16% African American). A majority of the CHS participants enrolled 1990-1993 from four US sites, with         oversampling of African Americans, have been followed prospectively for the remainder of their lives, allowing in-depth characterization of neighborhood environments experienced by older adults in their final decades. REGARDS is also a prospective population-based cohort study with oversampling of African Americans, allowing for examination of racial disparities. However, the 30,239 REGARDS participants (49% age 65+ at baseline, 55% female, 42% African American) were enrolled more recently (2003-2007) and from a broader geographic region (48 contiguous US states, oversampling Stroke Belt residents). For these two cohorts with complementary strengths, cardiovascular events have been ascertained and longitudinal address data collected. This project brings together unparalleled data resources, builds on a track record of policy-relevant work with large geographic data resources, and leverages comprehensive cardiovascular cohort data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Businesses represent sources of food, walking destinations, and opportunities to access medical care. These aspects of the local environment have the potential to support healthy lifestyles, heart health, and independent living for an aging population. Following recommendations to study how neighborhood change affects health, this project brings together (1) unparalleled neighborhood data on all 52.4 million US businesses from 1990-2012, (2) detailed data on health of 36,127 adults over time from two cohort studies, and (3) an interdisciplinary research team with a track record of conducting and disseminating policy-relevant

"Emergency Department Identification and Care of Suicidal Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA) continue to be a serious concern among older adults, with depression affecting an estimated 7% of all adults over age 65 years (11) and the highest worldwide suicide rates documented for older men.(3,7) Suicide prevention for older adults has unique challenges because older suicidal individuals are more likely to use advance planning and less likely to ask for help.(9) Prior work has suggested that clinicians may under-diagnose or under-treat depression and SI among older adults.(21-22) Early recognition and treatment of depression, as well as improved management of chronic health conditions, can make a difference among older adults by improving quality of life and reducing morbidity and mortality.(25) There is evidence that targeted interventions in primary care settings can improve rates of screening and treatment for depression (41), but very little is known about SI/SA among older emergency department (ED) patients, who may be at increased risk compared to the general population because of comorbidities (32) and acute physical (32) or psychosocial (33) stresses. While some EDs are moving towards universal screening for SI/SA, most still rely on targeted questioning triggered by clinician concern. Understanding which older ED patients may be suicidal could help clinicians more easily identify this high-risk group, and understanding current patterns of treatment-including identification of disparities in care between older and younger patients with SI/SA-could help improve ED care. The overall goal of this research is to lay the groundwork for the development of effective ED-based interventions for suicide prevention by better describing the population of older ED patients with self-harm/SI/SA. For our first specific aim, we use the large database from a multi-site trial of universal ED screening for SI/SA (""Emergency Department Safety Assessment and Follow-up Evaluation,"" ED-SAFE) to provide an estimate of the prevalence of SI/SA among older ED patients, including variations among age groups. For our second specific aim, we will conduct a more detailed retrospective chart review at one ED to describe the patient characteristics and ED treatment of older ED patients with SI/SA, including possible disparities in care. The findings from this research proposal will provide the essential scientific foundation for future design and implementation of evidence-based interventions to improve ED recognition and care of older adults with suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Such interventions have the potential to improve the quality of life of older adults with mental illness and to prevent premature death from suicide. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicide are common among older adults and have significant negative effects on physical health, well-being, morbidity and mortality. Age-adjusted suicide rates are highest among older men, and suicide prevention can be difficult in this age group because older adults are more likely to use lethal methods and advance planning and are less likely to ask for help. Unfortunately, medical providers may under-recognize the signs of depression or suicidality among older adults and therefore miss opportunities for intervention. Emergency departments (EDs) care for large volumes of older patients, but very little is known about suicidal thoughts or behaviors among older ED patients. In order to develop effective suicide prevention approaches for older ED patients, it is important we understand the magnitude of the problem (prevalence of suicidal thoughts or behaviors among older patients), patient characteristics associated with suicidal thoughts or behaviors (to help clinicians identify these high-risk patients), and current patterns f care of older and younger patients with suicidal thoughts or behaviors (to identify and address age-based disparities in care).",Emergency Department Identification and Care of Suicidal Older Adults,9130310,R03MH107551,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"HIV Testing, Linkage and Retention in Care: Contextual Factors and Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to determine if associations exist between the contexts in which people obtain healthcare (i.e., healthcare context) or live (i.e., residential context) and each of five outcomes (HIV testing, receipt of tes results, linkage to HIV/AIDS care, retention in HIV care and HIV viral load). The epidemiology of HIV/AIDS among racial/ethnic minorities (specifically, Blacks and Latinos) and older adults (i.e., 50 and older) suggests they may encounter barriers that contribute to disparities in early detection of HIV and in their prognoses. Hence, we will also examine disparities in the outcomes by race/ethnicity and older age (age >50).  Drawing on the socio-behavioral sciences, the study will inform clinical practice in ways that promote equity in care across diverse groups, neighborhood conditions and stages of adulthood. The study's primary Specific Aims are to: (1) Examine relations between healthcare context, residential context and HIV testing during primary care visits using logistic regression multilevel models with random effects based on primary care patients' electronic medical records; and, (2) Examine relations between healthcare context, residential context and receipt of HIV test results and linkage to HIV/AIDS care, respectively, among managed care enrollees newly diagnosed as HIV-positive using multilevel logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models with random effects. The secondary Specific Aim is to determine if racial/ethnic- or age-related (i.e., aged <50 vs. >50 years) disparities exist in these relationships.  Building on our work on HIV testing and care, and guided by a model integrating the Public Health Critical Race Praxis and Behavioral Model of Healthcare Utilization, the four-year study based on the electronic medical records (EMRs) of adults enrolled in the largest managed care organization in the region. We will pool data over five years (2007-2011) to examine HIV testing among all patients presenting for primary care, and to examine receipt of HIV test results, linkage to and retention in HIV/AIDS care as well as HIV viral load among all patients newly diagnosed as HIV-positive. The study will comprise four multilevel analyses of patients' residential contexts (e.g., neighborhood HIV prevalence) and healthcare contexts (e.g., characteristics of the patient population) relative to HIV testing durin primary care visits (Aim 1), receipt of HIV test results and linkage to HIV/AIDS care among those diagnosed as HIV-positive (Aim 2), retention in HIV/AIDS care and HIV RNA viral load up to one-year post diagnosis. We will use personal and geospatial codes in the EMRs to link to: (1) files containing detailed information on each provider (e.g., demographics, specialty); (2) public data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on HIV prevalence and HIV test sites in each zip code; (3) 2010 Census socioeconomic data (e.g., concentrated poverty) for each zip code; and, (4) global positioning system software to calculate the distance from a patient's home to their provider. This interdisciplinary, inter- institutional collaboration leveraes the expertise of a diverse team of new and seasoned investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to learn why adults, especially racial/ethnic minorities and older adults, who have insurance may nevertheless not receive HIV testing or HIV/AIDS care at the recommended levels. The study compares MCO enrollees based on their medical records, assigned providers and neighborhood social conditions to see if certain patients have a harder time getting testing or care because of the type of provider they see or because of where they live.","HIV Testing, Linkage and Retention in Care: Contextual Factors and Disparities",9010628,R01NR014789,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency

"Pharmacy Accessibility and Disparities in Adherence to Cardiovascular Medications in Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to use existing proprietary and public data sources and geospatial methods to determine how the geographic accessibility of pharmacies impacts place-based disparities in adherence to cardiovascular medications among older adults in the U.S. This issue is at the forefront of older adult minority health and health policy, considering the health and survival benefits of cardiovascular medications and recent expansion of older adult prescription drug coverage has failed to reduce disparities in adherence to prescription medications. Further, several national studies indicate that disparities in adherence are not due to individual differences in income, education or health insurance, and suggest older adult minorities may encounter barriers in adhering to prescription medications not experienced by their White counterparts, including the accessibility of pharmacies. Our preliminary analyses suggest substantial place-based disparities in both pharmacy density and adherence to both statins and �locker. For the proposed study, we will leverage geocoded longitudinal patient-level pharmacy claims data for more 50 million Americans, and information on pharmacy locations, in the United States to conduct an observational cohort study to examine how the geographic accessibility of pharmacies or pharmacy density impacts disparities in adherence to commonly used cardiovascular medications, including statins and blockers, among adults 65 years and older in the U.S. We will also examine the role of individual- (e.g. age, poly-pharmacy) and community-level (e.g. poverty, vehicle ownership) factors often associated with adherence. Finally, we will apply geospatial methods using patient-level adherence aggregated at the community-level to identify older adult minority communities most at-risk for low-adherence. Our proposed work is innovative because it will be the first study to incorporate geospatial methods in analyses of disparities in medication adherence at older ages. Our data will also allow for unprecedented granularity in examining individual and community-level factors that influence disparities in adherence at national and local levels. Our focus on the role of the geographic accessibility of pharmacies is novel considering pharmacies are an increasingly important, yet often overlooked, component of U.S. health care delivery in the older adult population. With respect to expected outcomes, the work proposed is expected to contribute new knowledge which policymakers, practitioners and researchers need to develop innovative policies and programs to improve disparities in medication adherence among older adults. This is particularly important given a growing segment of the minority population is publicly insured  and Centers for Medicare/Medicaid Services has endorsed quality measures  that include adherence to cardiovascular medications that have yet to be examined in the context of disparities. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact, as pharmacies will only grow in importance and relevance to health disparities as their scope of services continues to expand to include preventative care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disparities in adherence to cardiovascular medications among older adults is an important public health problem with significant implications for minority health and longevity. We propose to explore innovative methods and hypotheses using existing data sets to elucidate how place-based disparities in adherence to cardiovascular medications are associated with the geographic accessibility of pharmacies in the community, and in turn identify patients and communities most at-risk for low adherence and geographic access. Our work will provide fundamental new knowledge that will only grow in importance and relevance to health disparities as the scope of pharmacy services continues to expand to include preventative care.",Pharmacy Accessibility and Disparities in Adherence to Cardiovascular Medications in Elderly,8994702,R21AG049283,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incentives ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Health Insurance ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Methods ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Ownership ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy Services ', ' Pharmaceutic Services ', ' Pharmaceutical Services ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Poverty ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' United States ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Uninsured ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' minority health ', ' prescription drug costs ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2016,193966,0.10550541835205744
"Accelerating Translation of Knowledge to Community Practices for Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R13 application requests partial support for two workshops that will be the second round in a series offered by The Gerontological Society of America (GSA) and the John A. Hartford Geriatric National Center on Gerontological Social Work Excellence. Each workshop in the series examines a topic representing an arena of community-based practice where organizations have the potential to widely implement evidence-based interventions. Knowledge on each topic is at a different point of development for improving care in real-world settings. Thus, across all topics, the workshop objectives are to: 1) assess and clarify the state of translational research and identify the next logical steps ""in translation,"" whether that be treatment development, treatment adaptation, implementation or dissemination research; 2) identify opportunities and challenges for translational work from the perspective of community partners; and 3) explore interdisciplinary and agency partnerships to move this work forward. Experts in dissemination and implementation science, gerontologists currently involved in translational studies on the topic, and representatives of the community-based perspective will present. The topics of the workshops, to be offered as preconference workshops at the GSA annual conferences in 2015 and 2016, are older workers and LGBT older adults. Participants will be solicited from GSA members with a particular focus on members of the Hartford Geriatric Social Work Initiative and the Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research. Funds are budgeted to support eight junior investigators per workshop, who will also participate in a poster event in conjunction with an opening reception. Outcomes for each workshop include a summary of the workshop's proceedings and findings to be distributed widely. Session chairs are encouraged to organize a symposium for the next annual GSA meeting, moving the topic forward based on learnings from the workshop; and to pursue publication of the workshop presentations. These workshops will increase participants' capacity to successfully respond to the growing number of calls for translational work, like NIA's PA 14-161 and PAS 11-281 and NIH's PAR 13-055. We believe that this project is unique in several ways: selecting a series of topics highly relevant to community-based practice; learning from national experts on implementation and dissemination science; honing in on the current state of translational work; and ensuring the perspective of community-based organizations. Although there have been many conferences on these aging topics, we do not believe that there have been other conferences that have approached the problem of moving knowledge into practice in this fashion. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The gap between the development of evidence-based interventions and the use of those interventions in real-world settings has been widely noted, and there have been numerous calls to accelerate the movement of effective interventions to diverse settings and populations. The proposed workshops seek to energize and focus applied researchers to translate knowledge into widespread and sustainable practices in community-based organizations serving older adults. This effort represents a unique systematic attempt to increase the use of evidence-based practices in community-based organizations serving vulnerable older adults. 1",Accelerating Translation of Knowledge to Community Practices for Older Adults,9087124,R13AG050451,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Budgets ', ' Communities ', ' Faculty ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Learning ', ' Mission ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Persons ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Societies ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Caring ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' meetings ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Community Practice ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' geriatric social work ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' translational study ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' knowledge translation ', ' community based practice ', ' effective intervention ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Community of Practice ', ' family caregiving ', ' family care giving ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIA,GERONTOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,R13,2016,45400,0.007111242772787646
"Community Choirs to Promote Healthy Aging and Independence of Older Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The United States is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults. In 2009, there were 39.6 million individuals over age 65, and this number is expected to almost double by 2030. During the same time period, there will be an increase in the number of older adults with diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds who are at increased risk for poor health outcomes relative to non-minority elders. Thus, there is an immediate need to identify cost-effective, widely applicable, and sustainable programs that promote health and well-being of older adults. A growing body of literature suggests that participation in community choral singing may also have positive health benefits for older adults, but there is a need to evaluate the efficacy of a choral program for diverse older adults, and a well-designed randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to help strengthen the evidence base. Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to test the efficacy of community choir program for maintaining health and well-being in culturally diverse older adults. To address the aims of the study, we will evaluate a comprehensive set of outcomes that are hypothesized to be related to choral singing and complete a cost analysis. We will recruit 450 diverse older adults and will utilize 12 existing Administration on Aging-supported senior centers to implement a multi-site, randomized (by center) clinical trial (RCT). Centers will be randomized to receive the choir program immediately (intervention group) or after a 6-month delayed intervention phase (control group). The community choirs will be led by professional music directors. We will assess both primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 months (and 18 months for the delayed intervention group). We will also evaluate the start- up and ongoing program costs for senior centers, including cost/person served and determine quality adjusted life years. If successful, results from this RCT may help develop and further the premise that creative arts can be applied to helping solve national health priorities, such as keeping older adults active, independent, and involved in their communities in readily accessible, affordable, and sustainable ways. The United States is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, a group that is at increased risk of poor health relative to non-minorities.

"Peer Empowerment Program for Physical Activity in Low Income & Minority Seniors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peer Empowerment Program for Physical Activity in Low Income & Minority Seniors Older adults are the least active population group in the US. Yet, research has shown that an increase in physical activity (PA) can have immediate and profound effects on cardiovascular health. Older adults who are active use significantly fewer health care resources, and with the increasing number of older adults in the US it is imperative to curb health care expenditure in this group. Many PA interventions are flawed because they focus on individual motivations and ignore variations in community resources, neighborhood walkability, and safety. Low income and ethnically diverse communities have disproportionately fewer resources and less supportive neighborhoods. This contributes to lower PA levels and health disparities in obesity, diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. National and international health institutions have called for community based PA programs to improve population health. Senior centers are an ideal setting for PA interventions because they serve a large number of older adults and there are funding mechanisms for delivery of evidence based programs. While there are multiple benefits of different PA programs, national guidelines for PA still emphasize aerobic activity. Senior Centers currently offer group based PA programs but our preliminary studies show that 1) low income, ethnically diverse older adults attending such centers are not meeting PA guidelines, 2) evidence based programs in such centers do not generate moderate intensity PA, 3) they do not provide behavioral strategies to support more frequent and independent PA and 4) members are not involved in the delivery of such programs which may increase engagement and sustainability. We propose to build upon our NHLBI R01 funded PA program that increased aerobic activity in retirement community residents. The program was delivered by UCSD health educators for 6 months with the help of peer leaders who then sustained it over 12 months. To improve upon this work, we propose a train the trainer model with a greater focus on empowering the peer leaders, center staff and participants to self-monitor, self-organize and advocate for additional resources from the start. Since our aim is to test a PA program that can be adopted by local area aging agencies with Older Americans Act Title IIID funds, we will employ an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design; which allows for the concurrent testing of both intervention and implementation strategies and outcomes. We will also extend program monitoring to 24 months. Thus, in a 2-year cluster randomized controlled field trial of 408 ethnically diverse, older adults (50+ years old) in 12 low income Senior Centers in San Diego County we will investigate the efficacy of PEP4PA (Peer Empowerment Program 4 Physical Activity) to reduce disparities in PA by increasing the percentage of participants achieving 150 minutes of PA per week and to improve physical functioning & fitness, blood pressure, depressive symptoms and quality of life at 6, 12 & 24 months. We will assess the incremental cost effectiveness ratio of PEP4PA in terms of cost per MET hour and cost per QALY compared to usual programming in the control centers at 12 & 24 months. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older adults are the least active population group in the US. Disparities by income exist for key diseases related to physical activity (PA).

"Health IT decision support to improve medication management safety and quality DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For older adults, polypharmacy is a major safety issue with serious economic implications. Dr. Gerardo Moreno proposes research needed to investigate the use of health information technology (HIT) to improve medication management decision making for older adults in community health centers. The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award will provide Dr. Moreno, a family medicine physician from UCLA, the resources to focus his research on aging and to obtain additional research training needed to become an independent principal investigator. The detailed research and career development experiences proposed aim to build upon his existing research skill set to gain needed expertise to: 1) develop his independence as a productive principal investigator in the area of Latino aging health disparities; 2) further focus his research and gain significant expertise in aging-related issues; and 3) expand his qualitative research skills and implementation science skills. To achieve these goals, Dr. Moreno will complete course work, directed reading tutorials, and practical research experience. The career development activities also include mentorship and resources from the UCLA Resource Center for Minority Aging Research, a program devoted to eliminating disparities in health and health care among minority elders and to developing minority faculty who will be independently funded investigators who conduct aging research. Dr. Moreno's multidisciplinary mentorship team includes a health services researcher, social scientist, health informatics researcher, statistician with formal computer science training, and geriatrician. This proposal will use principles of community-based participatory research to build upon an established 4 year academic-community research partnership developed by the applicant with a large rural community health center.            For older adults with multiple chronic conditions, polypharmacy can lead to increased use of potentially inappropriate medications and at the same time to the underutilization of medications known to improve health outcomes. Health (IT) tools may improve decision making for medication management but we know little about their application in community health centers and other safety-net settings. An overall objective of this proposal is to enhance Dr. Moreno's research skills and to conduct preliminary studies needed to develop health IT point-of-care (POC) decision support tailored to the prescription drug management needs of older adults in a safety-net system. Health IT POC clinical decision support in community health centers can be adopted by clinicians and hold great promise for improving the safety and quality of medication management for older adults when the end users of the system are incorporated into the research process from start to finish. Therefore, Dr. Moreno proposes research in partnership with a large rural community/migrant health center in California's impoverished San Joaquin Valley that serves two counties and has 22 clinical sites. His community partner's patient population is 72 percent Latino which is significant given the current and projected increase of elderly Latinos over the next few decades. To this end, the specific aims that focus on adults � 60 years of age are: 1) to examine the prevalence and correlates of use of potentially inappropriate medications, 2) to examine how often there is suboptimal medication intensification of needed treatments for those with hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemias, 3) to identify provider, patient, and stakeholder barriers and facilitators (e.g. work flow issues and tailoring of message) to adoption of patient-centered health IT POC decision support designed to improve prescription drug management and safety, and 4) to adapt and develop a prototype of health IT POC decision support system for prescription drug management tailored to older adults with cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemias. Aims 1-3 will inform the development and the decision support content and targeted messaging that is proposed in Aim 4. This research forms the basis for an R01 application of an adequately powered randomized clinical trial of health IT POC decision support to improve medication management quality and safety for older adults across a regional community clinic network. Older adults are at increased risk of using potentially inappropriate medications and paradoxically of under using treatments known to improve control of cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure. Health information technology (HIT) decision support to improve medication management delivered electronically during the patient visit holds great potential for decreasing use of potentially inappropriate medications and increasing the use of beneficial treatments. This project is grounded in an established community-based approach that will systematically include feedback from physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and patients so that the medication decision support tools developed are widely accepted and address the most important barriers for safe prescribing for older adults with chronic conditions.",Health IT decision support to improve medication management safety and quality,9066101,K23AG042961,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Decision Making ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Faculty ', ' family medicine ', ' Family Practice ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incentives ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' Nurses ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Physicians ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Rural Community ', ' Medication Management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Safety Management ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' career development ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' one year old ', ' age 1 year ', ' 1 year old ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Health Informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' effectiveness research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' safety net ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' stem ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' implementation science ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' hypertension control ', ' health information technology ', ' economic implication ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' support tools ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2016,133233,0.08910945002387974
"Maximizing the Impact of ePHIM in Low-Income, Multiethnic Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to access, manage, and understand personal health information enables individuals to become  better consumers and participate more fully in making health care decisions.  The development of electronic health records and the availability of patient portals for accessing personal health records, coupled with myriad health information via the internet (eHealth), have provided the potential for electronic personal health information management (ePHIM).  However, great variability exists in access to eHealth information for components of the US population. Despite continuing efforts, this ""digital divide"" remains for rural, minority and low-income communities.  Limited access for ePHIM contributes to the health disparities experienced by these populations.  The goal of this project is to improve the ability of low-income African American, American Indian, Latino, and white older adults living in rural and urban communities to use information technology applications for ePHIM.  The project's conceptual framework combines the Technology Acceptance Model and the person- environmental interaction model.  It uses a community-based participatory partnership of Wake Forest School  of Medicine and its Outpatient Department Medicine Clinic, with Community Partners HealthNet, a network of  18 clinics serving 25 rural North Carolina counties, to achieve 3 specific aims:  (1) document the ePHIM  experience, knowledge, perceived needs, and perceived risks of low-income African American, American  Indian, Latino, and white older adults living in rural and urban communities~ (2) delineate the actual use of  ePHIM by low-income African American, American Indian, Latino, and white older adults living in rural and  urban communities~ and (3) delineate differences in perception, belief and experience in using ePHIM between  patients and caregivers who use versus those who do not use ePHIM.  This project is significant because it will delineate disparities in ePHIM by working with two networks of clinics (Community Partners HealthNet~ Outpatient Department Medicine Clinic/Wake Forest Baptist Health) that provides care to rural and urban, low- income, and minority patients.  Working with these networks, this project will implement in-depth and longitudinal research that will delineate the factors affecting ePHIM use among vulnerable elders.  This project is innovative.  (1)  It will use qualitative data collection techniques within a community-based participatory research framework to assess the motives and barriers to patients' and caregivers' ePHIM among rural as well as urban, low-income, older adult, and minority communities.  (2) It emphasizes the importance of including caregivers, particularly for older adults, in understanding the use of ePHIM.   (3) It will use these qualitative methods to assess the perceptions of health care providers and IT providers about the potential use of ePHIM.   (4) It will use these qualitative methods to determine the factors that facilitated and limited the use of ePHIM by comparing high / expert, medium, and low users.  (5) It will document the actual pattern of ePHIM use among older adults and their caregivers over a one-year period.  (6) It will explore the association of ePHIM use and chronic disease management among older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to access, manage and understand personal health information enables individuals to become better consumers and to participate more fully in making health care decisions.  Within a conceptual framework and using a community-based participatory partnership, this project will delineate the factors that facilitate or limit the useof electronic personal health information management (ePHIM).","Maximizing the Impact of ePHIM in Low-Income, Multiethnic Populations",9107795,R01HS021679,[''],AHRQ,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,497875,0.10514301017069506
"Evaluating disparities in older adult health, institutionalization, and mortality after implementation of Medicaid's Balancing Incentives Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Formal, or paid long term service and support (LTSS) have estimated annual costs of $211 to $306 billion in the U.S. and these expenditures are expected to rise as Baby Boomers age. Demographic trends including smaller family sizes, increased female workforce participation, and longer lifespans will reduce the availability of family caregivers, placing further burden on the formal LTSS system and especially on Medicaid, the nation's largest single payer of formal LTSS. Medicaid has been at the forefront of policy efforts to ""rebalance"" LTSS from institutional to home-and community-based settings. These rebalancing efforts reflect individuals' preferences to receive home- and community-based services (HCBS) and these transitions have also been shown to save about 15% in per capita LTSS spending over 10 years. In spite of this increased focus, evaluations of these rebalancing policies have largely neglected health and mortality outcomes, disparities in outcomes, and effects on older adults with specific health conditions such as dementia, who may have higher than average Medicaid expenditures. The most recently implemented rebalancing policy is the Balancing Incentive Program (BIP), which offers additional funding to states to increase access to LTSS in states that were spending less than 50% of LTSS expenditures on HCBS. We will conduct the first formal evaluation of BIP's effects on four health outcomes: self-rated health, functioning, long-term institutionalization, and mortality. There is reason to suspect that disparities in these outcomes may also be affected after BIP's implementation, as whites and minorities tend to employ very different LTSS strategies and have different levels of access to care. Similarly, individuals living in rural areas are more likey than their urban counterparts to have few or distant medical providers and fragmented care coordination, all of which limit their ability to obtain necessary care and adversely affect individual and population health outcomes. This proposal employs a mixed-method approach to (1) conduct qualitative analyses to identify states' BIP implementation stages and challenges; (2) test the effect of BIP implementation on the four health outcomes using a difference-in- difference approach that capitalizes on the quasi-experimental framework to compare states that did and did not (but were eligible to) implement BIP; (3) assess racial/ethnic and rural/urban differences in BIP's effects on health; and (4) examine whether health conditions and access to informal care (unpaid care generally provided by family), and county- or state-level access to formal care further modify the effects of BIP on health outcomes and disparities. Multiple administrative and survey databases spanning 2008-2017 will be merged to examine health outcomes for dual-eligible adults 65 years and older who live in BIP and non-BIP states. The goal of this study is to provide policymakers with rigorous analyses of BIP's effects on health and health disparities. While these analyses focus on BIP, the results have implications for HCBS more generally and for understanding how rebalancing policies influence health and health disparities in older adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal evaluates the U.S.'s most recent long-term services and supports (LTSS) rebalancing policy, the Balancing Incentive Program (BIP), which bolsters participating states' ability to increase access to care in home- and community-based settings. We will examine how BIP implementation influences older adults' self- reported health, functioning measured by activities of daily living, risk of long-term institutionalization, and ris of mortality. Further, we test whether BIP implementation reduces or exacerbates existing racial/ethnic and rural/urban disparities in these outcomes. We also examine whether these effects vary by an individual's health conditions, access to informal (unpaid) care from family members, and access to formal (paid) care at the county and state levels.            ","Evaluating disparities in older adult health, institutionalization, and mortality after implementation of Medicaid's Balancing Incentives Program",9008826,R01MD010360,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Family Sizes ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Incentives ', ' Institutionalization ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Social Policies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Urban Health ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' patient home care ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' single payer ', ' Single-Payer System ', ' Staging ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Distant ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' 65+ years old ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' success ', ' Stretching ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' dual eligible ', ' community based service ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' waiver ', ' informal care ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2016,851575,0.06624980533366984
"Suicide Prevention in Chinese Older Adults This two-site (Rush University and Northwestern University) linked re-submission of R34MH100443 collaborative application aims to design a culturally tailored and communityengaged intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts in US Chinese older adults, who have the highest suicide rate than any other racial/ethnic groups. Despite this health disparity, we have great paucity in our understanding of cultural issues surrounding suicide in Chinese populations, and this has directly hampered the intervention efforts. Accordingly, we seek to support a geriatrician (Dong) with expertise in aging, mental health and Chinese culture, and an interventionist (Simon) with expertise in clinical trials using community health workers to reduce health disparities among minority populations. More specifically, we aim to 1) expand synergistic academic and community partnerships; 2) iteratively design and refine a culturally meaningful pilot intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts; 3) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial; and 4) rigorously evaluate the cultural acceptability of the proposed intervention at multiple levels. This study will set the cornerstone for the next R01 application to fully test the efficacy of a culturally tailored intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts in Chinese aging populations.    By 2030, Chinese older adults will account for a quarter of the world's aging populations. Despite the rapid growth of Chinese populations in the US, there are marked health disparities among Chinese older adults, which are further exacerbated by the complex linguistic and cultural nuances in studying Chinese populations, particularly on issues of suicidal thoughts. Moreover, there has been inadequate and sustainable community support necessary to empower the Chinese community to be fully engaged as equal partners in research. In this application, a bilingual and bicultural principal investigator and an interdisciplinary investigative team have leveraged the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR), building on our prior NIH funded CBPR projects to partner synergistically and sustainably with the Chicago Chinese community in order to overcome these challenges and set the foundation for this proposal. The study findings will inform clinicians, investigators, communities, social services and policy makers to: a) improve our in-depth understanding of cultural issues surrounding suicide; b) empower community to be equal partners in mental health research ; c) guide the next R01 intervention study; and d) inform practice and policy on suicide care in Chinese older adults. Public Health Relevance:  This R34 resubmission will collaborative and iteratively design and refine a culturally adapted intervention to reduce the frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts in Chinese older adults. This has implication for investigators, clinicians, community, social services and policy makers to reduce suicide in Chinese older adults. This two-site (Rush University and Northwestern University) linked re-submission of R34MH100443 collaborative application aims to design a culturally tailored and communityengaged intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts in US Chinese older adults, who have the highest suicide rate than any other racial/ethnic groups. Despite this health disparity, we have great paucity in our understanding of cultural issues surrounding suicide in Chinese populations, and this has directly hampered the intervention efforts. Accordingly, we seek to support a geriatrician (Dong) with expertise in aging, mental health and Chinese culture, and an interventionist (Simon) with expertise in clinical trials using community health workers to reduce health disparities among minority populations. More specifically, we aim to 1) expand synergistic academic and community partnerships; 2) iteratively design and refine a culturally meaningful pilot intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts; 3) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial; and 4) rigorously evaluate the cultural acceptability of the proposed intervention at multiple levels. This study will set the cornerstone for the next R01 application to fully test the efficacy of a culturally tailored intervention to reduce suicidal thoughts in Chinese aging populations.

"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose here our overall plan for the Health Promotion Research Center (HPRC) at the University of Washington for the next five years. One of the original three Prevention Research Centers funded by CDC in 1986, HPRC focuses on promoting healthy aging and reducing health disparities among adults aged 50 and older. Building on our 15 years of experience conducting dissemination and implementation research aimed at scale-up of effective interventions, we plan to focus our work in three areas: cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion.  Specifically, we will expand the national reach of three flagship healthy-aging programs that were developed and tested by HPRC and disseminated by community organizations partnering with HPRC. First is EnhanceFitness, a group-exercise program for older adults. Since 1999, Senior Services, a Seattle-based non- profit organization serving older adults, has disseminated EnhanceFitness to more than 500 community sites in more than 30 states. It has reached more than 25,000 older adults, most of whom are low-income or members of racial and ethnic minorities. Second is PEARLS, a depression-management program delivered in community settings. Since 2003, Area Agencies on Aging have delivered PEARLS to more than 2,000 low-income, largely fragile and home-bound older adults with depression, through 45 sites in 14 states. Third is Workplace Solutions, a package of evidence-based cancer prevention practices for the workplace. Since 2003, the American Cancer Society has disseminated Workplace Solutions to more than 1,600 workplaces with 6.9 million employees in 42 states.  Scale-up of the EnhanceFitness program, with a focus on reducing race/ethnicity-related disparities in arthritis suffering, will be the objective of our Core Researh Project. In 2011, Senior Services licensed EnhanceFitness to YMCA of the USA (Y-USA), the national-network office for more than 2,700 YMCAs. Because EnhanceFitness decreases pain and increases mobility for persons with arthritis, Y-USA will focus its EnhanceFitness implementation on the half of older adults who suffer from arthritis. Older adults are much more likely to participate in a community-based program like EnhanceFitness if it is recommended by a health care provider, so Y-USA has asked for HPRC's help in enhancing its current, limited approach to increasing provider recommendations for EnhanceFitness participation. To do so, we will first conduct formative research with pharmacists and physical therapists to learn the most effective means of increasing recommendations to a community-based program like EnhanceFitness. Second, we will develop an enhanced approach tailored to obtaining recommendations by pharmacists, physical therapists, and primary-care providers for participation of older-adult arthritis patients in EnhanceFitness at YMCAs. Third, we will conduct a cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness and the cost of the current and enhanced approaches. HPRC's three healthy-aging focus areas - cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion - address many of the biggest health problems among middle- aged and older adults. Our research is aimed at national expansion of HPRC's three evidence-based healthy- aging programs: EnhanceFitness, which increases physical activity and preserves functioning; PEARLS, which reduces depression; and Workplace Solutions/HealthLinks, which increases employers' use of evidence-based practices to prevent chronic illnesses. These programs all have a record of success in reaching underserved, diverse populations at disparate risk for chronic diseases and related disability and mortality.",Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center,9324389,U48DP005013,[''],NCCDPHP,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U48,2016,448646,0.14100159479345614
"Living Well Together: A Chronic Disease Self-Management Program for Older African Americans with Chronic Illness ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic cardiovascular (CV) conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia in midlife increase the risk for dementia. The African American community bears a disproportionate amount of chronic disease burden, and continues to face disparities across the healthcare spectrum. Improved control of CV risk factors improves both physical and cognitive health, and may provide a means to reducing dementia risk, but evidence shows that difficulty with adherence to treatment recommendations is common. Health self- management programs such as the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) are designed to addressthis issue by increasing participant health self-efficacy, though few studies have specifically focused on the experiences of African American participants. The overall objective of the proposed study is to identify key elements influencing participation and engagement in a sample of older African American adults with chronic illness who either completed, withdrew, or declined to participate in a modified version of the CDSMP called Living Well Together (LWT). It is hypothesized that the unique modifications of the LWT program positively impacted participation and engagement in this sample. The study proposes to test this hypothesis through a comparison of attendance and attrition rates between the two programs, and identification and description of key facilitating and complicating factors associated with program engagement and attrition, as well as an exploration of the sustained effects on health behaviors. A mixed methods approach will be used to gain insight into the experiences and perspectives of LWT participants and program leaders, and this information will be used to inform the design, development and testing of future interventions targeting healthy aging for minority adults. The long term goal of this study is to address health disparitie in aging and neurodegenerative diseases through improved management of CV risk factors earlier in life, and is in alignment with National Institute of Health and Centers for Disease Control priorities on promoting healthy aging and reducing health disparities in chronic illness.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Understanding the key factors that encourage or discourage engagement and participation in health self- management programs is critical to improving the health of older adults with chronic diseases. The proposed study targets older African American adults with chronic illness in order to understand the specific needs of this population, increase engagement and maintenance of healthy behaviors, and reduce health disparities in chronic illness and dementia.        ",Living Well Together: A Chronic Disease Self-Management Program for Older African Americans with Chronic Illness,9093204,R36AG052599,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Behavior ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Elements ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hypercholesteremia ', ' hypercholesterolemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Interview ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' enhancing factor ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neuro-degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' behavior change ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' treatment planning ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' healthy aging ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' health inequalities ', ' shared decision making ', ' family support ', ' racial health disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R36,2016,66365,0.015826797554923496
"Engagement in Care of Older, Rural HIV+ Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION: HIV-positive adults who live in rural areas suffer from greater mortality than non-rural HIV-infected individuals and face unique challenges to maintaining good health. This disparity in health outcomes is not well understood, yet remains significant because a sizeable number of HIV-positive individuals live in rural areas. To minimize morbidity and mortality, all HIV-positive individuals must remain engaged in care and adherent to antiretroviral medications over the course of their lives. Services such as expert HIV care, case management, mental health care, and antiretroviral adherence support can improve health outcomes for HIV-infected individuals, but may be unavailable or more difficult to access for individuals living in rural ares. Additional factors challenge rural HIV-infected individuals, including transportation, social isolation, increased stigma, higher rates of depression, and more maladaptive coping mechanisms. As the HIV population in the US ages-more than half of HIV-infected individuals in the US will be over age 50 by 2015-access to medical care and ancillary services will become increasingly important to maintain good health outcomes. While the individual sets of challenges of aging with HIV and living with HIV in a rural environment are each significant, older HIV-positive individuals who live in rural areas face a doubly difficult set of challenges to achieving good health outcomes. Currently, little is known about the factors that affect (1) engagement in HIV-related care, and (2) health-related quality of life among older, rural HIV-positive adults. This project will elucidate the unique personal, social, and structural factors tht affect health-related quality of life and engagement in medical care among older, rural HIV-positive adults and determine the effect of these factors on health outcomes. To accomplish these goals, this project will use a mixed-methods approach. During the formative, qualitative phase of the study, in-depth individual interviews will be conducted with approximately 40 HIV-positive adults over the age of 50 who live in rural areas of the US. These interviews will elucidate the personal, psychosocial, medical, structural, geographic, and demographic factors that affect perceived quality of life as well as engagement in medical care. Using data from the formative phase of the study, a survey will be constructed to measure (1) the prevalence of each factor in a large sample; (2) which factors are associated with engagement in medical care and quality of life; and (3) the degree to which each factor is associated with these outcomes. During this phase of the study, 400 HIV-positive adults over age 50 who live in rural areas throughout the US will complete this survey. Analyses of survey data will determine the specific needs of this population, and the factors that have the greatest effect on quality of life and engagement in medical care. This project will yield data which is of great public health significance, as it will demonstrate the current needs of this population of US HIV-positive individuals that suffer from greater mortality and will serve as a basis from which to develop interventions to improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities for this population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than half of the US HIV population will be over age 50 by 2015. Maintaining engagement in HIV medical care is critical, yet challenging for individuals aging with HIV. Older HIV-infected individuals who live in rural areas face even greater challenges to staying engaged in medical care and suffer higher rates of mortality than urban individuals. This project will yield data that will demonstrate the personal, social, and structura needs of older, rural HIV-positive individuals and will serve as a basis from which to develop interventions to improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities for this population.","Engagement in Care of Older, Rural HIV+ Adults",9054758,R21AG048675,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Social isolation ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Transportation ', ' Measures ', ' Case Management ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Managed Care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dependence ', ' Perceived quality of life ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' coping mechanism ', ' ancillary care ', ' cognitive ability ', ' informal caregiver ', ' Informal care giver ', ' Formal caregiver ', ' Formal care giver ', ' ']",NIA,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2016,230750,0.028808903327125327
"Reducing disability via a bundled bio-behavioral-environmental approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disability in older adults is a major public health problem, particularly among low-income urban people of color. Most disabled older adults strongly prefer to live at home, but many require nursing home admission due to limitation in basic or instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs or IADLs). Since these costly admissions are preventable, testing novel, cost-effective interventions to improve ADLs should be a public health priority. Previous research has not comprehensively addressed individuals and the environment in which they function yet low income older adults suffer from health disparities in both their function and their home environments. We propose a two-group randomized trial to test the efficacy of our bio-behavioral-environmental intervention, Community Aging in Place - Advancing Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE), which combines evidence-based nursing, occupational therapy, and handyman components. In a randomized controlled pilot trial, the CAPABLE intervention had preliminary effect sizes of 0.63 and 0.62 for reducing difficulty in ADLs and IADLs respectively, when comparing the mean changes in the intervention group to the control group from baseline to follow up. These pilot findings warrant an efficacy trial. We will recruit low-income older (eage 65), principally African-American, adults with e 1 ADL or e 2 IADL limitations from the Baltimore Department of Housing Energy Assistance Program. We will interview them at home and randomize participants to either the treatment (CAPABLE intervention) or control (attention-control) group. Participants in the treatment group will receiv up to 10 in-home sessions -- d6 visits with an occupational therapist and d4 visits from a nurse - and d$1200 in safety and modification services from a licensed handyman. Each treatment participant will receive each intervention component but interventionists will systematically tailo content to the participants' risk profile and goals based on protocols. Participants in the control group will receive an equivalent number of visits, which will consist of sedentary activities with  trained research assistant (RA). All participants will be reassessed at 16 and 52 weeks in person by an RA masked to treatment condition. The primary endpoint is the ability to complete ADLs and IADLs without difficulty at 16 weeks post-randomization. Other endpoints include lower extremity mobility, health-related quality of life, and home safety at 16 weeks and ADL and IADL limitations at 52 weeks post-randomization. We will examine moderators of treatment success and mediating mechanisms. We will also evaluate cost-effectiveness based on the cost of the intervention and health care utilization. The study is designed to detect clinically meaningful improvement in ADL or IADL limitations between the intervention and control group with 80 percent power (alpha = 0.05) in an intention to treat analysis. The innovative study will provide economic evidence for a theory-driven intervention that could rein in costs of a growing and increasingly diverse older adult population. Disability in older adults is a major public health problem, particularly among low-income, urban people of color. Most adults with disabilities strongly prefer to live at home, but many have difficulty taking care of themselves. This study proposes to test the efficacy of a newly developed bio- behavioral-environmental intervention, Community Aging in Place - Advancing Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE), which combines evidence-based nursing, occupational therapy, and handyman components to help low income older adults function at home and save our nation costly nursing home care.",Reducing disability via a bundled bio-behavioral-environmental approach,9042913,R01AG040100,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Attention ', ' Baltimore ', ' Budgets ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Exercise ', ' Expenditure ', ' Goals ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Masks ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Occupational Therapist ', ' Occupational Therapy ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Medication Management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Licensing ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' R.N.

Third, we will conduct a cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness and the cost of the current and enhanced approaches.                  HPRC's three healthy-aging focus areas - cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion - address many of the biggest health problems among middle- aged and older adults. Our research is aimed at national expansion of HPRC's three evidence-based healthy- aging programs: EnhanceFitness, which increases physical activity and preserves functioning; PEARLS, which reduces depression; and Workplace Solutions/HealthLinks, which increases employers' use of evidence-based practices to prevent chronic illnesses.

"Racial Differences in Decision Making among Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Decision making in financial and health matters is of critical importance for maintaining independence and wellbeing in old age, and recent work in predominately older White adults suggests decision making worsens with age. While there is a paucity of knowledge regarding decision making in older Black adults, preliminary studies suggest there may be differences in decision making by race. Decision making can be viewed as a complex interaction of externally influenced contextual factors with two internal systems: a cognitive processing system and an affective processing system. Although racial differences in cognitive processing have been well documented, little is known about racial differences in other components of decision making, and these could have profound economic and public health consequences for a diverse range of older adults. The overall goal of this study is to elucidate racial differences in decision making among older adults and to identify the contextual factors, affective factors, and neurobiological mechanisms that drive them. Contextual factors, such as acquired financial and health literacy, socioeconomic status (SES), and perceived discrimination, vary by race, are often influenced by adverse social and environmental experiences over the life course, and could have important mediating effects between race and decision making. Life course experiences also shape internally modulated affective processes. Since differences in decision making are observed when affective processes interact with cognitive processes, affective factors such as trust, risk aversion, and loneliness could have important moderating effects on decision making by race. Both contextual and affective factors have recently been shown to impact the functional architecture of brain networks, revealing important insights into the neural systems involved in decision making. Regrettably, these findings have been almost exclusively in White persons; thus there is a dearth of knowledge regarding the neural correlates of decision making in Black persons. Racial differences in contextual and affective factors experienced over the life course may result in variability in the organization of functional brain systems. However, it is unknown how or whether any putative differences in functional neural network architecture may drive racial differences in decision making. Finally, Black adults are at greater risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our recent work has implicated poor decision making as a potential risk factor for AD in White adults; however, it is unknown whether and to what extent poor decision making is a risk for AD in Black adults. The proposed study will leverage existing clinical data from nondemented older Blacks and Whites participating in the Minority Aging Research Study (RF1AG022018), the Rush Clinical Core (P3010161), and an ongoing study of decision making in aging (R01AG033678) to collect new behavioral decision making and neuroimaging data among older Black adults. Knowledge of racial differences in decision making and the associated factors that drive them will provide crucial information for identifying potentially modifiable targets for intervention to address health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this study is to elucidate racial differences in decision making among older adults and to identify the contextual factors, affective factors, and neurobiological mechanisms that drive them.

"Education and Aging: transitions from multi-morbidity to functional limitations Project Summary The central theme of this application is the effect of education on health at older ages, specifically multimorbidity and its association with disability. Differences in morbidity and mortality as a function of education constitute one of the most consistent findings of epidemiologic research. The effects of education extend into old age as evident in inequalities in functional impairment, disability, and life expectancy. Recent data suggest that ongoing increases in life expectancy are accompanied by widening of educational differences in life expectancy and disability. We identify multiple chronic conditions due to aging of populations and poor understanding of their impact on functioning trajectories and disability as critical to understanding the effects of education on health at older ages. The cross-sectional nature of much of the research on multimorbidity and disability does not allow identification of prevention targets that could be used to close the gap in health stats of older adults. The overall aim of this application is to examine the effects of education on health at older ages using a longitudinal study design, with a follow-up spanning the entire adult lifecourse. Our proposal is based on the Whitehall II study which has pioneered research on health inequalities. The specific focus of the current proposal is multimorbidity, with chronic diseases assessed using gold standard measures and its impact on functioning trajectories, using both measured and reported functioning. A range of psychosocial, behavioral, and biological pathways will be examined. An advantage of our study is comprehensive data on socioeconomic trajectory subsequent to education, allowing estimation of effects of education independent of this pathway. Non-response in the study is low and linkage to electronic health records for all participants, irrespective of their continued participation is a further advantage. We propose to examine education based inequalities in multimorbidity and underlying mechanisms (AIM 1), assess the associations and mechanisms that explain education related differences in measured and reported functioning trajectories and disability over the adult lifecourse (AIM 2), and examine whether education buffers the effect of multimorbidity on disability at older ages and identify underlying mechanisms (AIM 3). Our overarching hypothesis is that multimorbidity and suboptimal control of risk factors explain the greater burden of disability in lower education groups. Health promotion can ensure that older people with chronic conditions and disabilities remain active and independent, preventing institutionalization and declining health. The improvements in life expectancy and disability rates in the high education groups suggests that it is possible to extend these all population groups to ensure that most older people remain healthy, active, and independent for as long as possible. In order to do this, a better understanding of the pathways through which education affects health at older ages is needed; evidence that this proposal aims to generate. Project Narrative Educational inequalities in health are ubiquitous and even high income countries, including those with universal health coverage, show strong links between education and health that extend into old age. We propose to study the association of education to multimorbidity and disability at older ages. Our primary aim is to identify psychosocial, behavioral, and biologic mechanisms that explain these associations to allow evidence based prevention and public health policies. Improvements over time in the health status of those in high education groups suggest that it is possible to close the gap in health across population subgroups.",Education and Aging: transitions from multi-morbidity to functional limitations,9565689,R56AG056477,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Buffers ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Leisure Activities ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Personality ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Inequality ', ' Attenuated ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' cognitive function ', ' Country ', ' Physical Function ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Occupational ', ' psychosocial ', ' functional status ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' behavioral health ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Population Group ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' disability burden ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' standard measure ', ' health inequalities ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON,R56,2017,365201,0.037915644707539206
"Cohort differences in social life and health:  Refreshing the NSHAP sample DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP) is a longitudinal study of older adults designed to examine the mechanisms by which social factors-such as intimate relationships and social networks-affect and are affected by health. In 2005-06, questionnaire and biomeasure data were collected from a nationally- representative sample of 3,005 community-dwelling adults ages 57-85 (W1). These referent respondents were reinterviewed in 2010-11, together with coresident spouses/partners (W2). A third wave (W3), to be collected in 2015-16, will reinterview all surviving referent respondents and W2 spouses/partners. Collectively, NSHAP's W1, W2 and W3 provide extensive, longitudinal, health and social information for a nationally representative sample of older adults. We aim to add a new cohort to the NSHAP sample to capture the unique and epidemiologically intriguing ""Baby Boom"" cohort. Funding for refreshing the sample with a new cohort of aging ""Baby Boomers"" (i.e., respondents born from 1948 through 1965) will substantially increase the value of NSHAP for various research communities, opening up key avenues for conducting innovative and effective health related research, such as: (1) comparing the social connections, networks, environment and relationships of older adults in different birth cohorts and the relationship of these social factors with health; (2) tracing cohort differences in the life courseof cohabitations and marital relationships; (3) comparing trajectories of physical function, self-rate health, health behaviors, prevalence of chronic diseases, and physiological functioning across ages over birth cohorts; (4) tracking the transition from middle-age to older ages; and (5) capturing racial and ethnic differences in the ages at which relevant chronic conditions become prevalent across cohorts.  Funding will support adding over 2,500 respondents. The addition of respondents ages 50 to 67 in 2015- 16 will provide a nationally-representative, high-quality data set on social relationships and health for ages 50 to 95, setting the stage for a sequential cohort design. The addition of the Baby Boom cohort will allow researchers to compare health and social outcomes along age, period, and cohort axes. We will harmonize data collection with W3 of NSHAP to form a single, cohesive dataset, including in-home interviews with 1,600 new respondents born between 1948-1965 and their spouses or co-residential romantic partners (n=900). This will yield extensive, nationally representative, self-reported and biomeasure data on multiple cohorts' physical and mental health, physical and cognitive functioning, medication use, and pathways of health and mortality within social contexts, facilitating comparative assessments of health disparities between gender, race, ethnicity and socio- economic status by age within and across cohorts.

"University of Florida Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the University of Florida Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) is twofold: 1) to optimize older persons' physical performance and mobility through interdisciplinary approaches; and 2) to train new investigators in aging and disability research while developing their leadership qualities. Our goal is to enhance late-life health and independence, with a special focus on mobility. To accomplish our mission, our strategy is to attract studies and inventive investigators from diverse behavioral, clinical, basic, and technological science disciplines with a common research focus: “mobility and prevention of disability.” Traversing the entire spectrum of biomedical investigation, including molecular biology, animal studies, clinical research, behavioral sciences, epidemiology, and engineering, our research effort addresses the OAIC's general goal: to increase scientific knowledge that leads to better ways to maintain or restore independence of older people. Our research objectives are to: 1) assess, using translational research (among diverse disciplines), the biological, co-morbid, psychosocial, behavioral, and other factors that contribute to physical function decline, loss of mobility, and progression toward disability; and 2) develop and reliably test, in clinical and preclinical studies, interventions that target mobility to prevent, delay, or recover the age-related declines in physical function. Our educational objective is to train future leaders in clinical translational research on aging. To meet these objectives the proposed OAIC trains Junior Scholars and supports investigators, resources, services, external studies, development projects, and pilot/exploratory studies through seven integrated cores:  • Leadership and Administrative Core;  • Research Education Core;  • Pilot/Exploratory Studies Core;  • Clinical Research Core;  • Metabolism and Translational Science Core;  • Biostatistics Core; and  • Data Science and Applied Technology Core.  A relevant strength of the proposed OAIC is the concerted action of the interdisciplinary cores, projects, and investigators who address one common research focus spanning the entire spectrum of biomedical investigation.

"Epidemiology of Psychological Distress in a Chinese Aging Population This goal of our project is to conduct an epidemiological study to elucidate the relationship between culture factors and psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults. More specifically, we will examine the trajectory of psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults, to quantify the relation between normative responsibilities with their psychological wellbeing, to quantify the degree of influence to which normative responsibilities influences health-related factors associated with psychological wellbeing, and to examine the gender differences. Our secondary aims are to explore the feasibilities of testing the inter-relations between subjective and physiological measures of psychological wellbeing; and to explore the socio-cultural context in the normative responsibilities. Chinese aging population is increasing rapidly in US and globally. However, there are marked health disparities, especially surround the issues of psychological wellbeing, suicide, violence and elder mistreatment (elder abuse, neglect, financial exploitation and self-neglect). In addition, there are linguistic and cultural complexities and nuances when studying these issues. Moreover, there has been inadequate grass-root support necessary to empower and enable the Chinese communities to fully participate in the research process as equal partners on culturally sensitive issues. Accordingly, we will build on our prior community-based participatory research to quantify the mechanisms between important cultural factors and the trajectory of psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults. In this application, a culturally capable principal investigator and a multi-institutional interdisciplinary team will build on our prior efforts to collaborate with Chinese community organizations. The findings from this proposal could inform health care professionals, researcher, community, and policy makers to identify risk/protective factors, better understand disease pathway, inform future prevention and intervention studies, and inform the practice and policy to improve psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults. Public Health Relevance:  This proposal will conduct an epidemiological study to quantify the trajectory of older adult's psychological wellbeing and to examine factors associated with filial responsibilities, family conflict, and psychological wellbeing in Chinese older men and women.

"Addressing Disparities in Healthcare Access and Outcomes among Chronically Ill Older Adults: Assessing the Feasibility of an Agent-Based Modeling Approach Project Summary Prior research shows persistently greater burden of illness and poorer access to care among racial minorities and low-income individuals; older adults with chronic illness are no exception. Although evidence on the social determinants of health has grown, many questions remain about the complex interplay of individual, organizational, and environmental factors in health disparities generally, and in healthcare access and outcomes in particular. This developmental study will assess the feasibility of using a state-of-the-art systems science method – Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) – to examine and address the complex array of factors contributing to racial and socio-economic disparities in healthcare access and outcomes among chronically ill older adults. We will capitalize on an existing dataset that includes three years of health care claims on a cohort of 278,820 New York City-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 and older with diabetes, heart failure and/or hypertension linked with data on neighborhood characteristics (e.g. supply of primary care and federally qualified health centers, neighborhood walkability, and transit access). Applying ABMS to the existing data could establish the groundwork for developing a decision-support tool to guide interventions in health disparities; however, it is essential to first identify the most influential factors in each level of analysis and how they interact. Focusing on the three levels of analysis needed to build a prototype agent-based model, the specific aims are to assess the feasibility of:  (1) developing an individual-level agent model with the available data on demographics (e.g. race, age, low  income), diagnoses, patterns of outpatient healthcare use and outcomes (e.g. hospitalizations for  ambulatory care-sensitive conditions, emergency department visits);  (2) modeling the organization of health services across the care continuum by combining data on  sequencing and intensity of service delivery and health care supply; and  (3) developing a neighborhood-level model that includes socio-demographic composition, walkability, public  transit, safety, amenities and social services as environmental determinants of healthcare access and outcomes. This study will determine whether agent-based modeling is feasible for capturing the multiple dimensions of phenomena that influence healthcare access and outcomes among vulnerable populations. This work would lay a foundation for a larger study that includes simulation of promising interventions using an expanded dataset that could include both Medicare and Medicaid claims for services delivered since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a model that serves as a decision support tool to guide policy and practice interventions at the provider and/or community level to improve the health of underserved populations of older adults with chronic illness and, in turn, reduce health disparities. Project Narrative Among the growing numbers of older adults with chronic illness, racial minorities and low-income individuals frequently have poorer access to care and worse health outcomes overall. This developmental study will assess the feasibility of using an advanced method – Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) – to investigate the complex factors contributing to racial and socio-economic disparities in the health of older adults with chronic illness. The long-term goal of this research to develop a decision support tool that can be used by policymakers and health care administrators to guide interventions to improve the health of underserved populations of older adults with chronic illness and, in turn, reduce health disparities.",Addressing Disparities in Healthcare Access and Outcomes among Chronically Ill Older Adults: Assessing the Feasibility of an Agent-Based Modeling Approach,9243577,R21AG053542,"['Adoption ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Influentials ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Policy Making ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Organizational Models ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' cohort ', ' simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Calendar ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' beneficiary ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' community based care ', ' demographics ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' social health determinants ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' urgent care ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' support tools ', ' walkability ', ' walkable ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,R21,2017,257546,0.1361952625996139
"Activity Space, Social Interaction and Health Trajectories in Later Life ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central goal of this research program is to describe the social and spatial environments in which older adults spend their time. We focus on the extent to which this activity space influences health trajectories. We theorize that the components of the person-environment relationship, including household, neighborhood, and network contexts, are interrelated and mutually constituted. We aim to 1) describe the activity space that older adults inhabit, and 2) explore the extent to which activity space, and the network, household, and neighborhood exposures related to it, affect short-term and pre-clinical changes in health. We will collect primary, multi-wave data from 600 Chicagoans aged 65 and older. We incorporate reports of network connectedness and activity tracking across physical space using GPS methodology. By equipping respondents with smart phones, we are able to collect real-time data on latitude, longitude and distance traveled. We use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology to obtain respondents' reports of their social settings, health status, health behaviors, and well- being. In-person interviews will obtain self-reported and objective indices of health, including body mass index and a salivary measure to assess chronic stress exposure. A particularly innovative feature of this study is the ability to capture changes n quotidian symptoms, potentially indicative of chronic disease onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tracking older adults' movements-in, out of, and across their communities-will provide insight into their span of engagement, the contexts most relevant for their health and well-being, and their access to social and community resources. These dynamic data, coupled with frequent multi-dimensional health assessments, combine to form an unprecedented opportunity to examine the mechanisms through which social context affects health across time.","Activity Space, Social Interaction and Health Trajectories in Later Life",9337334,R01AG050605,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Attention ', ' Chicago ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Household ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methodology ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Saliva ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Socialization ', ' Sociology ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Body Measures ', ' Body measure procedure ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Fostering ', ' Inequality ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Physical assessment ', ' Respondent ', ' Attenuated ', ' Nature ', ' Empirical Research ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Salivary ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' respiratory ', ' Services ', ' cohesion ', ' family structure ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Consequentialism ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' social engagement ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' data resource ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL OPINION RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2017,566955,0.08420753494363625
"Access to Community Based Palliative Care among Medically-Underserved Older Adults ABSTRACT Exploring the palliative care needs of medically underserved older adults  in East and Central Harlem As Americans live longer and the proportion of people 65 years of age and older grows from 14% of the population to 20% by midcentury, the growing incidence of age-related chronic illnesses will increasingly represent a critical public health concern. An estimated 80% of older adults have one chronic illness or condition (e.g., cancer, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias), and half of older adults experience two or more of these conditions. Chronic conditions are frequently accompanied by high symptom burden, including pain, fatigue, mobility problems, anxiety and depression, which are associated with diminished self-rated health and quality of life, frequent use of costly healthcare services, and ultimately threaten the ability to live independently. Palliative care has emerged as an effective strategy to address the profound human and economic costs of living with chronic and advanced illness. A substantial body of evidence suggests that delivering early, high-quality palliative care to this population significantly improves patient outcomes across critical domains by reducing pain and symptoms, enhancing patient and caregiver wellbeing, lengthening survival, and containing overall health care costs for the highest need users. Despite these promising outcomes, there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in access to high quality palliative care, particularly among older adults living in low-income communities. This longitudinal, mixed-method study explores the experiences and supportive care needs of community-dwelling chronically-ill African American and Latino older adults after discharge to the community from an inpatient palliative care service. The specific aims are to: 1) describe the needs and perceptions of chronically-ill, low- income African-American and Latino older adults living in the community, the conditions and contexts under which they access high quality palliative care, and the barriers they face in accessing and using palliative care post-discharge; 2) explore palliative care providers' perceptions of underserved older adults' needs for palliative care, and the strategies providers use to access these individuals and provide them with needed services; and 3) shed light on the mechanisms that explain palliative care disparities, and suggest strategies to advance culturally competent, measurable, and sustained improvements in coordination of comprehensive palliative care for community-dwelling African-American and Latino older adults. Overall, the study will advance our scientific understanding of palliative care disparities and help reduce multi-level barriers to meeting the needs of all community-dwelling older adults with chronic and advanced illness. Successful achievement of these aims will enhance our understanding of the barriers and facilitators to palliative care and suggest factors to expand these services to a growing population of underserved community-dwelling older adults. Findings from these exploratory data will form the basis of an R01 application to further develop and pilot innovative interventions to better meet the palliative care needs of chronically-ill, low-income African American and Latino older adults in the community. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE STATEMENT This study will contribute to the understanding of underlying causes of significant racial and ethnic disparities in access to and utilization of high-quality palliative care among community-dwelling, low-income African American and Latino older adults. Grounded in a multifactorial framework of micro-, mezzo- and macro-level influences, the study integrates community-based participatory research and grounded theory approaches to elicit the unique perspectives of ethnically diverse palliative care patients and palliative care providers at a public community hospital. An increased understanding of barriers and facilitators to palliative care will contribute to development of interventions that expand this critical resource to underserved community- dwelling older adults, thus addressing serious health disparities experienced by this population.",Access to Community Based Palliative Care among Medically-Underserved Older Adults,9208847,SC2GM121269,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Anxiety ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Communities ', ' Living Costs ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Palliative Care ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Palliative Medicine ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' advanced disease ', ' advanced illness ', ' economic cost ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' family support ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' pain symptom ', ' painful symptom ', ' ']",NIGMS,HUNTER COLLEGE,SC2,2017,156000,0.18873013883164058
"Mentoring Researchers in Advance Care Planning and Communication for Vulnerable Older Populations ABSTRACT The aims of this proposal are to (1) enable the candidate to further develop her research program focused on improving advance care planning (ACP) and informed medical decision making for vulnerable older adults and (2) use her research program as a platform for mentoring junior investigators interested in patient-oriented aging research, both within Geriatrics and other medical subspecialties. The candidate is a Geriatrician and Palliative Medicine physician who has established a high-impact independent clinical research program that is well funded with an outstanding publication record. In the 10 years since completing her Geriatrics fellowship, she has established herself as a successful mentor of students, fellows, and junior faculty who have published high-impact aging research, become successfully funded, and continue to participate in patient-oriented research in aging. The candidate has developed an extensive research portfolio focused on creating and testing literacy- and culturally appropriate health education materials to improve ACP and medical decision making for older adults. She developed a broader paradigm of ACP that focuses not only on one-time treatment decisions, such as for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but also on the process of preparing patients to communicate their wishes and to participate with clinicians in making real-time, complex medical decisions over the course of illness. She operationalized this paradigm into an easy-to-understand, patient- centered website called PREPARE that teaches patients, through videos, how to identify their wishes and communicate with surrogates and clinicians. The candidate received R01 funding from the NIA to test the efficacy of the PREPARE website to engage diverse, vulnerable older adults from an urban, county hospital in ACP using validated patient questionnaires. This K24 proposal will provide the candidate with protected time to expand her research in a new direction focused on direct observation (i.e., audio recording) of patient-clinician communication within primary care encounters in response to the PREPARE intervention. This new research will determine whether a patient-centered ACP website can empower and activate patients to discuss ACP and to facilitate communication with their primary care providers. The candidate will also develop her formal mentoring program with plans for the recruitment, selection, development, and evaluation of mentees who will become leaders in aging research. She will work with each mentee to establish a focused career development plan in which they complete research projects and develop the skills needed to become independent investigators. These plans will make full use of the outstanding clinical research training environment at UCSF. She will leverage her leadership positions at UCSF to recruit more mentees interested in research on ACP and aging in vulnerable populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will have unique public health importance because (1) it will increase mentoring of new clinical investigators interested in conducting patient-oriented research to improve advance care planning and patient- clinician communication for the rapidly growing elderly population, and (2) it will inform interventions to improve patient-clinician communication in the primary care setting, reduce health disparities in ACP, and result in diverse, older adults who are prepared for complex medical decision making.  ",Mentoring Researchers in Advance Care Planning and Communication for Vulnerable Older Populations,9211082,K24AG054415,"['Adoption ', ' advanced directive ', ' Advance Directives ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' heart resuscitation ', ' Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation ', ' Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Medical Education ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' County Hospitals ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Leadership ', ' literacy ', ' Mentors ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Palliative Medicine ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' empowerment ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Older Population ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' clinical care ', ' primary care setting ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' student mentoring ', ' student-led learning ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' disenfranchised population ', ' disenfranchised group ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2017,187880,0.027643986098015265
"Evaluating disparities in older adult health, institutionalization, and mortality after implementation of Medicaid's Balancing Incentives Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Formal, or paid long term service and support (LTSS) have estimated annual costs of $211 to $306 billion in the U.S. and these expenditures are expected to rise as Baby Boomers age. Demographic trends including smaller family sizes, increased female workforce participation, and longer lifespans will reduce the availability of family caregivers, placing further burden on the formal LTSS system and especially on Medicaid, the nation's largest single payer of formal LTSS. Medicaid has been at the forefront of policy efforts to ""rebalance"" LTSS from institutional to home-and community-based settings. These rebalancing efforts reflect individuals' preferences to receive home- and community-based services (HCBS) and these transitions have also been shown to save about 15% in per capita LTSS spending over 10 years. In spite of this increased focus, evaluations of these rebalancing policies have largely neglected health and mortality outcomes, disparities in outcomes, and effects on older adults with specific health conditions such as dementia, who may have higher than average Medicaid expenditures. The most recently implemented rebalancing policy is the Balancing Incentive Program (BIP), which offers additional funding to states to increase access to LTSS in states that were spending less than 50% of LTSS expenditures on HCBS. We will conduct the first formal evaluation of BIP's effects on four health outcomes: self-rated health, functioning, long-term institutionalization, and mortality. There is reason to suspect that disparities in these outcomes may also be affected after BIP's implementation, as whites and minorities tend to employ very different LTSS strategies and have different levels of access to care. Similarly, individuals living in rural areas are more likey than their urban counterparts to have few or distant medical providers and fragmented care coordination, all of which limit their ability to obtain necessary care and adversely affect individual and population health outcomes. This proposal employs a mixed-method approach to (1) conduct qualitative analyses to identify states' BIP implementation stages and challenges; (2) test the effect of BIP implementation on the four health outcomes using a difference-in- difference approach that capitalizes on the quasi-experimental framework to compare states that did and did not (but were eligible to) implement BIP; (3) assess racial/ethnic and rural/urban differences in BIP's effects on health; and (4) examine whether health conditions and access to informal care (unpaid care generally provided by family), and county- or state-level access to formal care further modify the effects of BIP on health outcomes and disparities. Multiple administrative and survey databases spanning 2008-2017 will be merged to examine health outcomes for dual-eligible adults 65 years and older who live in BIP and non-BIP states. The goal of this study is to provide policymakers with rigorous analyses of BIP's effects on health and health disparities. While these analyses focus on BIP, the results have implications for HCBS more generally and for understanding how rebalancing policies influence health and health disparities in older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal evaluates the U.S.'s most recent long-term services and supports (LTSS) rebalancing policy, the Balancing Incentive Program (BIP), which bolsters participating states' ability to increase access to care in home- and community-based settings. We will examine how BIP implementation influences older adults' self- reported health, functioning measured by activities of daily living, risk of long-term institutionalization, and ris of mortality. Further, we test whether BIP implementation reduces or exacerbates existing racial/ethnic and rural/urban disparities in these outcomes. We also examine whether these effects vary by an individual's health conditions, access to informal (unpaid) care from family members, and access to formal (paid) care at the county and state levels.","Evaluating disparities in older adult health, institutionalization, and mortality after implementation of Medicaid's Balancing Incentives Program",9265937,R01MD010360,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Family Sizes ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Incentives ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Policies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Urban Health ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' patient home care ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' single payer ', ' Single-Payer System ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Distant ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Gray unit of radiation dose ', ' Gray ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' success ', ' Stretching ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' dual eligible ', ' community based service ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' waiver ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' informal care ', ' urban residence ', ' urban disparity ', ' rural residence ', ' rural households ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2017,882840,0.06624980533366984
"End-of-Life in Assisted Living: Links between Structure, Process, and Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the demographic imperative of a rapidly aging population, a major challenge of the 21st century will be the growing prevalence of older adults who die from old age, most within the context of advanced chronic illness. Increasing numbers of these older adults will receive care and die in assisted living (AL), currently the fastest growing long-term care (LTC) option. The proposed five-year prospective qualitative study will investigate end-of-life (EOL) care in AL from the perspective of multiple stakeholders (residents, AL staff, informal caregivers, and external care providers, e.g., hospice workers). We will use a multifaceted multilevel conceptual framework and draw upon salient aspects of social ecological theory, Donabedian's structure- process-outcome (SPO) quality-of-care paradigm, relational theory, as well as domains of quality adapted from The National Consensus Project (NCP) Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care. The overall goal of the proposed research is to address critical knowledge gaps and identify best practices for EOL care in AL. The three specific aims are: (1) understand how EOL is defined and experienced by AL residents and other key stakeholders; (2) investigate the structure and process of formal and informal care in AL and understand the interface between these care components and how they shape outcomes; and (3) identify the contexts and conditions within which structures and processes of care are shaped and understand the combined impact these aspects of care have on stakeholders' overall EOL experience. Increasingly, LTC scholars and policy-makers are calling for a broader definition of EOL that encompasses different EOL transitions, including dying as a phase of advanced chronic illness that may extend for years, as well as dying at the end of old age. In order to provide adequate support services and timely palliative care, it is important to acknowledge and identify these varying and often ambiguous EOL trajectories. Following the Institute of Medicine, we define the EOL experience broadly to include periods of decline associated with advanced age or chronic illness where the timing of death is uncertain. To investigate the EOL process as it unfolds over time, we will use grounded theory methods to study eight diverse AL settings in Georgia that vary according to size (6-15 beds; 16-24 beds; 25-50 beds; and 51+ beds), resident and staff profile, rural/urban location, ownership, licensing status, and resources. The study will include low-income, rural, and racial/ethnic minority residents, groups typically excluded from AL research, as well as residents living in dementia units. Data collection in each home will extend over two years and include: 271 in-depth interviews, informal interviewing, review of focal residents' social and health records, and participant observation. The proposed study will identify modifiable factors associated with adverse EOL experiences and potential disparities in care that can be targets of intervention at multiple ecological levels and contribute to ongoing efforts to transform and improve the quality of EOL care for older adults in LTC and other care settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed five-year prospective qualitative study investigates end-of- life (EOL) care in Georgia assisted living (AL) facilities. Such research is crucial given the growing use of AL, the increasing frailty and diversity of the AL population, and the rising number of deaths reported in AL each year.

"Disparity in Incidence and Health Outcomes between Rural and Urban Patients with Alzheimers disease and related disorders ABSTRACT  By 2030, over 20% of the US population will be at least 65 years old, the age at which incidence of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) begins to increase. In 2014, 17% of the population living in rural areas was already over the age of 65, suggesting that rural populations may be disproportionally affected by ADRD in current and coming years. There is growing evidence that disparities in disease burden as well as availability, accessibility, affordability, and acceptability of health services exist among older adults living in rural areas, likely contributing to the growing gap in life expectancy witnessed between urban and rural communities. Previous studies have found that ADRD prevalence rates vary by gender, race, and ethnicity, yet few studies have examined disparities in diagnosis and outcomes of older adults living in urban and rural areas. Studies that have examined rural health disparities related to ADRD have largely focused on issues related to access to care, and suggest that ADRD patients in rural areas are more likely to receive suboptimal healthcare. There is a gap in our knowledge on how place of residence influences diagnosis and subsequent outcomes of older adults with ADRD. Understanding if disparities exist for older adults with ADRD living in rural areas could yield important insights into the risk factors for ADRD, the variables influencing the experience of living with ADRD, and the methods by which they can be more effectively managed. The objective of this application, the first step toward this long-term goal, is to conduct a population based study and thorough analysis to identify if rural-urban disparities in the diagnostic incidence and prevalence of ADRD, healthcare utilization, and health outcomes exist. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that rural Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD will be diagnosed later in the course of their disease and experience worse health outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work that shows the prevalence rate of ADRD is lower, yet the mortality rate due to ADRD is higher in states with a higher share of its population living in rural areas. To achieve this objective, we propose two aims. First, we will compare the diagnostic incidence and prevalence of ADRD between Medicare beneficiaries living in rural and urban communities. Second, we will compare survival and trajectories of acute, nursing home and home health care use in six years following the initial diagnosis of ADRD between rural and urban beneficiaries. We propose to study fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries in 2008-2015 integrating Medicare enrollment, claims, and resident assessment data. Findings of this study have several expected benefits for many. For policy makers, this research will enable evidence-based policy development aimed at improving rural health care. For rural health providers, this work will drive efforts to improve ADRD screening in order to ensure rural beneficiaries receive a timely diagnosis, which may delay future adverse outcomes. For rural health systems, these findings will help plan for future demand and understand gaps in our current system in meeting this population's needs. Narrative The goal of this proposed research is to examine the rural-urban disparity in the prevalence and incidence of an ADRD diagnosis and Medicare beneficiaries' subsequent health outcomes. Our results will help policy development and improve care practice to reduce rural-urban disparity.",Disparity in Incidence and Health Outcomes between Rural and Urban Patients with Alzheimers disease and related disorders,9225408,R03AG054687,"['Health Care Acceptability ', ' healthcare acceptability ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Population ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Home Health Nursing ', ' Visiting Nurse ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Family member ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Rural Community ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' 65+ years old ', ' care delivery ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Health system ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Improve Access ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Older Population ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' beneficiary ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' evidence base ', ' Medicare claim ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' screening ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' urban disparity ', ' rural setting ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2017,81250,0.05915064597171749

"A Mode of Data Collection for Non-English Speaking Older Adults from Collectivist Cultures ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective health promotion and disease prevention rely on high quality health data. Currently, there is limited health data on culturally and linguistically diverse populations, particularly foreign-born non-English speaking (NES) older adults from collectivist cultures. Data collection challenges have been attributed to culture and language barriers. Congruent with the National Institute of Nursing Research's strategic plan to conduct research using innovative technology to identify effective methodologies and strategies to promote health and prevent diseases of patients and families, this study aims to fill a knowledge gap-culturally appropriate data collection methods for NES older adults. Older Hmong adults will be the focus of this study as they embody the characteristics of collectivist, foreign-born older adult populations and are non-literate. The objectives of this proposed study are to 1) test the feasibility and acceptability of a novel mode of data collection, using a specifc technology, audio-computer assisted self-interviewing mode (ACASI); and 2) explore the impact of collectivist culture, family member helper, on item response by including a family helper. This novel mode of questionnaire is culturally and linguistically appropriate for a dyad 1) whose members may differ in familiarity with Hmong language, and comfort with technology, and 2) who lives in a collectivist culture. A 36 item questionnaire will be presented (using ACASI), in oral Hmong and written English simultaneously. This approach acknowledges common language differences between older and younger Hmong, as well as the common, strong bonds across the generations in collectivist cultures and is culturally and linguistically congruent with both generations. A sample of 30 Hmong participant dyads will be recruited from two community centers in a Midwestern city. Older Hmong adults will take the online questionnaire with the assistance of their younger family member. Immediately following completion of the online questionnaire, a follow-up face-to-face interview will be conducted with the dyads to explore the feasibility of the ACASI questionnaire and the influence of including a family member helper. I will audio record the dyads during the online questionnaire completion process and follow-up interview. The audio recordings will be transcribed verbatim and then analyzed, using thematic analysis. The interaction process between the younger and older family members while deciding how to respond to each question will be analyzed quantitatively using event sequencing analysis, to explore the influence of collectivist culture on questionnaire responses. Results of this study can be used to increase our understanding of how data can be collected with foreign born, NES older adults from collectivist cultures and how they respond to questions about their health. This could ultimately lead to the development of a more robust dataset on health behaviors and health risks and improved health promotion interventions. This study will lay a foundation for the applicant's program of research to eventually develop and test behavioral interventions to promote health and prevent disease among marginalized immigrant populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To advance health disparities research in health promotion and disease prevention, using new technology for data collection is needed to accommodate foreign-born, non-English speaking older adults from group-oriented collectivist cultures.

"Neighborhood Risk Factors for Falls in the Elderly Project Summary  Falls are the leading cause of unintentional fatal and non-fatal injuries in older adults. Prevention of fall injuries is a national public health priority (Healthy People 2020 Objective IVP-23.2 and OA-11). To date, most of the studies on elderly falls were conducted in urban neighborhoods. Little is known about the differences in circumstances and consequences of falls among older adults living in rural versus urban neighborhoods. To our knowledge, no study on falls has examined how older adults' space and time use differ in rural and urban neighborhoods, and how such differences are related to risk of falling. This project will investigate 1) the rural- urban differences in time and space use among older adults; and 2) how time and space use influences risks for indoor and outdoor falls among older adults living in different neighborhood environments.  We propose to establish a longitudinal cohort of 1,200 older adults age 65 years and older in Worcester County and surrounding towns, including 400 each from urban, suburban and rural neighborhood strata, and composed of at least 33% racial/ethnic minorities. Participants will be followed for three years. Fall events will be tracked using monthly falls calendar and follow-up telephone/online surveys. During the first year, once in late spring/summer/early fall and once in late fall/winter/early spring, participant mobility patterns with respect to space, frequency and duration will be measured using a global positioning system (GPS) unit, and participant timing, frequency, duration and intensity of indoor and outdoor activities will be concurrently measured using a accelerometer (ACC). Between months 18 and 30 the participants will wear the GPS and ACC devices a third time with 50% of the participants randomized to wear the devices during the late spring/summer/early fall seasons and 50% randomized to wear them in the late fall/winter/early spring seasons. During the follow-up years 2 and 3, participants will be followed using mail or online surveys twice a year querying their time and space use and health status. The GPS and ACC data will be integrated with participant reported health, perception and behavioral data as well as neighborhood environment data. The data will be analyzed to achieve the following goals:  Aim 1: To quantify the rural-urban differences in space and time use among older adults.  Aim 2: To identify predictors of space and time use, with a focus on modifiable factors.  Aim 3: To examine rural-urban disparities in fall risks in relation to patterns of space and time use.  Aim 4: To examine sex and racial disparities in fall risks in relation to space and time use.  Results from this research will inform the design of community-based programs for promoting active living and preventing falls that will be effective across the rural-urban continuum.

"Older Adults Living with Alzheimer's Disease and their Caregivers: Testing an Evidence-Based Intervention for Underserved Populations The Institute of Medicine identifies sexual/gender minority older adults as one of the most underserved populations, with significant health disparities. This at-risk group faces serious barriers to healthcare access, bias in health settings, and a lack of culturally competent care. The number of sexual/gender minority older adults living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/RD) and their caregivers (CGs) are growing rapidly, and will exceed 4 million by 2060. The lack of efficacious research-based interventions implemented to reduce disability and depression, and improve quality of life for these older adults living with AD/RD and their CGs,is a significant public health problem. Research has documented the protective role of CGs in the health of older adults living with AD/RD as well as CGs' hardships and challenges in caregiving and the impact of caregiving on health deterioration. Caregiving of such vulnerable older adults with AD/RD is particularly of concern due to this population's lower rate of cross-generational ties and their social stigma and isolation, which may be barriers to sustaining caregiving relationships. This project builds on the success of two major NIH projects, Aging with Pride: National Health, Aging, and Sexuality/Gender Study (2R01 AG026526; K. Fredriksen-Goldsen, PI) and Reducing Disabilities in Alzheimer's Disease (RDAD); R01 AG10845; L. Teri, PI) and will test the efficacy of an enhanced RDAD intervention for stigmatized populations addressing identity management, historical trauma and diverse peer support networks. The project will address the following aims: Aim 1. Test the translation and enhancement of RDAD designed to increase physical activities of these vulnerable older adult CRs with AD/RD and their CGs . Aim 2. Evaluate the short- and long-term effect of the enhanced and standard RDAD on primary (physical activity and functioning, perceived stress for CGs, institutionalization for CRs) and secondary outcomes (HRQOL, depressive symptomatology, behavioral disturbances for CRs). Aim 3. Test the moderating roles of CR-CG characteristics, e.g., type of CR-CG relationship, sex, severity of CR AD/RD, on the treatment effect of the standard and enhanced RDAD. This team of nationally recognized experts has more than 20 years of conducting Alzheimer's and minority aging research, with the expertise and established relationships necessary to test the first evidence-based intervention for demographically diverse vulnerable older adults living with AD/RD and their CGs. The findings from this study will be fully disseminated through caregiving and aging agencies, community-based organizations, and research networks across multiple sites and settings. Project Narrative Interventions to meet the health needs of sexual/gender minority older adults living with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (AD/RD) and their caregivers (CGs), as historically marginalized and underserved populations, are critically needed yet not developed. This study will test the translation and enhancement of the first community evidence-based dyadic caregiving intervention, Reducing Disabilities in Alzheimer's Disease, for these vulnerable older adults living with AD/RD to improve quality of life and reduce rates of institutionalization. The findings are critical in designing culturally tailored interventions and policy to respond to health disparities in Alzheimer's care in our increasingly diverse and growing older adult population.",Older Adults Living with Alzheimer's Disease and their Caregivers: Testing an Evidence-Based Intervention for Underserved Populations,9443934,R01AG055488,"['Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Faculty ', ' Health ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Oregon ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Sexuality ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Attenuated ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Physical Function ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Deterioration ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' treatment effect ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' traumatic event ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' peer support ', ' support network ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' informal care ', ' informal caregiving ', ' Informal care giving ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' Formal caregiving ', ' Formal care giving ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' symptomatology ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,742123,0.09672405494818417
"Educational Attainment, Geography, and U.S. Adult Mortality Risk PROJECT SUMMARY Educational attainment is one of the strongest social determinants of U.S. adult mortality risk. Studies to explain the education-mortality association have focused more on the individual-level “proximal” mechanisms (e.g., smoking) than identifying the contextual conditions that undergird the association. This major knowledge gap has consequences for science and public policy; it limits the discovery of explanations and interventions. The gap may reflect the dominant view in U.S. research that education is a personal resource. Accordingly, U.S. studies of the education-mortality association have emphasized agentic mechanisms: individuals with more education are thought to coalesce healthy lifestyles, seek out medical knowledge, avoid financial hardship, and so on. While agentic explanations are important, they ignore the fact that individuals are embedded in social and political contexts that influence the extent to which education matters for mortality. Despite numerous studies showing this to be the case in Europe, there has been scant research in the U.S. The goal of this study is to examine how and why the education-mortality association varies across U.S. states. Decisions made by governors and state legislatures affect employment, housing, transportation, social integration, healthy lifestyles, and numerous other social determinants of mortality. These state contexts have grown increasingly disparate through decades of deregulation and devolution. These trends may explain why, by the end of the 20th century, the range in life expectancy at age 50 across U.S. states exceeded the range across comparable high-income countries, and ½ of the variation in life expectancy across U.S. counties was attributable to the state within which they are located. This study addresses three questions: (1) How does the education-mortality association vary across states and over time?, (2) How does the variation in the education- mortality association across states and over time reflect state policies, resources, and opportunity structures?, and (3) What are the individual pathways through which state policies, resources, and opportunity structures shape the education-mortality association? The central hypothesis is that the association differs markedly across states, and that it is weakest in states with progressive economic policies, robust employment opportunities, and high social cohesion. The study will use data on adults aged 45-89 years in the restricted 1985-2011 National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality File. Using discrete-time survival models, it will examine all-cause and cause-specific mortality. All analyses will be stratified by gender, age group, and time period. Analyses account for interstate migration and county-level mortality variation to better isolate the importance of state contexts. Expected outcomes of this study include: (a) estimates of the education-mortality association by state, and (b) insights into policies and strategies that states might employ to reduce mortality among their populations. The long-term goal is to reduce adult mortality, especially among vulnerable groups. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will: (a) contribute to fundamental knowledge about how and why the magnitude of socioeconomic inequalities in adult mortality differ across U.S. states, and (b) identify policies and strategies that states might implement to reduce these inequalities and improve older adult longevity. The proposed research is relevant to several priorities of NIA, including its priority to reduce health disparities and eliminate health inequities among older adults.","Educational Attainment, Geography, and U.S. Adult Mortality Risk",9284575,R01AG055481,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decentralization ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Europe ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Housing ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Medicaid ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Politics ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Sales ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Taxation ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Transportation ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Mortality Determinants ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Economic Policy ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Outcome Study ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' social integration ', ' cohesion ', ' authority ', ' Cigarette ', ' Structure ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Science Policy ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' tobacco control ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' migration ', ' effective intervention ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' local economy ', ' discrete time ', ' education research ', ' ']",NIA,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,281486,0.06119802754802445
"The Burden of Care for Adults with Dementia: Impact on Care Quality and Family Outcomes Project Abstract: Care for older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) during the final years of life is extremely costly and families carry a high share of this burden. Costs and shifting patterns of year-over-year spending are likely associated with adverse care quality and family financial outcomes, yet to date individual- level, comprehensive, longitudinal data on spending and its effect on outcomes have not been examined. Existing data also demonstrate that those vulnerable subgroups least able to cope are at greatest financial risk, which may result in further disparities in outcomes. Therefore, this project aims to understand the magnitude of this healthcare spending and its distribution across payers and families over time and how this spending contributes to disparities in care quality and family outcomes among older adults with dementia, particularly among vulnerable and underserved populations. The study will assemble data that capture total healthcare spending and proportion by payer (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, individuals, families, and others), using the nationally-representative Health and Retirement Study and linked Medicare and Medicaid claims data. Specifically, the project will 1) Compare yearly patterns of total health-related costs and proportion of costs paid by Medicare, Medicaid, out-of-pocket, informal caregiving, and other payers, in each of the last 5 years of life among older adults with or without ADRD and across vulnerable subgroups; 2) Test if out-of-pocket costs exceeding household wealth are associated with indicators of care quality (nursing home admission for long- term care, ≥3 transitions across care sites in the last 90 days of life, suboptimal hospice use, i.e. enrollment >6 months or <3 days, and in-hospital death) among older adults with or without ADRD and across vulnerable subgroups; and 3) Examine if out-of-pocket costs exceeding household wealth are associated with potentially adverse intergenerational family financial outcomes (cohabitation, caregiving and financial support by adult children) among older adults with or without ADRD and across vulnerable subgroups. The results will directly inform health and social policy, and help to ensure high quality care for older adults with ADRD, while avoiding impoverishment of families and compounding of racial and socioeconomic disparities. Project Narrative: This project seeks to better understand the burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias on individuals, their families, and society and particularly those belonging to vulnerable social and demographic subgroups. We will examine individuals' health-related costs across all payers (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, individuals, families, and others), year-over-year, among older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, compared to those without dementia, and assess how spending influences both care quality and family outcomes. The results of this study will inform effective health and social policies that will ensure high quality care for elders with dementias and better distribute public and private healthcare resources.",The Burden of Care for Adults with Dementia: Impact on Care Quality and Family Outcomes,9213704,R01AG054540,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' cost shifting ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Family ', ' financial assistance ', ' Financial Support ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Hospices ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Persons ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Privatization ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Policies ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Unmarried ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' exhaust ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' exhaustion ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' intergenerational ', ' high school ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Adult Children ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' elder care ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' care burden ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' financial incentive ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' informal care ', ' informal caregiving ', ' Informal care giving ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' ']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,423750,0.030742853886729215
"The University of Florida Jacksonville Aging Studies Center (JAX-ASCENT) Summary Older adults of racial minorities and low socioeconomic (SES) status represent particularly high risk populations who are underserved and are significantly underrepresented in clinical research. This has led to a gap in knowledge regarding the appropriate and/or optimal prevention and treatment approaches for this high risk group. Within the state of Florida, the city of Jacksonville (JAX) has a high proportion of minority and low SES individuals. By expanding existing research collaborations on both aging and health disparities at its JAX site, the University of Florida (UF) has a unique opportunity to conduct important research that can reduce this knowledge gap. These existing relationships include partnership in conducting multi-center NIH-funded clinical trials, along with several community outreach efforts both at UF Gainesville (GNV) and JAX. However, there is currently no cohesive, organized resource to integrate these important research collaborations in aging and health disparities at UF-JAX. At the UF GNV campus, we have a strong clinical translational research infrastructure with the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center, Clinical Translational Science Institute and Disparities Research. In JAX, UF has a large health care facility in a densely populated minority and low SES area, but limited research infrastructure focused on aging research. To fully actualize the potential of this remarkable resource, we propose to develop a dedicated center for aging research focused on racial minorities and low SES older adults. This state-of-the-art clinical translational research facility for multidisciplinary research Jacksonville Aging Studies CENTer (JAX-ASCENT) will closely partner with the UF GNV campus and capitalize on our expertise and resources. Additionally, JAX-ASCENT will create an integrative physical and intellectual environment in which trainees at all levels and scientists from diverse disciplines can interact and conduct clinical and behavioral translational research on aging and independence of older adults. This focus will be pursued using an interdisciplinary approach that traverses a broad spectrum of biomedical investigation, including clinical research, behavioral sciences, social sciences, epidemiology, biostatistics, and health services, while implementing rigor and transparency in research. We will develop and partner regarding expertise on clinical trials, recruitment, adherence, retention, assessment of geriatric outcomes, biomarkers, and behavioral studies all focused and tailored on research in urban minorities and low SES older adults. We will apply a conceptual/logic model of community-based participatory research partnerships to improve community involvement and health outcomes, and to build a research participants registry. We will develop the physical and human infrastructure, mentor junior faculty towards leadership roles, and have JAX-ASCENT become self-sustaining. JAX-ASCENT will expand knowledge in clinical translational research in largely understudied populations and both enlarge and enrich the diversity of research in older minority populations, clinical effectiveness, outcomes, and community engagement programs at UF. Narrative With the development of JAX-ASCENT, we will provide resources and personnel (including NIH funded investigators) to support the development and implementation of behavioral, nutritional, and pharmacologic clinical trials, and observational studies of social determinants of health contributing to chronic diseases and functional decline in underserved, minority and low SES older adults. The JAX-ASCENT will fill a critical gap in knowledge regarding the translation and dissemination of research from efficacy studies to underserved, minority older adults who are at high risk of

"Communities Designed to Support Cardiovascular Health for Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Business establishments have the potential to shape individual behaviors including dietary intake, physical activity patterns, and management of chronic medical conditions, all with relevance to risk of myocardial infarction and related cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Policy strategies targeting local businesses may play an important role in CVD prevention, extending years of healthy life, and facilitating independent living. We propose to bring together commercially available ""big data"" and detailed population-based cohort data to examine the role of local business environments in CVD and racial disparities in CVD as they emerged across decades. Longitudinal studies of local environments have been strongly recommended as a direction for future research to advance our understanding of causal neighborhood effects on health. The local density of businesses with potential relevance to CVD has changed over time, and such temporal fluctuations vary across regions, cities and neighborhoods. These differences can be used to investigate how residentially stable older adults are affected by their local context. Meanwhile, older adults who relocate to a new home address may respond to their new context by changing health behaviors, offering another window into causation. However, careful attention is needed to acute health changes that precipitate relocation, and which local environment features predict aging in place despite new health or functional limitations. In the proposed project, we will link longitudinal data to investigate how neighborhood change and residential relocation shape cardiovascular health and health disparities. We will use a census of national businesses, the National Establishment Time Series (NETS). NETS data for all 52.4 million US business establishments includes annual point-level geocodes and business characteristics for the years 1990-2012, offering an unprecedented opportunity to characterize changing business environments nationally at multiple spatial scales. Geographic context data (from NETS as well as longitudinal population, safety, and transportation data) will be linked to individual data from two ongoing cohort studies: the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study. CHS is a well-characterized population- based study of 5,888 older adults (100% age 65+ at baseline, 58% female, 16% African American). A majority of the CHS participants enrolled 1990-1993 from four US sites, with         oversampling of African Americans, have been followed prospectively for the remainder of their lives, allowing in-depth characterization of neighborhood environments experienced by older adults in their final decades. REGARDS is also a prospective population-based cohort study with oversampling of African Americans, allowing for examination of racial disparities. However, the 30,239 REGARDS participants (49% age 65+ at baseline, 55% female, 42% African American) were enrolled more recently (2003-2007) and from a broader geographic region (48 contiguous US states, oversampling Stroke Belt residents). For these two cohorts with complementary strengths, cardiovascular events have been ascertained and longitudinal address data collected. This project brings together unparalleled data resources, builds on a track record of policy-relevant work with large geographic data resources, and leverages comprehensive cardiovascular cohort data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Businesses represent sources of food, walking destinations, and opportunities to access medical care. These aspects of the local environment have the potential to support healthy lifestyles, heart health, and independent living for an aging population. Following recommendations to study how neighborhood change affects health, this project brings together (1) unparalleled neighborhood data on all 52.4 million US businesses from 1990-2012, (2) detailed data on health of 36,127 adults over time from two cohort studies, and (3) an interdisciplinary research team with a track record of conducting and disseminating policy-relevant

"Older adults in vulnerable communities: Health and quality of life over time DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diversity, its growth and complexity, are defining features of the dramatic aging of the world-wide population. Research demonstrates that older adults from disadvantaged populations are at elevated risk of poor health, disability and premature death. The National Institutes of Health are committed to reducing and eliminating health disparities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that health disparities related to sexual orientation are one of the main gaps in health disparities research. Existing evidence demonstrates that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) older adults are an at-risk, under-investigated and under-served health disparate population. This study will examine the determinants of health impacting LGB older adults to assess change in health and quality of life (QOL) over time. Based on an innovative resilience conceptual framework, the pro- posed longitudinal research will obtain data from 2,000 LGB older adults who participated in the original study in order to allow us to understand the inter-relationships between risk and protective factors as well as cohort effects as they impact health and QOL of LGB older adults over time. This multidisciplinary collaboration of University of Washington researchers and community-based collaborators addresses a critical gap by identifying modifiable mechanisms impacting health and QOL over time. The primary goals of the project are as follows: 1) Investigate how lifetime victimization, everyday discrimination, stress (perceived stress and physiological response to stress) and health behavior change affects health and QOL of LGB older adults over time; 2) Evaluate how social relations (time-varying) and sexual identity management (time-varying) affect the associations among everyday discrimination, stress, health and QOL over time; and, 3) Test whether there is cohort heterogeneity in overall levels and age growth trajectories of health and QOL, and to what extent the differences in experiences within a historical context (e.g., time of sexual identity disclosure, lifetime victimization) between Baby Boom and Silent Generation LGB older adults account for these cohort effects. As the population ages, the health care costs associated with health disparities will continue to rise. To respond to this growing public health challenge it is imperative to identfy groups at high risk of disparities and to determine the modifiable mechanisms impacting their health and QOL as they age. The findings from this project will generate needed information to directly inform and guide the development of tailored interventions that can be effectively delivered within community-based agency settings to improve the health and QOL of demographically diverse older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the population ages, the health care costs associated with health disparities continue to rise. To reduce health disparities it is imperative to identify grous at risk of disparities and to determine the modifiable factors impacting their health and quality o life. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) older adults have been identified as an at-risk, under-investigated, and under-served health disparate population. This longitudinal research will identify risk and protective mechanisms impacting the health and quality of life of LGB older adults, which will directly contribute to the development of tailored interventions to improve the health of demographically diverse older adults.",Older adults in vulnerable communities: Health and quality of life over time,9271131,R01AG026526,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Baby Booms ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Generation Effect ', ' Cohort Effect ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Parents ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Complex ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' peer ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Social status ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Health behavior change ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex ', ' LGBTI ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,601504,0.18213166306425996
"Maximizing the Impact of ePHIM in Low-Income, Multiethnic Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to access, manage, and understand personal health information enables individuals to become  better consumers and participate more fully in making health care decisions.  The development of electronic health records and the availability of patient portals for accessing personal health records, coupled with myriad health information via the internet (eHealth), have provided the potential for electronic personal health information management (ePHIM).  However, great variability exists in access to eHealth information for components of the US population. Despite continuing efforts, this ""digital divide"" remains for rural, minority and low-income communities.  Limited access for ePHIM contributes to the health disparities experienced by these populations.  The goal of this project is to improve the ability of low-income African American, American Indian, Latino, and white older adults living in rural and urban communities to use information technology applications for ePHIM.  The project's conceptual framework combines the Technology Acceptance Model and the person- environmental interaction model.  It uses a community-based participatory partnership of Wake Forest School  of Medicine and its Outpatient Department Medicine Clinic, with Community Partners HealthNet, a network of  18 clinics serving 25 rural North Carolina counties, to achieve 3 specific aims:  (1) document the ePHIM  experience, knowledge, perceived needs, and perceived risks of low-income African American, American  Indian, Latino, and white older adults living in rural and urban communities~ (2) delineate the actual use of  ePHIM by low-income African American, American Indian, Latino, and white older adults living in rural and  urban communities~ and (3) delineate differences in perception, belief and experience in using ePHIM between  patients and caregivers who use versus those who do not use ePHIM.  This project is significant because it will delineate disparities in ePHIM by working with two networks of clinics (Community Partners HealthNet~ Outpatient Department Medicine Clinic/Wake Forest Baptist Health) that provides care to rural and urban, low- income, and minority patients.  Working with these networks, this project will implement in-depth and longitudinal research that will delineate the factors affecting ePHIM use among vulnerable elders.  This project is innovative.  (1)  It will use qualitative data collection techniques within a community-based participatory research framework to assess the motives and barriers to patients' and caregivers' ePHIM among rural as well as urban, low-income, older adult, and minority communities.  (2) It emphasizes the importance of including caregivers, particularly for older adults, in understanding the use of ePHIM.   (3) It will use these qualitative methods to assess the perceptions of health care providers and IT providers about the potential use of ePHIM.   (4) It will use these qualitative methods to determine the factors that facilitated and limited the use of ePHIM by comparing high / expert, medium, and low users.  (5) It will document the actual pattern of ePHIM use among older adults and their caregivers over a one-year period.  (6) It will explore the association of ePHIM use and chronic disease management among older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to access, manage and understand personal health information enables individuals to become better consumers and to participate more fully in making health care decisions.  Within a conceptual framework and using a community-based participatory partnership, this project will delineate the factors that facilitate or limit the useof electronic personal health information management (ePHIM).","Maximizing the Impact of ePHIM in Low-Income, Multiethnic Populations",9301464,R01HS021679,[''],AHRQ,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,461693,0.10514301017069506
"Evaluating disparities in older adult health, institutionalization, and mortality after implementation of Medicaid's Balancing Incentives Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Formal, or paid long term service and support (LTSS) have estimated annual costs of $211 to $306 billion in the U.S. and these expenditures are expected to rise as Baby Boomers age. Demographic trends including smaller family sizes, increased female workforce participation, and longer lifespans will reduce the availability of family caregivers, placing further burden on the formal LTSS system and especially on Medicaid, the nation's largest single payer of formal LTSS. Medicaid has been at the forefront of policy efforts to ""rebalance"" LTSS from institutional to home-and community-based settings. These rebalancing efforts reflect individuals' preferences to receive home- and community-based services (HCBS) and these transitions have also been shown to save about 15% in per capita LTSS spending over 10 years. In spite of this increased focus, evaluations of these rebalancing policies have largely neglected health and mortality outcomes, disparities in outcomes, and effects on older adults with specific health conditions such as dementia, who may have higher than average Medicaid expenditures. The most recently implemented rebalancing policy is the Balancing Incentive Program (BIP), which offers additional funding to states to increase access to LTSS in states that were spending less than 50% of LTSS expenditures on HCBS. We will conduct the first formal evaluation of BIP's effects on four health outcomes: self-rated health, functioning, long-term institutionalization, and mortality. There is reason to suspect that disparities in these outcomes may also be affected after BIP's implementation, as whites and minorities tend to employ very different LTSS strategies and have different levels of access to care. Similarly, individuals living in rural areas are more likey than their urban counterparts to have few or distant medical providers and fragmented care coordination, all of which limit their ability to obtain necessary care and adversely affect individual and population health outcomes. This proposal employs a mixed-method approach to (1) conduct qualitative analyses to identify states' BIP implementation stages and challenges; (2) test the effect of BIP implementation on the four health outcomes using a difference-in- difference approach that capitalizes on the quasi-experimental framework to compare states that did and did not (but were eligible to) implement BIP; (3) assess racial/ethnic and rural/urban differences in BIP's effects on health; and (4) examine whether health conditions and access to informal care (unpaid care generally provided by family), and county- or state-level access to formal care further modify the effects of BIP on health outcomes and disparities. Multiple administrative and survey databases spanning 2008-2017 will be merged to examine health outcomes for dual-eligible adults 65 years and older who live in BIP and non-BIP states. The goal of this study is to provide policymakers with rigorous analyses of BIP's effects on health and health disparities. While these analyses focus on BIP, the results have implications for HCBS more generally and for understanding how rebalancing policies influence health and health disparities in older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal evaluates the U.S.'s most recent long-term services and supports (LTSS) rebalancing policy, the Balancing Incentive Program (BIP), which bolsters participating states' ability to increase access to care in home- and community-based settings. We will examine how BIP implementation influences older adults' self- reported health, functioning measured by activities of daily living, risk of long-term institutionalization, and ris of mortality. Further, we test whether BIP implementation reduces or exacerbates existing racial/ethnic and rural/urban disparities in these outcomes. We also examine whether these effects vary by an individual's health conditions, access to informal (unpaid) care from family members, and access to formal (paid) care at the county and state levels.","Evaluating disparities in older adult health, institutionalization, and mortality after implementation of Medicaid's Balancing Incentives Program",9403940,R01MD010360,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communities ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Family Sizes ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Home Care Services ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Policies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Urban Health ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' patient home care ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' single payer ', ' Single-Payer System ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Distant ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Gray unit of radiation dose ', ' Gray ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' success ', ' Stretching ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' dual eligible ', ' community based service ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' waiver ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' informal care ', ' urban residence ', ' urban disparity ', ' rural households ', ' rural residence ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' incentive-based program ', ' incentive program ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' baby boomer ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2018,845551,0.06624980533366984
"Peer Empowerment Program for Physical Activity in Low Income & Minority Seniors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peer Empowerment Program for Physical Activity in Low Income & Minority Seniors Older adults are the least active population group in the US. Yet, research has shown that an increase in physical activity (PA) can have immediate and profound effects on cardiovascular health. Older adults who are active use significantly fewer health care resources, and with the increasing number of older adults in the US it is imperative to curb health care expenditure in this group. Many PA interventions are flawed because they focus on individual motivations and ignore variations in community resources, neighborhood walkability, and safety. Low income and ethnically diverse communities have disproportionately fewer resources and less supportive neighborhoods. This contributes to lower PA levels and health disparities in obesity, diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. National and international health institutions have called for community based PA programs to improve population health. Senior centers are an ideal setting for PA interventions because they serve a large number of older adults and there are funding mechanisms for delivery of evidence based programs. While there are multiple benefits of different PA programs, national guidelines for PA still emphasize aerobic activity. Senior Centers currently offer group based PA programs but our preliminary studies show that 1) low income, ethnically diverse older adults attending such centers are not meeting PA guidelines, 2) evidence based programs in such centers do not generate moderate intensity PA, 3) they do not provide behavioral strategies to support more frequent and independent PA and 4) members are not involved in the delivery of such programs which may increase engagement and sustainability. We propose to build upon our NHLBI R01 funded PA program that increased aerobic activity in retirement community residents. The program was delivered by UCSD health educators for 6 months with the help of peer leaders who then sustained it over 12 months. To improve upon this work, we propose a train the trainer model with a greater focus on empowering the peer leaders, center staff and participants to self-monitor, self-organize and advocate for additional resources from the start. Since our aim is to test a PA program that can be adopted by local area aging agencies with Older Americans Act Title IIID funds, we will employ an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design; which allows for the concurrent testing of both intervention and implementation strategies and outcomes. We will also extend program monitoring to 24 months. Thus, in a 2-year cluster randomized controlled field trial of 408 ethnically diverse, older adults (50+ years old) in 12 low income Senior Centers in San Diego County we will investigate the efficacy of PEP4PA (Peer Empowerment Program 4 Physical Activity) to reduce disparities in PA by increasing the percentage of participants achieving 150 minutes of PA per week and to improve physical functioning & fitness, blood pressure, depressive symptoms and quality of life at 6, 12 & 24 months. We will assess the incremental cost effectiveness ratio of PEP4PA in terms of cost per MET hour and cost per QALY compared to usual programming in the control centers at 12 & 24 months. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older adults are the least active population group in the US. Disparities by income exist for key diseases related to physical activity (PA).

"Racial disparities in diabetes- and prediabetes-associated outcomes in older adults PROJECT SUMMARY Diabetes disproportionately affects older adults. Recent estimates from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) found over 25% of U.S. adults over the age of 65 are living with diabetes, with the prevalence in African Americans almost double that in Caucasians. As the general population continues to age, the societal health burden associated with dysglycemia, and the associated racial disparities, will only continue to increase. Little is understood about the impacts of aging on the progression and associated complications of dysglycemia and prior findings in middle-age adults may not generalize to the aging population. With the dearth of focused work on this age group, most guidelines on the diabetes care of older adults remain based on expert opinion. Better characterization of the racial disparities and interaction of aging with dysglycemia in this population is needed to inform responsible evidence-based clinical care. Our proposed aims focus on addressing the following knowledge gaps using the longitudinal data available from non-Hispanic black and white adults in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. 1. What are the racial disparities in the short-term clinical and subclinical outcomes of pre-diabetes and  diabetes in older adults? 2. How does diabetes awareness, care practice, and treatment satisfaction differ by race in older adults? 3. What is the association of treatment understanding and satisfaction with burden of chronic diabetes-related  complications? Do differences in these measures mediate the racial disparities in outcomes? We hypothesize that aging is a potential modifier of the physiologic impacts of hyperglycemia as well as the racial disparities in associated outcomes, contributing to differential risk profiles in this age group. With the complexities of aging, older adults present unique clinical challenges that require individualization of treatment. However, lack of standardized approaches may further exacerbate racial disparities. Disparities in disease awareness, care patterns, and treatment satisfaction could have implications for the severity of both clinical and subclinical complications. Our proposed work will supply insight into these open questions and provide the fellowship applicant with a rigorous mentored training in epidemiologic and biostatistical skills needed for her future career goals of becoming an academic physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to characterize racial disparities in the clinical implications of dysglycemia, diabetes understanding, care practices, and treatment satisfaction in older adults. Findings from these analyses will contribute to the critical need for evidence to guide clinical diabetes care of patients in this age group.

"Asian Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) Abstract: Overall RCMAR  We propose the Chicago Asian RCMAR to advance careers of investigators from underrepresented populations through translational trauma and resilience research amongst one of the most understudied, yet fastest growing populations in the U.S.: Asian American older adults. Such an important focus in research, population and investigators will inform both practice and policy at community, regional and national levels. Asians are the fastest growing yet most understudied US minority group at 21 million people and growing 56% from 2000-2013. Yet, < 1% of NIH research funding in the last 10 years were focused on US Asian populations, with only 3-5 total funded NIH grants/yr that focus on US Asian older adults. Moreover, this population experiences the “Asian Paradox”: while on average, US Asians, are the highest-income earners and the most highly-educated, more Asians, especially older adults, live below the poverty line, are less likely to participate in biomedical research, and suffer disproportional health disparities compared to white Americans. These health inequities are further complicated by the heterogeneity of these immigrant populations, especially with respect to culture, religion, language, sexual identity, and trauma exposure, many of which challenge our assumptions about the “model minority” stereotype. Such exposures and heterogeneities lead to isolation and further removal from opportunities to participate in research, thus restricting benefits conferred from population level research. However, despite this diversity, there are unifying themes across Asian cultures with regard to shared experiences of immigration, trauma, strong family bonds, cultural values and expectations, and the intergenerational nature of the aging process.  Building on two decades of rigorous aging research in minority populations and track records of successful academic achievements, we have leveraged strong existing transdisciplinary partnerships across multiple academic and community institutions to build a center designed to foster the next generation of diverse researchers in a nurturing environment that is conducive to success and promotes highly relevant and rigorous trauma, resilience and health outcomes research among Asian American older adults. We propose the following scientific lines of inquiry: 1) Understand the cross-ethnic variations in the social, cultural, and behavioral mechanisms of trauma and stress across Asian populations; 2) Explore the potential differential health outcomes associated with trauma, immigration, and mechanisms of resilience in ameliorating adverse consequences among Asian populations; and 3) Build institutional and community capacity that tests and adapts and implements evidence based behavioral change strategies to prevent and treat trauma, promote resilience, and mitigate the effect of stressful events in Asian aging populations.

"University of Florida Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the University of Florida Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) is twofold: 1) to optimize older persons' physical performance and mobility through interdisciplinary approaches; and 2) to train new investigators in aging and disability research while developing their leadership qualities. Our goal is to enhance late-life health and independence, with a special focus on mobility. To accomplish our mission, our strategy is to attract studies and inventive investigators from diverse behavioral, clinical, basic, and technological science disciplines with a common research focus: “mobility and prevention of disability.” Traversing the entire spectrum of biomedical investigation, including molecular biology, animal studies, clinical research, behavioral sciences, epidemiology, and engineering, our research effort addresses the OAIC's general goal: to increase scientific knowledge that leads to better ways to maintain or restore independence of older people. Our research objectives are to: 1) assess, using translational research (among diverse disciplines), the biological, co-morbid, psychosocial, behavioral, and other factors that contribute to physical function decline, loss of mobility, and progression toward disability; and 2) develop and reliably test, in clinical and preclinical studies, interventions that target mobility to prevent, delay, or recover the age-related declines in physical function. Our educational objective is to train future leaders in clinical translational research on aging. To meet these objectives the proposed OAIC trains Junior Scholars and supports investigators, resources, services, external studies, development projects, and pilot/exploratory studies through seven integrated cores:  • Leadership and Administrative Core;  • Research Education Core;  • Pilot/Exploratory Studies Core;  • Clinical Research Core;  • Metabolism and Translational Science Core;  • Biostatistics Core; and  • Data Science and Applied Technology Core.  A relevant strength of the proposed OAIC is the concerted action of the interdisciplinary cores, projects, and investigators who address one common research focus spanning the entire spectrum of biomedical investigation. Narrative Better knowledge of the factors leading to optimizing mobility and developing efficacious and effective interventions to avert disability will have a major impact on practicing evidence-based geriatric medicine and public health.",University of Florida Claude D.

"Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes Project Summary/Abstract The Hispanic population in the U.S. aged 65 and older has been growing rapidly and is projected to increase 5- fold between 2012 and 2050, when Hispanics are expected to make up more than 18% of the older adult population. Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. Disease diagnosis is often the basis for estimating prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in the population. People of Hispanic origin, however, are at greater risk of under diagnosis because of the unique challenges they face accessing and interacting with the health care system. The main objectives of the proposed project are two-fold: 1) to obtain estimates of hypertension and diabetes prevalence for different Hispanic subpopulations, defined by ethnic origin, nativity, and time in the U.S.; and 2) to determine how sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment interact to influence risk for hypertension and diabetes. Data for this project come from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which includes a large diverse sample of Hispanics, information on both disease diagnosis and direct assessments of disease risk, and contextual data on the social, economic, and health care environment. Multilevel modeling and logistic regression models will be used to: 1) examine the association between sociocultural factors and reported and measured disease prevalence; 2) determine if variation in health insurance and health care utilization accounts for Hispanic group differences in hypertension and diabetes; and 3) determine if variation in the sociomedical environment account for Hispanic differences in hypertension and diabetes. Results from the proposed project will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities. Project Narrative Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population.

"Multimorbidity Patterns in Middle-Aged and Older Couples: Implications for Psychological Well-Being and Health Behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY  Multimorbidity is an increasingly prevalent public health concern among middle-aged and older adults. Multiple chronic conditions place a high burden on individuals and their families, leading to elevated rates of hospitalization, disability, and mortality. The spousal tie is a crucial source of health-related influence and support for aging adults with chronic illness. Yet little is known about how individuals with multimorbidity may affect and/or be affected by their spouse in ways that benefit or harm their long-term health. Moreover, few studies have considered multimorbidity in both spouses. Multiple chronic conditions may be particularly stressful when they involve management strategies that are discordant (e.g., reducing cardiovascular risk factors vs. reducing pain) within or between spouses due to heightened support needs. Discordant conditions may also strain limited personal resources and disrupt each partner's self-care routines, resulting in decreased health-promoting behaviors (e.g., physical activity) and increased health-risk behaviors (e.g., alcohol use) that ultimately diminish their health and well-being. This project will advance the literature by examining patterns of multimorbidity within mid- and late-life couples, their long-term implications for psychological well-being and health behaviors, and sociodemographic and psychosocial factors that may buffer or exacerbate these links.  The proposed project will draw on data from ten waves (1996 to 2014) of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), including both members of the spousal dyad. We will explore three specific areas of inquiry: First, we will determine patterns of multimorbidity within and between spouses, focusing on concordance in their management activities and whether patterns vary by sociodemographics. Second, we will evaluate long-term associations between couples' multimorbidity patterns and both spouses' psychological well-being (depressive symptoms) and health behaviors (sleep, physical activity, alcohol use, and smoking). Third, we will identify sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, race, and education) and psychosocial resources (control beliefs, relationship quality with one's spouse, family members, and friends) that moderate these associations.  This project will generate critical information about combinations of multiple chronic conditions that may have lasting effects on health and well-being in aging couples. Research has established that there are consistent associations between one spouse's illness and his or her partner's physical and psychological health; but prior work has placed a near exclusive emphasis on a single chronic condition in one spouse, neglecting an understanding of each partner's multiple conditions and their potential consequences for well- being and health within the marriage. Findings will inform targeted interventions to promote the long-term well- being of older individuals and families managing multiple chronic conditions as well as a more comprehensive approach to the treatment of multimorbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Multiple chronic conditions often involve discordant management activities that may be stressful for individuals and their spouses due to increased support needs, strained personal resources, and disrupted self- care routines in the marriage. Drawing on a nationally representative sample of middle-aged and older couples, this project will 1) identify patterns of multimorbidity both within and between spouses, focusing on concordance in the management activities required by multiple conditions and whether patterns vary by age, gender, race, and education; 2) investigate the long-term implications of these patterns for each partner's psychological well-being and health behaviors; and 3) evaluate sociodemographic characteristics and psychosocial resources that may buffer or exacerbate such associations. Considering multimorbidity in a dyadic context will inform targeted interventions to maintain the health and functioning of an especially vulnerable population of aging adults.",Multimorbidity Patterns in Middle-Aged and Older Couples: Implications for Psychological Well-Being and Health Behaviors,9432760,R03AG057838,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Arthritis ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Buffers ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Couples ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Marriage ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' mortality ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Persons ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Sleep ', ' Smoking ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Family member ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Attenuated ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' member ', ' holistic approach ', ' Categories ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Consequentialism ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' neglect ', ' family management ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' aged ', ' older women ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' routine care ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' health data ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain reduction ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2018,78000,0.00872693466563725
"Understanding the Causes, Consequences, and Severity of Elder Mistreatment: A Longitudinal, Population-Based Study Project Summary/Abstract The current state of basic elder mistreatment (EM) science on risk factors and consequences to inform the development of effective primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention interventions is constrained by a literature with substantial methodological limitations. In particular, the field lacks longitudinal population-based research inclusive of vulnerable older adult sub-populations that provides generalizable and causally-inferred information. Further, population-based research to date has limited EM measurement to binary (no/yes) outcomes that obscure the variation in severity characterizing this issue. The goal of the proposed project is to overcome long-standing methodological limitations in the EM literature to advance more generalizable basic science on EM risk factors and consequences and to integrate severity into understanding of the problem. This study will collect a second wave of data (nine years post) from the population-based New York State Elder Mistreatment Prevalence Study (NYSEMPS). Drawing on a representative, probability Wave 1 sample, direct telephone interviews will be conducted with a follow-up sample (n = approx.1555) of older adults or close proxies, regardless of cognitive status or living setting to address the following aims: 1) identify longitudinal EM risk factors for older adults in the general population, 2) describe how EM severity changes over time among victims and identify factors predicting changes in severity, 3) identify longitudinal EM health consequences, and 4) understand the relationship between EM severity and adverse health consequences. The proposed study adheres to accepted conceptual boundaries that define EM as a distinct form of victimization and is informed by a longitudinal stress process conceptual framework. The methodological advancements underlying the proposed study have the capacity to generate the most valid, reliable, and generalizable information on EM risk factors, consequences, and severity to date. Findings from this study will directly inform targeted primary, secondary, and tertiary EM prevention interventions. Project Narrative Elder mistreatment is a pervasive problem affecting a growing older adult population that carries serious consequences, including mortality and physical/mental health morbidities. The proposed research will generate generalizable knowledge on elder mistreatment risk factors, consequences, and severity to inform targeted public health, social service, and medical interventions designed to prevent, respond to, and treat victimization.","Understanding the Causes, Consequences, and Severity of Elder Mistreatment: A Longitudinal, Population-Based Study",9589587,R01AG060080,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Communities ', ' Concept Formation ', ' conceptual processes ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Elder Abuse ', ' senior abuse ', ' elderly abuse ', ' elder mistreatment ', ' elder maltreatment ', ' abuse of older adults ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Female ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' New York ', ' Population Growth ', ' Prevalence Study ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Probability ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Sociology ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Rural ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Physical Dependence ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Proxy ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' tertiary prevention ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' perpetrators ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' child maltreatment ', ' Childhood maltreatment ', ' Child Abuse and Neglect ', ' Clinical Nursing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' modifiable risk ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2018,185061,0.06728876729315356
"Epidemiology of racial differences in decision making among older adults ABSTRACT Sound decision making is important for maintaining independence and well-being across the lifespan but is critical in old age, when some of life’s most complex and impactful decisions are made. Recent work from our group and others has shown that decision making requires cognitive, contextual and psychosocial resources and that many older persons—even those without cognitive impairment—are vulnerable to poor decision making in key domains such as finance and health and frequently become victims of fraud. Poor decision making in aging predicts several adverse health outcomes including Alzheimer’s disease, incident mild cognitive impairment and mortality and poses a major public health and economic challenge. Importantly, however, most of the research on decision making to date has involved White participants. Relatively little is known about decision making among African Americans, despite well documented racial differences in the cognitive, contextual (e.g., socioeconomic status) and psychosocial (e.g., psychological distress) resources that influence decision making. Building on our conceptual model of decision making in aging and compelling preliminary data that suggest racial differences, we hypothesize that racial differences in decision making contribute to disparities in health outcomes and that contextual and psychosocial factors account for these differences. The goal of the proposed study, submitted in response to PAR-16-448, is to elucidate the determinants and adverse health consequences of racial differences in decision making. This study will leverage the unique resources of an ongoing study of African Americans, the Minority Aging Research Study, to collect new longitudinal data on multiple aspects of decision making (i.e., financial and health decision making, temporal discounting, scam susceptibility, fraud victimization) and related contextual and psychosocial factors in 600 older African Americans without dementia. These newly collected data will be linked with identical longitudinal decision making data already available from an ongoing study of more than 1,100 Whites from the Memory and Aging Project to support analyses of: 1) racial differences in decision making among African Americans and Whites matched on demographics and cognition, 2) the contextual and psychosocial factors that drive them, and 3) the degree to which racial differences in decision making contribute to disparities in health. Thus, this study is uniquely poised to efficiently identify the determinants and public health impact of racial differences in decision making and will facilitate new therapeutic approaches to promote independence, health and well-being among diverse older persons. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this study is to identify the determinants and adverse health consequences of racial differences in decision making among older adults. This study will yield new knowledge that is critically important for identifying modifiable targets for interventions to reduce racial differences in decision making and associated health disparities including the risk of Alzheimer’s disease among diverse older adults.",Epidemiology of racial differences in decision making among older adults,9588733,R01AG060376,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Cognition ', ' Decision Making ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fraud ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Memory ', ' mortality ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Trust ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' discount ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' health literacy ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' discounting ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' demographics ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive ability ', ' rate of change ', ' financial literacy ', ' ']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,573017,0.023100207124117325
"Effect of Hospital and Community Care Coordination on Health Care Access, Quality and Equity among Individuals with Risk Factors or Diagnosis of ADRD SUMMARY Disparity populations, in particular aging African-Americans and Hispanics (65 years and older), are significantly more likely to have Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) than older Whites in the same age range. Delays in accessing timely primary care, lack of care coordination, and variations in lifestyle and socioeconomic conditions are considered as major factors that contribute to racial and ethnic disparities. Health care coordination, such as chronic care management and post-hospital discharge continuity of care programs, has been identified as a critical component in improving quality of care and patient experience. In addition, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) have been proposed to promote care coordination through team-based approaches and financial incentives. However, little is known about how these system-level care coordination strategies have improved health care access, quality and equity for populations with ADRD. The objective of our project is to determine best hospital-community care coordination practices that can improve effective management of ADRD and co-existing conditions; control/reduce modifiable risk factors of ADRD and administer health care for these diseases in early stages; and eventually promote population health and reduce health disparities. Our primary hypothesis is that integrating hospital and community care can improve quality and equity among people with ADRD as well as cognitively healthy older adults at increased risk for ADRD. We will leverage our comprehensive, national data on care coordination, and construct a multi-level data set (individual-, hospital/ACO-, community-, and state- level) by linking Medicare claims data and Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organizations data to address our primary hypothesis. Using a population-level longitudinal study (2012-2018), we aim to identify the influences of care coordination practices and ACOs on health care access, quality, and cost for people with ADRD and older adults at increased risk for ADRD (including adults living with diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, smoking, and mild cognitive impairment) (Aims 1 and 2); estimate the impact of care coordination on one of the hardest-to-reach populations: racial and ethnic minority populations who received federal housing assistance (who may have experienced periods of homelessness) (Aim 3); and highlight care coordination practices and the ACO models that can reduce racial and ethnic disparities (Aim 4). Our multidisciplinary, systems-based approach will enable us to identify the most critical care coordination practices that will have the greatest impact on increasing effective care for minority patients with ADRD; and control diseases in early stages among those with ADRD risk factors. Our results will provide policy makers with critical information on how to utilize existing resources to integrate care coordination across the health care system to ensure that minorities get access to the most appropriate and effective care. The goal aligns with the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease that aims to enhance care quality and efficiency. NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because results will identify care coordination practices and ACO structures that can promote health care access and quality for people with risk factors or diagnosis of ADRD, with a focus on African Americans, Latinos, and the hardest-to-reach Housing and Urban Development (HUD) population. Results of our study are expected to provide evidence on cost-effective care coordination practices that can make care integration sustainable for underserved populations. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIA’s mission (PAR-18-596): “to consider how institutional and social contexts influence disparities in service access and quality; and identify how regulatory and economic incentives affect access, quality, and health outcomes in health systems for people with dementia.”","Effect of Hospital and Community Care Coordination on Health Care Access,

"Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research Overall Abstract The Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR), a mature social and behavioral science center of the Resource Center for Minority Aging Research program, proposes to expand its reach and impact by mentoring junior faculty (most of whom will be African American) and by focusing on African American Life-course health research. Michigan State University (MSU) will formally join the University of Michigan (UM) and Wayne State University (WSU) to form the new MCUAAAR. Our three specific aims include: 1) Increase reach and coverage by including Michigan State University as a full partner in the MCUAAAR; 2) Recruit and mentor 15 new junior researchers; and, 3) Increase important research on the life-course experiences of older adults of diverse ethnic and racial populations, especially African Americans. Four cores are proposed in this application; Administrative, Analytic, REC and CLRC. We will employ an integrative approach to mentoring, entailing a structured set of activities and training across the pilot funding period: (a) Formal goals will be set at the beginning of the pilot and reviewed in monthly MCUAAAR meetings; (b) Based on the goals set, a mentoring team will be assembled to assist with research, dissemination of findings, and research translation; (c) A set of training activities in scientific writing, measurement, and community-based research partnerships will be conducted each year; (d) A formal six-month evaluation will be conducted and shared with the MCUAAAR faculty; and, (e) During the second year, an ongoing MCUAAAR mentor will be assigned to assist with publications and grant preparation and provide support to junior researchers attending conferences. There will also be opportunities for longer-term mentoring and training in the program. We continue to be motivated by an NIH-funded series of studies (e.g., Ginther et al., 2011) in which applications from black scientists were shown to be 10 percentage points less likely to obtain grant awards than applications from white investigators; in practical terms, this gap means that white applicants are about twice as likely as blacks to be approved and funded. The RCMAR program has been important in helping to eliminate this gap for RCMAR researchers overall, and we continue to focus on the importance of abolishing the disparity for African American researchers in particular. We are also motivated by the continuing disparities in chronic disease and mortality among older African Americans. Project Narrative The purpose of the MCUAAAR is to recruit, mentor, and develop the next generation of diverse NIH researchers engaged in research on the science and amelioration of health inequities and disparities among African American older adult populations.",Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research,9532367,P30AG015281,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Capsicum ', ' pepper ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Evolution ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Universities ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' meetings ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' research data dissemination ', ' research dissemination ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' faculty research ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' urban setting ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2018,751126,0.0005178077448345926
"Educational Attainment, Geography, and U.S. Adult Mortality Risk PROJECT SUMMARY Educational attainment is one of the strongest social determinants of U.S. adult mortality risk. Studies to explain the education-mortality association have focused more on the individual-level “proximal” mechanisms (e.g., smoking) than identifying the contextual conditions that undergird the association. This major knowledge gap has consequences for science and public policy; it limits the discovery of explanations and interventions. The gap may reflect the dominant view in U.S. research that education is a personal resource. Accordingly, U.S. studies of the education-mortality association have emphasized agentic mechanisms: individuals with more education are thought to coalesce healthy lifestyles, seek out medical knowledge, avoid financial hardship, and so on. While agentic explanations are important, they ignore the fact that individuals are embedded in social and political contexts that influence the extent to which education matters for mortality. Despite numerous studies showing this to be the case in Europe, there has been scant research in the U.S. The goal of this study is to examine how and why the education-mortality association varies across U.S. states. Decisions made by governors and state legislatures affect employment, housing, transportation, social integration, healthy lifestyles, and numerous other social determinants of mortality. These state contexts have grown increasingly disparate through decades of deregulation and devolution. These trends may explain why, by the end of the 20th century, the range in life expectancy at age 50 across U.S. states exceeded the range across comparable high-income countries, and ½ of the variation in life expectancy across U.S. counties was attributable to the state within which they are located. This study addresses three questions: (1) How does the education-mortality association vary across states and over time?, (2) How does the variation in the education- mortality association across states and over time reflect state policies, resources, and opportunity structures?, and (3) What are the individual pathways through which state policies, resources, and opportunity structures shape the education-mortality association? The central hypothesis is that the association differs markedly across states, and that it is weakest in states with progressive economic policies, robust employment opportunities, and high social cohesion. The study will use data on adults aged 45-89 years in the restricted 1985-2011 National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality File. Using discrete-time survival models, it will examine all-cause and cause-specific mortality. All analyses will be stratified by gender, age group, and time period. Analyses account for interstate migration and county-level mortality variation to better isolate the importance of state contexts. Expected outcomes of this study include: (a) estimates of the education-mortality association by state, and (b) insights into policies and strategies that states might employ to reduce mortality among their populations. The long-term goal is to reduce adult mortality, especially among vulnerable groups. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will: (a) contribute to fundamental knowledge about how and why the magnitude of socioeconomic inequalities in adult mortality differ across U.S. states, and (b) identify policies and strategies that states might implement to reduce these inequalities and improve older adult longevity. The proposed research is relevant to several priorities of NIA, including its priority to reduce health disparities and eliminate health inequities among older adults.","Educational Attainment, Geography, and U.S. Adult Mortality Risk",9559619,R01AG055481,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decentralization ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Europe ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Housing ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Medicaid ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Politics ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Sales ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Taxation ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Transportation ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Mortality Determinants ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Economic Policy ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Outcome Study ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' social integration ', ' cohesion ', ' authority ', ' Cigarette ', ' Structure ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Science Policy ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' tobacco control ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' migration ', ' effective intervention ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' local economy ', ' discrete time ', ' education research ', ' ']",NIA,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,272326,0.06119802754802445
"Older Adults Living with Alzheimer's Disease and their Caregivers: Testing an Evidence-Based Intervention for Underserved Populations The Institute of Medicine identifies sexual/gender minority older adults as one of the most underserved populations, with significant health disparities. This at-risk group faces serious barriers to healthcare access, bias in health settings, and a lack of culturally competent care. The number of sexual/gender minority older adults living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/RD) and their caregivers (CGs) are growing rapidly, and will exceed 4 million by 2060. The lack of efficacious research-based interventions implemented to reduce disability and depression, and improve quality of life for these older adults living with AD/RD and their CGs,is a significant public health problem. Research has documented the protective role of CGs in the health of older adults living with AD/RD as well as CGs' hardships and challenges in caregiving and the impact of caregiving on health deterioration. Caregiving of such vulnerable older adults with AD/RD is particularly of concern due to this population's lower rate of cross-generational ties and their social stigma and isolation, which may be barriers to sustaining caregiving relationships. This project builds on the success of two major NIH projects, Aging with Pride: National Health, Aging, and Sexuality/Gender Study (2R01 AG026526; K. Fredriksen-Goldsen, PI) and Reducing Disabilities in Alzheimer's Disease (RDAD); R01 AG10845; L. Teri, PI) and will test the efficacy of an enhanced RDAD intervention for stigmatized populations addressing identity management, historical trauma and diverse peer support networks. The project will address the following aims: Aim 1. Test the translation and enhancement of RDAD designed to increase physical activities of these vulnerable older adult CRs with AD/RD and their CGs . Aim 2. Evaluate the short- and long-term effect of the enhanced and standard RDAD on primary (physical activity and functioning, perceived stress for CGs, institutionalization for CRs) and secondary outcomes (HRQOL, depressive symptomatology, behavioral disturbances for CRs). Aim 3. Test the moderating roles of CR-CG characteristics, e.g., type of CR-CG relationship, sex, severity of CR AD/RD, on the treatment effect of the standard and enhanced RDAD. This team of nationally recognized experts has more than 20 years of conducting Alzheimer's and minority aging research, with the expertise and established relationships necessary to test the first evidence-based intervention for demographically diverse vulnerable older adults living with AD/RD and their CGs. The findings from this study will be fully disseminated through caregiving and aging agencies, community-based organizations, and research networks across multiple sites and settings. Project Narrative Interventions to meet the health needs of sexual/gender minority older adults living with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (AD/RD) and their caregivers (CGs), as historically marginalized and underserved populations, are critically needed yet not developed. This study will test the translation and enhancement of the first community evidence-based dyadic caregiving intervention, Reducing Disabilities in Alzheimer's Disease, for these vulnerable older adults living with AD/RD to improve quality of life and reduce rates of institutionalization. The findings are critical in designing culturally tailored interventions and policy to respond to health disparities in Alzheimer's care in our increasingly diverse and growing older adult population.",Older Adults Living with Alzheimer's Disease and their Caregivers: Testing an Evidence-Based Intervention for Underserved Populations,9565372,R01AG055488,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Faculty ', ' Health ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Oregon ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Sexuality ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Attenuated ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Physical Function ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Deterioration ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' treatment effect ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' traumatic event ', ' marginalization ', ' social exclusion ', ' peer support ', ' support network ', ' care receiver ', ' care recipients ', ' informal care ', ' Informal care giving ', ' informal caregiving ', ' dementia care giver ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' Formal care giving ', ' Formal caregiving ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' symptomatology ', ' recruit ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,769755,0.09672405494818417
"Access to Community Based Palliative Care among Medically-Underserved Older Adults ABSTRACT Exploring the palliative care needs of medically underserved older adults  in East and Central Harlem As Americans live longer and the proportion of people 65 years of age and older grows from 14% of the population to 20% by midcentury, the growing incidence of age-related chronic illnesses will increasingly represent a critical public health concern. An estimated 80% of older adults have one chronic illness or condition (e.g., cancer, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias), and half of older adults experience two or more of these conditions. Chronic conditions are frequently accompanied by high symptom burden, including pain, fatigue, mobility problems, anxiety and depression, which are associated with diminished self-rated health and quality of life, frequent use of costly healthcare services, and ultimately threaten the ability to live independently. Palliative care has emerged as an effective strategy to address the profound human and economic costs of living with chronic and advanced illness. A substantial body of evidence suggests that delivering early, high-quality palliative care to this population significantly improves patient outcomes across critical domains by reducing pain and symptoms, enhancing patient and caregiver wellbeing, lengthening survival, and containing overall health care costs for the highest need users. Despite these promising outcomes, there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in access to high quality palliative care, particularly among older adults living in low-income communities. This longitudinal, mixed-method study explores the experiences and supportive care needs of community-dwelling chronically-ill African American and Latino older adults after discharge to the community from an inpatient palliative care service. The specific aims are to: 1) describe the needs and perceptions of chronically-ill, low- income African-American and Latino older adults living in the community, the conditions and contexts under which they access high quality palliative care, and the barriers they face in accessing and using palliative care post-discharge; 2) explore palliative care providers' perceptions of underserved older adults' needs for palliative care, and the strategies providers use to access these individuals and provide them with needed services; and 3) shed light on the mechanisms that explain palliative care disparities, and suggest strategies to advance culturally competent, measurable, and sustained improvements in coordination of comprehensive palliative care for community-dwelling African-American and Latino older adults. Overall, the study will advance our scientific understanding of palliative care disparities and help reduce multi-level barriers to meeting the needs of all community-dwelling older adults with chronic and advanced illness. Successful achievement of these aims will enhance our understanding of the barriers and facilitators to palliative care and suggest factors to expand these services to a growing population of underserved community-dwelling older adults. Findings from these exploratory data will form the basis of an R01 application to further develop and pilot innovative interventions to better meet the palliative care needs of chronically-ill, low-income African American and Latino older adults in the community. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE STATEMENT This study will contribute to the understanding of underlying causes of significant racial and ethnic disparities in access to and utilization of high-quality palliative care among community-dwelling, low-income African American and Latino older adults. Grounded in a multifactorial framework of micro-, mezzo- and macro-level influences, the study integrates community-based participatory research and grounded theory approaches to elicit the unique perspectives of ethnically diverse palliative care patients and palliative care providers at a public community hospital. An increased understanding of barriers and facilitators to palliative care will contribute to development of interventions that expand this critical resource to underserved community- dwelling older adults, thus addressing serious health disparities experienced by this population.",Access to Community Based Palliative Care among Medically-Underserved Older Adults,9551665,SC2GM121269,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Anxiety ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Communities ', ' Living Costs ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Palliative Care ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family member ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Palliative Medicine ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' advanced disease ', ' advanced illness ', ' economic cost ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' medically underserved ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' family support ', ' caregiver wellbeing ', ' care giver wellbeing ', ' care giver well-being ', ' Caregiver well-being ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' painful symptom ', ' pain symptom ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain reduction ', ' ']",NIGMS,HUNTER COLLEGE,SC2,2018,156000,0.18873013883164058
"Disparity in Incidence and Health Outcomes between Rural and Urban Patients with Alzheimers disease and related disorders ABSTRACT  By 2030, over 20% of the US population will be at least 65 years old, the age at which incidence of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) begins to increase. In 2014, 17% of the population living in rural areas was already over the age of 65, suggesting that rural populations may be disproportionally affected by ADRD in current and coming years. There is growing evidence that disparities in disease burden as well as availability, accessibility, affordability, and acceptability of health services exist among older adults living in rural areas, likely contributing to the growing gap in life expectancy witnessed between urban and rural communities. Previous studies have found that ADRD prevalence rates vary by gender, race, and ethnicity, yet few studies have examined disparities in diagnosis and outcomes of older adults living in urban and rural areas. Studies that have examined rural health disparities related to ADRD have largely focused on issues related to access to care, and suggest that ADRD patients in rural areas are more likely to receive suboptimal healthcare. There is a gap in our knowledge on how place of residence influences diagnosis and subsequent outcomes of older adults with ADRD. Understanding if disparities exist for older adults with ADRD living in rural areas could yield important insights into the risk factors for ADRD, the variables influencing the experience of living with ADRD, and the methods by which they can be more effectively managed. The objective of this application, the first step toward this long-term goal, is to conduct a population based study and thorough analysis to identify if rural-urban disparities in the diagnostic incidence and prevalence of ADRD, healthcare utilization, and health outcomes exist. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that rural Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD will be diagnosed later in the course of their disease and experience worse health outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work that shows the prevalence rate of ADRD is lower, yet the mortality rate due to ADRD is higher in states with a higher share of its population living in rural areas. To achieve this objective, we propose two aims. First, we will compare the diagnostic incidence and prevalence of ADRD between Medicare beneficiaries living in rural and urban communities. Second, we will compare survival and trajectories of acute, nursing home and home health care use in six years following the initial diagnosis of ADRD between rural and urban beneficiaries. We propose to study fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries in 2008-2015 integrating Medicare enrollment, claims, and resident assessment data. Findings of this study have several expected benefits for many. For policy makers, this research will enable evidence-based policy development aimed at improving rural health care. For rural health providers, this work will drive efforts to improve ADRD screening in order to ensure rural beneficiaries receive a timely diagnosis, which may delay future adverse outcomes. For rural health systems, these findings will help plan for future demand and understand gaps in our current system in meeting this population's needs.

"Activity Space, Social Interaction and Health Trajectories in Later Life ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central goal of this research program is to describe the social and spatial environments in which older adults spend their time. We focus on the extent to which this activity space influences health trajectories. We theorize that the components of the person-environment relationship, including household, neighborhood, and network contexts, are interrelated and mutually constituted. We aim to 1) describe the activity space that older adults inhabit, and 2) explore the extent to which activity space, and the network, household, and neighborhood exposures related to it, affect short-term and pre-clinical changes in health. We will collect primary, multi-wave data from 600 Chicagoans aged 65 and older. We incorporate reports of network connectedness and activity tracking across physical space using GPS methodology. By equipping respondents with smart phones, we are able to collect real-time data on latitude, longitude and distance traveled. We use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology to obtain respondents' reports of their social settings, health status, health behaviors, and well- being. In-person interviews will obtain self-reported and objective indices of health, including body mass index and a salivary measure to assess chronic stress exposure. A particularly innovative feature of this study is the ability to capture changes n quotidian symptoms, potentially indicative of chronic disease onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tracking older adults' movements-in, out of, and across their communities-will provide insight into their span of engagement, the contexts most relevant for their health and well-being, and their access to social and community resources. These dynamic data, coupled with frequent multi-dimensional health assessments, combine to form an unprecedented opportunity to examine the mechanisms through which social context affects health across time.","Activity Space, Social Interaction and Health Trajectories in Later Life",9519794,R01AG050605,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Attention ', ' Chicago ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Household ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methodology ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Saliva ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Socialization ', ' Sociology ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Body Measures ', ' Body measure procedure ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Fostering ', ' Inequality ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Physical assessment ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Nature ', ' Empirical Research ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Salivary ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' respiratory ', ' Services ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' cohesion ', ' family structure ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Consequentialism ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' social engagement ', ' data resource ', ' health assessment ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL OPINION RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,606513,0.08420753494363625
"Cohort differences in social life and health:  Refreshing the NSHAP sample DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP) is a longitudinal study of older adults designed to examine the mechanisms by which social factors-such as intimate relationships and social networks-affect and are affected by health. In 2005-06, questionnaire and biomeasure data were collected from a nationally- representative sample of 3,005 community-dwelling adults ages 57-85 (W1). These referent respondents were reinterviewed in 2010-11, together with coresident spouses/partners (W2). A third wave (W3), to be collected in 2015-16, will reinterview all surviving referent respondents and W2 spouses/partners. Collectively, NSHAP's W1, W2 and W3 provide extensive, longitudinal, health and social information for a nationally representative sample of older adults. We aim to add a new cohort to the NSHAP sample to capture the unique and epidemiologically intriguing ""Baby Boom"" cohort. Funding for refreshing the sample with a new cohort of aging ""Baby Boomers"" (i.e., respondents born from 1948 through 1965) will substantially increase the value of NSHAP for various research communities, opening up key avenues for conducting innovative and effective health related research, such as: (1) comparing the social connections, networks, environment and relationships of older adults in different birth cohorts and the relationship of these social factors with health; (2) tracing cohort differences in the life courseof cohabitations and marital relationships; (3) comparing trajectories of physical function, self-rate health, health behaviors, prevalence of chronic diseases, and physiological functioning across ages over birth cohorts; (4) tracking the transition from middle-age to older ages; and (5) capturing racial and ethnic differences in the ages at which relevant chronic conditions become prevalent across cohorts.  Funding will support adding over 2,500 respondents. The addition of respondents ages 50 to 67 in 2015- 16 will provide a nationally-representative, high-quality data set on social relationships and health for ages 50 to 95, setting the stage for a sequential cohort design. The addition of the Baby Boom cohort will allow researchers to compare health and social outcomes along age, period, and cohort axes. We will harmonize data collection with W3 of NSHAP to form a single, cohesive dataset, including in-home interviews with 1,600 new respondents born between 1948-1965 and their spouses or co-residential romantic partners (n=900). This will yield extensive, nationally representative, self-reported and biomeasure data on multiple cohorts' physical and mental health, physical and cognitive functioning, medication use, and pathways of health and mortality within social contexts, facilitating comparative assessments of health disparities between gender, race, ethnicity and socio- economic status by age within and across cohorts.

"Diabetes and Prediabetes in Older Adults in ARIC ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults are at increased risk for diabetes but there is controversy regarding prognosis in prediabetes and diabetes, appropriate screening and treatment targets, and how best to reduce cardiovascular risk and prevent cognitive and physical impairment, especially in persons aged 70 years or higher. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study is an ongoing, community-based study of 15,792 participants originally recruited in 1987-1989. For over 25 years, ARIC investigators have conducted detailed assessments of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors including diabetes. At the most recent visit 5 (2011- 2013), the mean age of participants was 75 years, 23% were black, and 33% of participants had diagnosed diabetes. New visits in ARIC are planned from 2016 to 2019. This application is a request for funding of an approved ARIC ancillary study to add key diabetes-related measures to the upcoming visits. Aims: 1) Quantify the risk of incident prediabetes and diabetes in older black and white adults using multiple biomarkers; 2) Characterize the risk of clinical microvascular and macrovascular outcomes in older adults with diabetes, paying particular attention to differences in risk in older onset compared to middle-aged onset diabetes; 3) Characterize the association of prediabetes with risk of clinical and subclinical and clinical outcomes in older adults including physical and cognitive dysfunction; 4) Identify risk factors for hypoglycemia in older adults with diabetes and its associations with cardiovascular risk, mortality, and cognition. We will also evaluate the associations of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia with neuropathy, care practices, diabetes awareness and treatment satisfaction. Design and Methods: We will collect biospecimens from over 4,000 ARIC participants at the upcoming visits and conduct measurements of standard and nontraditional biomarkers of hyperglycemia, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. We will also conduct new assessments of hypoglycemia, neuropathy, preventive care practices, and diabetes treatment satisfaction. The proposed assessments will add over 5 years of additional follow-up (from visit 5) and will take advantage of ongoing surveillance for all hospitalizations, adjudicatin of cardiovascular and other events, and linkage to Medicare data. Significance: This competing renewal is designed to address long-standing controversies in the field and inform our understanding of the burden and clinical implications of prediabetes and diabetes in older adults. We will shed light on prognosis in heterogeneous glycemic subgroups and the performance of different markers of hyperglycemia. The data generated will provide evidence to assist clinicians in formulating more specific recommendations regarding testing, prognosis, and race- and age-related differences in risk associated with diabetes in older age. Results of this study will have direct relevance to clinical practice and inform strategies for the management of diabetes in older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetes is common in older adults but there are major uncertainty regarding how to best identify, treat, and manage diabetes in this population. This study will address major controversies in the field regarding the health effects of elevated glucose in older adults.

"Addressing Disparities in Healthcare Access and Outcomes among Chronically Ill Older Adults: Assessing the Feasibility of an Agent-Based Modeling Approach Project Summary Prior research shows persistently greater burden of illness and poorer access to care among racial minorities and low-income individuals; older adults with chronic illness are no exception. Although evidence on the social determinants of health has grown, many questions remain about the complex interplay of individual, organizational, and environmental factors in health disparities generally, and in healthcare access and outcomes in particular. This developmental study will assess the feasibility of using a state-of-the-art systems science method – Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) – to examine and address the complex array of factors contributing to racial and socio-economic disparities in healthcare access and outcomes among chronically ill older adults. We will capitalize on an existing dataset that includes three years of health care claims on a cohort of 278,820 New York City-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 and older with diabetes, heart failure and/or hypertension linked with data on neighborhood characteristics (e.g. supply of primary care and federally qualified health centers, neighborhood walkability, and transit access). Applying ABMS to the existing data could establish the groundwork for developing a decision-support tool to guide interventions in health disparities; however, it is essential to first identify the most influential factors in each level of analysis and how they interact. Focusing on the three levels of analysis needed to build a prototype agent-based model, the specific aims are to assess the feasibility of:  (1) developing an individual-level agent model with the available data on demographics (e.g. race, age, low  income), diagnoses, patterns of outpatient healthcare use and outcomes (e.g. hospitalizations for  ambulatory care-sensitive conditions, emergency department visits);  (2) modeling the organization of health services across the care continuum by combining data on  sequencing and intensity of service delivery and health care supply; and  (3) developing a neighborhood-level model that includes socio-demographic composition, walkability, public  transit, safety, amenities and social services as environmental determinants of healthcare access and outcomes. This study will determine whether agent-based modeling is feasible for capturing the multiple dimensions of phenomena that influence healthcare access and outcomes among vulnerable populations. This work would lay a foundation for a larger study that includes simulation of promising interventions using an expanded dataset that could include both Medicare and Medicaid claims for services delivered since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a model that serves as a decision support tool to guide policy and practice interventions at the provider and/or community level to improve the health of underserved populations of older adults with chronic illness and, in turn, reduce health disparities. Project Narrative Among the growing numbers of older adults with chronic illness, racial minorities and low-income individuals frequently have poorer access to care and worse health outcomes overall.

"PAST-DUE (Prevention and Social Determinants: Disparities and Utilization in Latino Elders) Project Summary/Abstract  Americans aged 60 and over underutilize recommended preventive healthcare. Older Latino-Americans underutilize preventive services to an even greater degree than non-Hispanic whites, but the factors that drive this disparity most heavily are poorly understood. Some evidence in the health services literature suggests that social determinants of health (individual- and community-level economic, social, and environmental factors) affect utilization of preventive health care. It is uncertain, however, which specific services may be most underused by older Latinos, and which social determinants are most strongly associated with this group's utilization.  The dearth of knowledge about social determinants and preventive service utilization in older Latinos is due, at least in part, to the lack of comprehensive data on ambulatory health care utilization linked to data on individual- and community-level social determinants of health. This project will assess disparities in preventive service use between older Latinos and older non-Hispanic Whites, and identify the factors underlying those disparities. To do so, we will leverage a unique data resource from a large, national network of community health centers with shared electronic health record data that is linked to community-level social determinants of health data. This large, longitudinal dataset contains unprecedented data linkages which will let us assess disparities, evaluate which social determinants affect utilization and disparities, and determine which of these may do so most significantly over time; in so doing, we will address an important knowledge gap. Understanding the factors (individual or community) that most heavily impact preventive service use is crucial to the prioritization of population-based interventions to improve preventive screening.  Understanding the relative impact of social determinants of health on preventive service use in older Latinos will enable action/intervention in three ways: 1. It will enable more informed policy decisions to improve public health and wellness in older Americans. 2. It will facilitate strategic partnerships between healthcare providers and community agencies poised to intervene in social factors in the lives of older Americans. 3. It will help clinical providers understand their patients' barriers to care utilization, and further point-of-care efforts to address these barriers that influence their older patients' utilization of recommended health care services. Project Narrative  Many demographic and social factors affect the health of older Latinos in the United States, in part by impacting the use of recommended preventive health care. However, it is unknown which specific factors affect the use of specific preventive care in elders most significantly. This project will use a highly innovative, linked database that combines electronic health care data and community-level information to better understand which social factors most heavily affect the use of preventive care among Latino seniors.",PAST-DUE (Prevention and Social Determinants: Disparities and Utilization in Latino Elders),9514607,R01AG056337,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Americas ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Economics ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Language ', ' Literature ', ' Nomads ', ' Migrant ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' Community Health Networks ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' care seeking ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Preventative screening ', ' Preventive screening ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' service utilization ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' social health determinants ', ' screening ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' health data ', ' built environment ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventive health care ', ' Preventative healthcare ', ' Preventative health care ', ' Preventive healthcare ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' health care community ', ' healthcare community ', ' fracture risk ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' data resource ', ' patient barriers ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' ']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,523240,0.012098677050760403
"The University of Florida Jacksonville Aging Studies Center (JAX-ASCENT) Summary Older adults of racial minorities and low socioeconomic (SES) status represent particularly high risk populations who are underserved and are significantly underrepresented in clinical research. This has led to a gap in knowledge regarding the appropriate and/or optimal prevention and treatment approaches for this high risk group. Within the state of Florida, the city of Jacksonville (JAX) has a high proportion of minority and low SES individuals. By expanding existing research collaborations on both aging and health disparities at its JAX site, the University of Florida (UF) has a unique opportunity to conduct important research that can reduce this knowledge gap. These existing relationships include partnership in conducting multi-center NIH-funded clinical trials, along with several community outreach efforts both at UF Gainesville (GNV) and JAX. However, there is currently no cohesive, organized resource to integrate these important research collaborations in aging and health disparities at UF-JAX. At the UF GNV campus, we have a strong clinical translational research infrastructure with the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center, Clinical Translational Science Institute and Disparities Research. In JAX, UF has a large health care facility in a densely populated minority and low SES area, but limited research infrastructure focused on aging research. To fully actualize the potential of this remarkable resource, we propose to develop a dedicated center for aging research focused on racial minorities and low SES older adults. This state-of-the-art clinical translational research facility for multidisciplinary research Jacksonville Aging Studies CENTer (JAX-ASCENT) will closely partner with the UF GNV campus and capitalize on our expertise and resources. Additionally, JAX-ASCENT will create an integrative physical and intellectual environment in which trainees at all levels and scientists from diverse disciplines can interact and conduct clinical and behavioral translational research on aging and independence of older adults. This focus will be pursued using an interdisciplinary approach that traverses a broad spectrum of biomedical investigation, including clinical research, behavioral sciences, social sciences, epidemiology, biostatistics, and health services, while implementing rigor and transparency in research. We will develop and partner regarding expertise on clinical trials, recruitment, adherence, retention, assessment of geriatric outcomes, biomarkers, and behavioral studies all focused and tailored on research in urban minorities and low SES older adults. We will apply a conceptual/logic model of community-based participatory research partnerships to improve community involvement and health outcomes, and to build a research participants registry. We will develop the physical and human infrastructure, mentor junior faculty towards leadership roles, and have JAX-ASCENT become self-sustaining. JAX-ASCENT will expand knowledge in clinical translational research in largely understudied populations and both enlarge and enrich the diversity of research in older minority populations, clinical effectiveness, outcomes, and community engagement programs at UF. Narrative With the development of JAX-ASCENT, we will provide resources and personnel (including NIH funded investigators) to support the development and implementation of behavioral, nutritional, and pharmacologic clinical trials, and observational studies of social determinants of health contributing to chronic diseases and functional decline in underserved, minority and low SES older adults. The JAX-ASCENT will fill a critical gap in knowledge regarding the translation and dissemination of research from efficacy studies to underserved, minority older adults who are at high risk of

"Finding Solutions for Disparities Associated with Star Ratings Established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Star Ratings system for Medicare Parts C&D (Star Ratings, hereafter) is a health plan quality reporting system with associated bonus payments and enrollment incentives for health plans since 2012. Researchers have reported the disparity implications of Star Ratings: e.g., racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to be excluded from measure calculation for diabetes adherence than non-Hispanic whites, thus minorities may be more likely to be excluded from quality improvement initiations for this measure, potentially worsening disparities in health. A critical barrier for resolving such disparities is that comprehensive policy recommendation related to effects of Star Ratings on racial/ethnic disparities is not available. The goals of this project are to ensure that Star Ratings include a set of measures that address disparities in measure calculation, and to evaluate the effects of Star Ratings bonus payments on reducing racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization. Our strategies are to (1) add to Star Ratings medication utilization measures selected from Pharmacy Quality Alliance measure concept inventory (PMCI), and other commonly used medication utilization (CUMU) measures (Star Plus, hereafter), and (2) compare racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization before and after the implementation of bonus payments, and between counties with “double bonuses” and those with regular bonuses. A project focusing on only medication utilization measures in Star Ratings is warranted because these measures account for a high percentage in Star Ratings scores (45% in Part D in 2013) and their correlation with other measures is only moderate. Bonus payments are associated with improved plan benefit structure, which may reduce racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization. In the prior grant period we found that selecting appropriate medication utilization measures may resolve racial/ethnic disparities associated with a Medicare Part D policy. Our objective of this continuation project is to conduct an analysis of Medicare Parts A/B/D data (2010-2015), linked to Area Health Resources Files, Orange Book Data Files, and CMS data on double/regular-bonus counties. We will also conduct disease-specific analysis. Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that using the medication utilization measures in current Star Ratings negatively affects the health of racial/ethnic minorities. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that using Star Plus can lead to a reduction in racial/ethnic disparities associated with Star Ratings. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that the Star Ratings bonus payments are associated with reduction in racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization. Our expected outcome is to provide policy recommendations to resolve important disparity issues in Star Ratings among diverse older adults. Impact: This project will help to align disparity reduction goals with rapidly-proliferating pay-for-performance and public-reporting initiatives. This project is responsive to the National Institute on Aging's mission-driven strategic goal to “understand health disparities and develop strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations.” The goals of this project are to evaluate effects of Medicare Parts C&D Star Ratings (Star Ratings, hereafter) bonus payments on racial and ethnic disparities and ensure that Star Ratings include a set of measures that address the disparities in measure calculation. Our expected outcome is to produce comprehensive policy recommendations to resolve important disparity issues in Star Ratings among older adults in diverse populations. Our project will (1) provide the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services with information needed to align disparity reduction goals with rapidly-proliferating pay-for-performance and public-reporting initiatives; and (2) provide the National Institute on Aging with support to achieve its strategic goal of “understanding health disparities and develop strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations.”",Finding Solutions for Disparities Associated with Star Ratings,9594030,R01AG049696,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Books ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' health-care expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Incentives ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Medicare Part A ', ' Medicare Hospital Insurance Program ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Data Files ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Quality Indicator ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' Stretching ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' Medicare Part C ', ' Medicare Plus Choice ', ' Medicare Choice ', ' Structure ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Oranges ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Proliferating ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Concept Inventory ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' health plans ', ' health plan ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2018,334400,0.021554965263151562
"A Practice-based Intervention to Improve Care for Women with Urinary Incontinence PROJECT SUMMARY The burden of urinary incontinence (UI) on American women is immense in human and financial terms, and continues to rise with the growing population of older adults. The goal of this proposal is to improve the care for UI provided to women and, in doing so, decrease the utilization of specialty care while improving patient outcomes. Specific Aim 1 seeks to improve the quality of incontinence care provided to an ethnically diverse population of women through a controlled practice-based intervention involving primary care providers. Three Southern California medical groups will participate in a cluster randomized controlled trial in which 40 offices (12-14 per site) will be randomized to undergo a practice-based incontinence intervention led by a urologist/urogynecologist ”clinical champion” who is a member of that specific medical group. The intervention will include physician education, individual performance feedback, electronic decision support, and patient education. The quality of patient care, as evidenced by compliance with the quality indicators, will be measured across the two randomized arms after implementation of the intervention. The investigators for this proposal recently developed and pilot-tested a set of quality-of-care indicators (QIs) for urinary incontinence that encompass care provided at both the generalist and specialist level. Compliance with these quality indicators will be the key means to measure quality. In addition, in Specific Aim 2, utilization of specialists will be compared before and after the intervention. The investigators hypothesize that improved care at the level of the primary care physician will reduce the number of specialty referrals. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will seek to measure the effect of the intervention on patient outcomes. Under the hypothesis that a practice-based intervention will improve disease-specific outcomes, symptom severity and quality of life will be measured at baseline by the urogenital distress inventory-short form (UDI-6) and the incontinence impact questionnaire- short form (IIQ-7). After implementation of the intervention, these questionnaires will be given a second time and outcomes will be compared between control and intervention groups. We expect that this intervention will also reduce disparities in care for ethnic minorities.

"The Burden of Care for Adults with Dementia: Impact on Care Quality and Family Outcomes Project Abstract: Care for older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) during the final years of life is extremely costly and families carry a high share of this burden. Costs and shifting patterns of year-over-year spending are likely associated with adverse care quality and family financial outcomes, yet to date individual- level, comprehensive, longitudinal data on spending and its effect on outcomes have not been examined. Existing data also demonstrate that those vulnerable subgroups least able to cope are at greatest financial risk, which may result in further disparities in outcomes. Therefore, this project aims to understand the magnitude of this healthcare spending and its distribution across payers and families over time and how this spending contributes to disparities in care quality and family outcomes among older adults with dementia, particularly among vulnerable and underserved populations. The study will assemble data that capture total healthcare spending and proportion by payer (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, individuals, families, and others), using the nationally-representative Health and Retirement Study and linked Medicare and Medicaid claims data. Specifically, the project will 1) Compare yearly patterns of total health-related costs and proportion of costs paid by Medicare, Medicaid, out-of-pocket, informal caregiving, and other payers, in each of the last 5 years of life among older adults with or without ADRD and across vulnerable subgroups; 2) Test if out-of-pocket costs exceeding household wealth are associated with indicators of care quality (nursing home admission for long- term care, ≥3 transitions across care sites in the last 90 days of life, suboptimal hospice use, i.e. enrollment >6 months or <3 days, and in-hospital death) among older adults with or without ADRD and across vulnerable subgroups; and 3) Examine if out-of-pocket costs exceeding household wealth are associated with potentially adverse intergenerational family financial outcomes (cohabitation, caregiving and financial support by adult children) among older adults with or without ADRD and across vulnerable subgroups. The results will directly inform health and social policy, and help to ensure high quality care for older adults with ADRD, while avoiding impoverishment of families and compounding of racial and socioeconomic disparities. Project Narrative: This project seeks to better understand the burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias on individuals, their families, and society and particularly those belonging to vulnerable social and demographic subgroups. We will examine individuals' health-related costs across all payers (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, individuals, families, and others), year-over-year, among older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, compared to those without dementia, and assess how spending influences both care quality and family outcomes. The results of this study will inform effective health and social policies that will ensure high quality care for elders with dementias and better distribute public and private healthcare resources.",The Burden of Care for Adults with Dementia: Impact on Care Quality and Family Outcomes,9479675,R01AG054540,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' cost shifting ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Family ', ' Financial Support ', ' financial assistance ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Persons ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Privatization ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Policies ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Unmarried ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' exhaust ', ' Site ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' exhaustion ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' intergenerational ', ' high school ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Adult Children ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' longterm care for elderly ', ' elder care ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' care burden ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' financial incentive ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' informal care ', ' Informal care giving ', ' informal caregiving ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,423750,0.030742853886729215
"Communities Designed to Support Cardiovascular Health for Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Business establishments have the potential to shape individual behaviors including dietary intake, physical activity patterns, and management of chronic medical conditions, all with relevance to risk of myocardial infarction and related cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Policy strategies targeting local businesses may play an important role in CVD prevention, extending years of healthy life, and facilitating independent living. We propose to bring together commercially available ""big data"" and detailed population-based cohort data to examine the role of local business environments in CVD and racial disparities in CVD as they emerged across decades. Longitudinal studies of local environments have been strongly recommended as a direction for future research to advance our understanding of causal neighborhood effects on health. The local density of businesses with potential relevance to CVD has changed over time, and such temporal fluctuations vary across regions, cities and neighborhoods. These differences can be used to investigate how residentially stable older adults are affected by their local context. Meanwhile, older adults who relocate to a new home address may respond to their new context by changing health behaviors, offering another window into causation. However, careful attention is needed to acute health changes that precipitate relocation, and which local environment features predict aging in place despite new health or functional limitations. In the proposed project, we will link longitudinal data to investigate how neighborhood change and residential relocation shape cardiovascular health and health disparities. We will use a census of national businesses, the National Establishment Time Series (NETS). NETS data for all 52.4 million US business establishments includes annual point-level geocodes and business characteristics for the years 1990-2012, offering an unprecedented opportunity to characterize changing business environments nationally at multiple spatial scales. Geographic context data (from NETS as well as longitudinal population, safety, and transportation data) will be linked to individual data from two ongoing cohort studies: the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study. CHS is a well-characterized population- based study of 5,888 older adults (100% age 65+ at baseline, 58% female, 16% African American). A majority of the CHS participants enrolled 1990-1993 from four US sites, with         oversampling of African Americans, have been followed prospectively for the remainder of their lives, allowing in-depth characterization of neighborhood environments experienced by older adults in their final decades. REGARDS is also a prospective population-based cohort study with oversampling of African Americans, allowing for examination of racial disparities. However, the 30,239 REGARDS participants (49% age 65+ at baseline, 55% female, 42% African American) were enrolled more recently (2003-2007) and from a broader geographic region (48 contiguous US states, oversampling Stroke Belt residents). For these two cohorts with complementary strengths, cardiovascular events have been ascertained and longitudinal address data collected. This project brings together unparalleled data resources, builds on a track record of policy-relevant work with large geographic data resources, and leverages comprehensive cardiovascular cohort data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Businesses represent sources of food, walking destinations, and opportunities to access medical care. These aspects of the local environment have the potential to support healthy lifestyles, heart health, and independent living for an aging population. Following recommendations to study how neighborhood change affects health, this project brings together (1) unparalleled neighborhood data on all 52.4 million US businesses from 1990-2012, (2)

"Risk Factors for Social Isolation Among African American Older Adults R36 Dissertation Proposal Abstract: Risk Factors for Social Isolation among African American Older Adults BACKGROUND: Social isolation is a significant public health issue among older adults in the United States. It is related to a host of negative health outcomes including mortality, worse self- rated physical health, higher depressive symptoms, worse sleep quality, and cognitive decline. Factors associated with social isolation among older adults include living alone, experiencing a significant life change, living in a rural community, belonging to a cultural minority group, having low income, and having severe physical and/or mental disabilities. To the investigator’s knowledge, there are few studies which examine social isolation among African American older adults, few studies that examine risk factors for social isolation among African American older adults, and one study that distinguishes between objective and subjective isolation among older African Americans. The aims of the proposed study are: 1) to determine the risk factors associated with objective and subjective social isolation among older African Americans; and 2) to determine if risk factors associated with objective and subjective social isolation among older African Americans vary by age, gender, and living in a rural or urban environment. The theoretical model which influenced the development of the proposed study is the Convoy Model of Social Relations. The investigator hypothesizes that increases in objective isolation and subjective isolation will be associated with several risk factors, including lower education, lower income, worse self-rated health, increasing neighborhood physical disorder, and decreasing neighborhood social cohesion. Additionally, the investigator hypotheses that risk factors for social isolation among African American older adults vary by age, gender, and living in a rural or urban environment. METHODS: The aims of the proposed study will be addressed using the Health and Retirement Study, Leave Behind Questionnaire dataset, 2008 and 2012 waves. Objective isolation will be operationalized using the social network index, and subjective isolation will be operationalized using the Hughes and colleagues 3 item loneliness scale. Descriptive statistics, T-Tests, ANOVAs, and multivariate regression analyses using lagged variables will be calculated. In general, social isolation at 2012 is regressed on social isolation and all risk factors in 2008. Additionally, interaction terms, testing the moderating effects of age, gender, and living in a rural or urban environment, will be used to address the study aims. Knowledge generated from the proposed study will be useful for designing ethnically tailored social isolation risk assessments, tailored isolation reducing interventions, and for policy and program development to decrease isolation among all older adults. This proposal is responsive to PAR-17-025 Aging Research Dissertation Awards to Increase Diversity. R36 Proposal Project Narrative: Risk Factors for Social Isolation among African American Older Adults Social isolation is associated with many negative health outcomes among older adults, and there are few studies which have examined differences in risk factors for social isolation among older African Americans. Older African Americans have a projected population growth of 99% between now and 2030, have an increased risk for becoming socially isolated, and are less likely to utilize health services in comparison to older Whites. Knowledge gained from the proposed study will be useful for creating ethnically tailored social isolation risk assessments, tailored isolation reducing interventions, and policy and program development to decrease isolation among African American older adults.",Risk Factors for Social Isolation Among African American Older Adults,9455424,R36AG054647,"['Academy ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Climacteric ', ' life change ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Household ', ' indexing ', ' Institutes ', ' Life Experience ', ' Literature ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Marital Status ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Population Growth ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' World Health ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Rural Community ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Respondent ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Consequentialism ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Sum ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' two-dimensional ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' social engagement ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' rural environment ', ' sleep quality ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R36,2018,44034,0.19143676093789935
"Access and use of long-term services and supports for older adults living alone with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias from four racial/ethnic groups ABSTRACT More than one million older adults (age >65) with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), i.e. almost one-third of the ADRD population in the United States, live alone. Older racial/ethnic minorities are likely to make up a considerable proportion of older adults with ADRD living alone because they are at an increased risk for ADRD compared to Whites. In addition, living alone in old age is common across races and ethnicities. Previous studies, primarily of older Whites, have shown that older adults with ADRD living alone are at greater risk than those living with others for untreated medical conditions, self-neglect, malnutrition, falls, and fires. Older adults living alone who develop ADRD are less likely to receive a diagnosis, and thus may also be at risk for delayed access to essential long-term services and supports (LTSS). Access to LTSS is critical to older adults with ADRD who are living alone because they lack cohabitants to compensate for their diminished capacity for cognitively demanding skills that are essential to living alone. Despite these concerning findings, the contribution of living alone and its associated challenges in older racial/ethnic minorities with ADRD in accessing and using LTSS are unknown. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate specific barriers and facilitators to access and use of LTSS among older adults with ADRD living alone, and to examine how such barriers and facilitators may differ by racial/ethnic group and by living arrangement. To gain a multidimensional and in-depth understanding of these barriers and facilitators, we will conduct a mixed methods study to test the hypothesis that, for older adults with ADRD, living alone is a critical barrier to accessing and using LTSS, compared to those who live with others. Building on the Goldberg-Huxley pathway model, we will identify barriers and facilitators to accessing and using LTSS at community-, provider-, and system-levels of analysis. The proposed project has three specific aims. Aim 1. We will leverage rich data from the Health and Retirement Study to quantify risk factors in accessing and using LTSS for people with ADRD, by race/ethnicity and by living arrangement. Aim 2. To identify and understand, in depth, barriers and facilitators to LTSS we will interview older adults with ADRD, including their informants. We will include equal numbers of Asians, Latinos, non-Latino Blacks, and non-Latino Whites who live alone (n=200), stratifying by living arrangements (alone vs. with others). To identify barriers and facilitators at a system and provider level, we will also interview administrators and providers of LTSS. Aim 3. We will integrate qualitative and quantitative findings to develop policy recommendations in consultation with policy experts. Our interdisciplinary team is well-positioned to succeed in this research, as we have developed specific expertise in interviewing diverse older adults with cognitive impairment living alone. Overall, our results will identify key barriers and facilitators accessing and using LTSS for older adults with ADRD across races/ethnicities and living arrangements, that will inform development of targeted policies. PROJECT NARRATIVE A substantial proportion of the growing elderly population have Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (ADRD), and their progressive daily challenges to meeting essential needs (e.g., managing finances, medication, transportation) are exacerbated when they live alone and thus lack cohabitants who can compensate for the cognitive impairment, leading to emergent problems including untreated medical conditions, self-neglect, malnutrition, falls, and fires. To help address this large and growing problem, the proposed research will elucidate key barriers and facilitators to accessing and using long-term services and supports (LTSS) for older adults, focusing on those of racial/ethnic minorities with ADRD who live alone, who we hypothesize experience the greatest barriers to accessing and using LTSS. The results of this study will help direct increased focus of the scientific community, community leaders, and policymakers to the role of living arrangements in exacerbating health disparities. 1",Access and use of long-term services and supports for older adults living alone with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias from four racial/ethnic groups,9784933,R56AG062165,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Goals ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nutrition ', ' Politics ', ' Privatization ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' falls ', ' Administrator ', ' Latino ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Malnutrition ', ' density ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Homemaker-Home Health Aides ', ' Home Care Aides ', ' Home Health Aides ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' self-neglect ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' cultural competence ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' health data ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R56,2018,617406,0.12015456218884893
"Epidemiology of Psychological Distress in Chinese Aging Population This goal of our project is to conduct an epidemiological study to elucidate the relationship between culture factors and psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults. More specifically, we will examine the trajectory of psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults, to quantify the relation between normative responsibilities with their psychological wellbeing, to quantify the degree of influence to which normative responsibilities influences health-related factors associated with psychological wellbeing, and to examine the gender differences. Our secondary aims are to explore the feasibilities of testing the inter-relations between subjective and physiological measures of psychological wellbeing; and to explore the socio-cultural context in the normative responsibilities. Chinese aging population is increasing rapidly in US and globally. However, there are marked health disparities, especially surround the issues of psychological wellbeing, suicide, violence and elder mistreatment (elder abuse, neglect, financial exploitation and self-neglect). In addition, there are linguistic and cultural complexities and nuances when studying these issues. Moreover, there has been inadequate grass-root support necessary to empower and enable the Chinese communities to fully participate in the research process as equal partners on culturally sensitive issues. Accordingly, we will build on our prior community-based participatory research to quantify the mechanisms between important cultural factors and the trajectory of psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults. In this application, a culturally capable principal investigator and a multi-institutional interdisciplinary team will build on our prior efforts to collaborate with Chinese community organizations. The findings from this proposal could inform health care professionals, researcher, community, and policy makers to identify risk/protective factors, better understand disease pathway, inform future prevention and intervention studies, and inform the practice and policy to improve psychological wellbeing in Chinese older adults. Public Health Relevance:  This proposal will conduct an epidemiological study to quantify the trajectory of older adult's psychological wellbeing and to examine factors associated with filial responsibilities, family conflict, and psychological wellbeing in Chinese older men and women.

"Risk and mechanisms of neurocognitive impairment in older HIV-infected Hispanics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) continues to be highly prevalent and debilitating in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, particularly among older persons. Hispanics are the fastest growing segment of the older adult population in the U.S., they are disproportionately represented among cases of HIV infection, and they are at elevated risk for NCI in both HIV and older age, separately. Yet, NCI among older HIV-infected Hispanics has not been examined. This Mentored Career Development Award (K23) application is designed to develop the applicant's skills to become an independent and culturally proficient clinical scientist investigating the role of risk factors for the development of NCI associated wit combined HIV infection and aging among Hispanics. The application contains a targeted research project to examine NCI in older HIV-infected Hispanics (primarily of Mexican origin/descent) and key factors driving ethnic differences in NCI associated with HIV and aging. Elucidation of psychosocial and biomedical factors that might lead to ethnic differences in NCI is a foundational step in developing targeted, culturally-relevant interventions to improve or minimize NCI, and thus reduce health disparities in this subpopulation. Among the many potential predictors of NCI, we focus on a set of potentially modifiable health behaviors that are particularly problematic among Hispanics, namely use of health services and personal practices associated with a healthy lifestyle (i.e., diet, and physical and cognitive activity). We also aim o examine some of the biomedical factors that might mediate the association of these health behaviors with NCI, including HIV disease burden and metabolic syndrome. Recognizing that Hispanics are a heterogeneous group, the research component of the present proposal focuses primarily on Hispanics of Mexican origin/descent, who are the largest Hispanic subgroup in the U.S. In support of the research proposal and the candidate's long-term goals, the comprehensive proposed training program builds on the applicant's background in clinical neuropsychology, as well as clinical research on cognitive aging and the neuropsychology of HIV, to gain key neuroAIDS knowledge (i.e. neuroAIDS disparities, and the intersection of HIV and aging), clinical research skills of particular relevance for cross-cultural studies (i.e. biostatistics, bioethics, and community engagement), as well as leadership and scientific communication skills. The multidisciplinary mentoring team includes expertise in all aspects of this proposal including neuroAIDS disparities (Primary Mentor: Dr. Robert Heaton; Co-mentor: Mara Luisa Zuniga; Consultant: Mariana Cherner; Collaborator: Dr. Mario de la Rosa); the intersection of aging and HIV (Co-Mentor: Dr. Dilip Jeste) including neuromedical implications (Consultant: Dr. Ronald Ellis); and cross-cultural psychometrics and biostatistics (Dr. Heaton and Consultants: Drs. Dan Mungas and Florin Vaida), bioethics (Dr. Zuniga), and community engagement (Dr. Zuniga). The present proposal will capitalize primarily on the University of California San Diego infrastructure, including the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program, the Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, the Division of Global Public Health, and the Clinical and Translational Research Institute. It will also leverage expertise at the Universit of California Davis, and Florida International University. The excellent mentoring team and robust infrastructure will provide critical support to the applicant to successfully complete her training goals. This key training and new experience in executing the proposed research plan, along with her past clinical and research experiences and her Hispanic background will place her in a unique position to conduct highly impactful research that will serve the needs of a growing, underserved and vulnerable segment of the U.S. population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) aims to investigate differences between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites in neurocognitive impairment (i.e., problems with attention, learning and memory, and other cognitive skills) associated with HIV and aging. This is an important public health priority because 1) neurocognitive problems in HIV are debilitating and especially prevalent as the number of HIV-infected persons reaching older age grows; and 2) Hispanics have higher rates of HIV-infection and worse HIV disease than non-Hispanic Whites, are the fastest growing ethnic group among older adults in the U.S., and have higher risk for neurocognitive problems both in HIV and in older age. Knowledge of the psychosocial and biomedical factors related to Hispanic ethnicity that increase risk for neurocognitive impairment associated with HIV and aging can help develop targeted, culturally relevant interventions to prevent and/or decrease neurocognitive impairment in this group and reduce health disparities.",Risk and mechanisms of neurocognitive impairment in older HIV-infected

"Racial Differences in Decision Making among Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Decision making in financial and health matters is of critical importance for maintaining independence and wellbeing in old age, and recent work in predominately older White adults suggests decision making worsens with age. While there is a paucity of knowledge regarding decision making in older Black adults, preliminary studies suggest there may be differences in decision making by race. Decision making can be viewed as a complex interaction of externally influenced contextual factors with two internal systems: a cognitive processing system and an affective processing system. Although racial differences in cognitive processing have been well documented, little is known about racial differences in other components of decision making, and these could have profound economic and public health consequences for a diverse range of older adults. The overall goal of this study is to elucidate racial differences in decision making among older adults and to identify the contextual factors, affective factors, and neurobiological mechanisms that drive them. Contextual factors, such as acquired financial and health literacy, socioeconomic status (SES), and perceived discrimination, vary by race, are often influenced by adverse social and environmental experiences over the life course, and could have important mediating effects between race and decision making. Life course experiences also shape internally modulated affective processes. Since differences in decision making are observed when affective processes interact with cognitive processes, affective factors such as trust, risk aversion, and loneliness could have important moderating effects on decision making by race. Both contextual and affective factors have recently been shown to impact the functional architecture of brain networks, revealing important insights into the neural systems involved in decision making. Regrettably, these findings have been almost exclusively in White persons; thus there is a dearth of knowledge regarding the neural correlates of decision making in Black persons. Racial differences in contextual and affective factors experienced over the life course may result in variability in the organization of functional brain systems. However, it is unknown how or whether any putative differences in functional neural network architecture may drive racial differences in decision making. Finally, Black adults are at greater risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our recent work has implicated poor decision making as a potential risk factor for AD in White adults; however, it is unknown whether and to what extent poor decision making is a risk for AD in Black adults. The proposed study will leverage existing clinical data from nondemented older Blacks and Whites participating in the Minority Aging Research Study (RF1AG022018), the Rush Clinical Core (P3010161), and an ongoing study of decision making in aging (R01AG033678) to collect new behavioral decision making and neuroimaging data among older Black adults.

"End-of-Life in Assisted Living: Links between Structure, Process, and Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the demographic imperative of a rapidly aging population, a major challenge of the 21st century will be the growing prevalence of older adults who die from old age, most within the context of advanced chronic illness. Increasing numbers of these older adults will receive care and die in assisted living (AL), currently the fastest growing long-term care (LTC) option. The proposed five-year prospective qualitative study will investigate end-of-life (EOL) care in AL from the perspective of multiple stakeholders (residents, AL staff, informal caregivers, and external care providers, e.g., hospice workers). We will use a multifaceted multilevel conceptual framework and draw upon salient aspects of social ecological theory, Donabedian's structure- process-outcome (SPO) quality-of-care paradigm, relational theory, as well as domains of quality adapted from The National Consensus Project (NCP) Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care. The overall goal of the proposed research is to address critical knowledge gaps and identify best practices for EOL care in AL. The three specific aims are: (1) understand how EOL is defined and experienced by AL residents and other key stakeholders; (2) investigate the structure and process of formal and informal care in AL and understand the interface between these care components and how they shape outcomes; and (3) identify the contexts and conditions within which structures and processes of care are shaped and understand the combined impact these aspects of care have on stakeholders' overall EOL experience. Increasingly, LTC scholars and policy-makers are calling for a broader definition of EOL that encompasses different EOL transitions, including dying as a phase of advanced chronic illness that may extend for years, as well as dying at the end of old age. In order to provide adequate support services and timely palliative care, it is important to acknowledge and identify these varying and often ambiguous EOL trajectories. Following the Institute of Medicine, we define the EOL experience broadly to include periods of decline associated with advanced age or chronic illness where the timing of death is uncertain. To investigate the EOL process as it unfolds over time, we will use grounded theory methods to study eight diverse AL settings in Georgia that vary according to size (6-15 beds; 16-24 beds; 25-50 beds; and 51+ beds), resident and staff profile, rural/urban location, ownership, licensing status, and resources. The study will include low-income, rural, and racial/ethnic minority residents, groups typically excluded from AL research, as well as residents living in dementia units. Data collection in each home will extend over two years and include: 271 in-depth interviews, informal interviewing, review of focal residents' social and health records, and participant observation. The proposed study will identify modifiable factors associated with adverse EOL experiences and potential disparities in care that can be targets of intervention at multiple ecological levels and contribute to ongoing efforts to transform and improve the quality of EOL care for older adults in LTC and other care settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed five-year prospective qualitative study investigates end-of- life (EOL) care in Georgia assisted living (AL) facilities. Such research is crucial given the growing use of AL, the increasing frailty and diversity of the AL population, and the rising number of deaths reported in AL each year. This study, which is the first to date to focus on EOL care in AL in depth, will offer valuable insights to researchers, policy-makers, and service providers.","End-of-Life in Assisted Living: Links between Structure, Process, and Outcomes",9521838,R01AG047408,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Beds ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Life Experience ', ' Living Wills ', ' living will ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Methods ', ' Ownership ', ' Palliative Care ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Societies ', ' Terminally Ill ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Licensing ', ' Shapes ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' frailty ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Location ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' health record ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' end of life care ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' theories ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Process ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative environment ', ' informal care ', ' Informal care giver ', ' informal caregiver ', ' Formal care giver ', ' Formal caregiver ', ' dementia care ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' service providers ', ' ']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,367287,0.058129670255206156
"DECISION-MAKING IN YOUNGER AND OLDER ADULTS: A DISCOUNTING FRAMEWORK Summary/Abstract Older adults often face important decisions more complicated than those usually studied in the laboratory, where choices are typically between immediate and delayed outcomes or between certain and probabilistic outcomes. In research with younger adults, such simple choices are often studied under the rubric of self-control, but recent findings suggest that rather than being a single construct, self-control may be better thought of as a collection of skills and abilities. Even fundamental decision-making processes (e.g., delay discounting or intertemporal choice; probability discounting or risky choice) may be more diverse than originally thought. With respect to age- related differences in these fundamental processes, moreover, there is a striking lack of consensus as to what changes occur as people age. We hypothesize that this picture can be greatly clarified by taking into account the presence of sex differences and income inequalities. Once the picture has been clarified, we will be well- positioned to study how fundamental decision-making processes combine in complex choice situations that are more like those that older adults, as well as younger adults, encounter every day. Therefore, Specific Aim 1 will study simple inter-temporal and risky choices involving gains and losses with the goal of understanding the structure of these fundamental decision-making abilities (e.g., the extent to which the abilities reflect a general impulsivity factor) and whether the relations among them differ in younger and older adults, thereby providing a baseline against which we then will compare the relations among abilities in more ecologically valid situations. Aim 2 will examine decision-making when choices involve outcomes that are both delayed and probabilistic, as in investments and many other financial decisions. Aim 3 focuses on decision- making when the outcomes involve both gains and losses that occur at different points in time, as in many health decisions (e.g., diets and vaccinations). Aim 4 examines choices with outcomes that differ qualitatively as well as in their time of occurrence, as when people choose between taking a vacation now or saving the money to purchase some desired good later. We plan to examine age-related differences with the goal of determining the strengths and weaknesses in older adults’ decision-making in all of the preceding ecologically valid situations. For each Aim, we will recruit participants to be tested in the laboratory using computerized tasks to assess the subjective values of potential outcomes as well as online using questionnaires previously validated in the lab. Our studies will be guided by the hypothesis that decisions involving outcomes with multiple attributes are more cognitively demanding and therefore more sensitive to age-related differences in basic cognitive abilities. These studies will also test new models of decision-making that we have developed for ecologically valid situations, models we believe will inform our analysis of age-related differences. Finally, we will examine the interaction of sex and income differences with age-related changes in decision-making, all as part of our effort to identify potential targets of interventions such as “nudges” to help older adults compensate for any specific weaknesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The need to simultaneously evaluate delayed and probabilistic costs and benefits is a critical part of the daily life of older adults. However, people often make bad decisions when delayed and probabilistic outcomes are involved, with substance abuse and gambling representing extreme, but not unusual, examples, even in older adults. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of older adults’ decision-making, the goal of the proposed research, will help in finding potential targets for interventions (e.g., ‘nudges’) designed to help older adults compensate for any specific weaknesses that we identify.",DECISION-MAKING IN YOUNGER AND OLDER ADULTS: A DISCOUNTING FRAMEWORK,9497977,R01AG058885,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Gambling ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Persons ', ' Probability ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Savings ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Woman ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Inequality ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Self-control as a personality trait ', ' self control ', ' age difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Low income ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' discount ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' discounting ', ' cognitive ability ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,342100,0.15151494852616026
"The Epidemiology of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in Sexual and Gender Minority Older Adults: Identifying Risk and Protective Factors Abstract By 2030, there will be nearly six million sexual and gender minority (SGM) older adults aged 60 and older in the U.S. who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. Approximately 350,000 SGM older adults in the U.S. currently have Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), with projections nearing one million by 2030. Yet, almost nothing is known about the prevalence or risk of ADRD in SGM older adults without HIV/AIDS. This proposal will focus on the epidemiology and risk of ADRD in SGM older adults. The first aim of this proposal is to characterize the epidemiology and risk of ADRD in a population-based sample of SGM older adults and compare the prevalence and incidence of ADRD in SGM older adults to their heterosexual peers. The second aim will focus on identifying risk and protective factors for ADRD in SGM older adults, and to estimate the population attributable risk of depression and socioeconomic status (e.g., income and education) on ADRD. The third aim will involve primary data collection in a community-based sample of SGM older adults in order to investigate the relationship between risk and protective factors and cognition, including memory and executive function. This proposal incorporates several innovations that will allow me to evaluate the epidemiology and risk of cognitive impairment and ADRD in SGM older adults: 1) this will be the first study of the epidemiology and associated risk and protective factors for cognitive impairment and ADRD in SGM older adults; 2) it leverages the largest longitudinal dataset in the nation, Research Program for Genes Environment and Health (RPGEH), with data on the physical and psychosocial health of SGM older adults; and 3) it involves a novel investigation of factors that may be associated with memory and executive function impairment in SGM older adults. To successfully complete this research, I propose three training aims: 1) advanced statistical modeling of ADRD risk and protective factors; 2) epidemiology of SGM aging and health disparities; and 3) measurement and analysis of cognitive aging. This career development award ultimately will result in the submission of a R01 to develop a future multi-site epidemiological study of cognitive aging and ADRD in SGM older adults. Given that nothing is currently known about ADRD risk in this population, this work is necessary to promote early detection; to develop culturally relevant screenings and targeted preventative interventions to decrease ADRD risk in SGM older adults; and to improve the care and quality of life of this vulnerable and understudied population. Project Narrative Almost nothing is known about the epidemiology or risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in sexual and gender minority older adults (individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) without HIV/AIDS. Sexual and gender minority older adults experience greater health disparities than their heterosexual peers, including higher rates of depression, hypertension, and other risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia. This proposal will focus on describing the epidemiology and risk and protective factors for cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in two studies with sexual and gender

"Mentoring Researchers in Advance Care Planning and Communication for Vulnerable Older Populations ABSTRACT The aims of this proposal are to (1) enable the candidate to further develop her research program focused on improving advance care planning (ACP) and informed medical decision making for vulnerable older adults and (2) use her research program as a platform for mentoring junior investigators interested in patient-oriented aging research, both within Geriatrics and other medical subspecialties. The candidate is a Geriatrician and Palliative Medicine physician who has established a high-impact independent clinical research program that is well funded with an outstanding publication record. In the 10 years since completing her Geriatrics fellowship, she has established herself as a successful mentor of students, fellows, and junior faculty who have published high-impact aging research, become successfully funded, and continue to participate in patient-oriented research in aging. The candidate has developed an extensive research portfolio focused on creating and testing literacy- and culturally appropriate health education materials to improve ACP and medical decision making for older adults. She developed a broader paradigm of ACP that focuses not only on one-time treatment decisions, such as for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but also on the process of preparing patients to communicate their wishes and to participate with clinicians in making real-time, complex medical decisions over the course of illness. She operationalized this paradigm into an easy-to-understand, patient- centered website called PREPARE that teaches patients, through videos, how to identify their wishes and communicate with surrogates and clinicians. The candidate received R01 funding from the NIA to test the efficacy of the PREPARE website to engage diverse, vulnerable older adults from an urban, county hospital in ACP using validated patient questionnaires. This K24 proposal will provide the candidate with protected time to expand her research in a new direction focused on direct observation (i.e., audio recording) of patient-clinician communication within primary care encounters in response to the PREPARE intervention. This new research will determine whether a patient-centered ACP website can empower and activate patients to discuss ACP and to facilitate communication with their primary care providers. The candidate will also develop her formal mentoring program with plans for the recruitment, selection, development, and evaluation of mentees who will become leaders in aging research. She will work with each mentee to establish a focused career development plan in which they complete research projects and develop the skills needed to become independent investigators. These plans will make full use of the outstanding clinical research training environment at UCSF. She will leverage her leadership positions at UCSF to recruit more mentees interested in research on ACP and aging in vulnerable populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will have unique public health importance because (1) it will increase mentoring of new clinical investigators interested in conducting patient-oriented research to improve advance care planning and patient- clinician communication for the rapidly growing elderly population, and (2) it will inform interventions to improve patient-clinician communication in the primary care setting, reduce health disparities in ACP, and result in diverse, older adults who are prepared for complex medical decision making.  ",Mentoring Researchers in Advance Care Planning and Communication for Vulnerable Older Populations,9429026,K24AG054415,"['Adoption ', ' Advance Directives ', ' advanced directive ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ', ' heart resuscitation ', ' cardiac resuscitation ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Medical Education ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' County Hospitals ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Leadership ', ' literacy ', ' Mentors ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Palliative Medicine ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' empowerment ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Older Population ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' clinical care ', ' primary care setting ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' student-led learning ', ' student mentoring ', ' disenfranchised group ', ' disenfranchised population ', ' recruit ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2018,187880,0.027643986098015265
"Understanding physical function in older African immigrants: the roles of acculturation and racial discrimination Abstract Physical function is an important public health concern in older African immigrants because poor physical function leads to worse health outcomes, affects quality of life and is costly to the health system. Physical function difficulties are prevalent in older adults; 33-40% of community dwelling older adults report at least one difficulty. African immigrants are one of the fastest growing immigrant groups and nearly 20% of them are older than 55 years. To prevent future disability and improve quality of life for this population, there is a need to understand the experience of physical function difficulty in older African immigrants. Acculturation and racial discrimination are associated with poorer physical function in other racial/ethnic immigrant groups and native born Blacks. Older African immigrants experience acculturation and high rates of racial discrimination; however, it is not known if these affect physical function in African immigrants. Guided by Berry’s acculturation theory and the Disablement process model, the purpose of the proposed study is to understand older African immigrants’ experiences of living with physical function difficulties; in particular the roles of acculturation and racial discrimination. A mixed methods design will be used to get an in-depth understanding of these concepts and relationships in this population. Older African immigrants (≥55years) will be recruited through community based organizations that serve African immigrants in the Baltimore- Washington Metropolitan area. We will utilize the 20 item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function (PROMIS-PF20) to assess participants’ difficulties in performing daily tasks such as bending, carrying groceries and bathing. Use of the PROMIS PF20 measure in this population will enable us to compare participants’ physical function results to the general population, since scores using this scale are normed the general population. The specific aims of this study are 1) Examine the relationship between acculturation and physical function difficulties in older African immigrants. 2) Determine the relationship between racial discrimination and physical function difficulties in older African immigrants. 3) Describe the physical function of older African immigrants and explore whether acculturation and racial discrimination affect physical function difficulties. This study aligns with the National Institute on Aging’s objective to understand the differences and health inequities experienced by older minority populations. Findings from this study can contribute to the development of culturally tailored interventions to decrease physical function difficulties in older African immigrants, towards the goal of decreasing inequities in the burden of physical function difficulties in foreign born Blacks. Project Narrative An increasing number of older Africans are migrating to the United States and the physical function of this population is not well understood. The proposed study will contribute to the understanding of factors associated with physical function difficulties in older African immigrants. Knowledge gained from this study will inform the development of strategies to improve physical function and health outcomes in older African immigrants.",Understanding physical function in older African immigrants: the roles of acculturation and racial discrimination,9401212,F31AG057166,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Baltimore ', ' Berry ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Immigration ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' United States ', ' Washington ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Native-Born ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Walking ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' African ', ' Measurement ', ' Immigrant ', ' Inflammatory ', ' cooking ', ' Knowledge ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Physical Function ', ' experience ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' stressor ', ' metropolitan ', ' Proxy ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Health system ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,0.07573856477363262
"A Contextual Approach to Understanding Operative Volume and Mortality Project Summary/Abstract Elderly patients currently comprise the majority of individuals undergoing inpatient surgery. Despite >90% of older adults living with one or more chronic health conditions, surgical intervention has become routine, as medical advancements have reduced peri-operative risk. While it has been a ground-breaking achievement to modify peri-operative risk at the individual level, it is equally important to do so at the systems level. This proposal will determine how surgeon volume (i.e., frequency of a given operation performed by a surgeon) and hospital volume (i.e., frequency of a given operation performed at a hospital) impact post-operative mortality of older adults. The findings will potentially have far-reaching implications for policymakers, hospitals, and patients, all of which seek for surgery to be performed under the safest possible circumstances.  Previous work from nearly two decades ago studied the impact of hospital operative volume on mortality; other studies from the same era evaluated the association between surgeon operative volume and mortality. However, prior research was decontextualized in that it did not address the interrelatedness of surgeons and hospitals. As such, key questions remain unanswered. For example, to be credentialed, should surgeons at lower volume hospitals be required to exceed the same minimum volume standards as their counterparts at higher volume hospitals? In summary, is hospital volume only a sum of its affiliated surgeons’ volumes – or is there a protective spillover effect associated with a high-volume hospital context?  This project will overcome the previous critical barriers and fill these knowledge gaps in two steps: (1) contextualizing the effect of surgeon and hospital volume on mortality after major vascular surgery by using contemporary multilevel techniques and (2) generalizing this approach to predict post-operative mortality by hospital and surgeon volumes for 11 major operations among older adults enrolled in Medicare. Ways in which differences in case-volume may perpetuate racial/ethnic and geographic disparities will additionally be examined.  Preliminary results expand the existing research framework, wherein surgeons and hospitals have been treated as isolated “silos.” Rather, a more complex, contextualized relationship is suggested in which hospital volume has a protective (“buffering”) effect on post-operative mortality, even with lower volume surgeons. In accordance with the National Institute on Aging’s goal of “modifying organizational…behaviors in order to improve important health outcomes among members of population groups at older ages,” the results of these studies will inform optimal hospital and surgeon selection among older adults undergoing major operations. Under the close mentorship of faculty experts at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the PI will gain expertise with advanced epidemiologic methods, a deep understanding of the analysis of Medicare data, and the preparation necessary to become a K-funded surgeon-scientist in the future. Project Narrative As Americans age amid a wealth of medical advancements, more individuals living with age-related chronic health conditions undergo complex surgical operations which simultaneously hold the potential for life-salvation (or quality-of-life improvement) and, more rarely, the risk of mortality or serious complication. Using a contextual, multilevel approach, we propose to study the concurrent effect of hospital volume and surgeon volume on post-operative mortality among older adults. In accordance with the National Institute on Aging’s mission to “understand and address the…health service implications of the United States’ changing demographics” in order to “reduce the burden of illness, enhance quality of life, and maintain health among older adults,” the results from this project will inform patients about the impact of the experience of their surgeons and hospitals and will hold ramifications for hospital regionalization and surgeon credentialing.",A Contextual Approach to Understanding Operative Volume and Mortality,9832256,F32AG064831,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Buffers ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Complication ', ' Credentialing ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Pancreas ', ' pancreatic neoplasia ', ' Pancreatic Tumor ', ' Pancreas Tumor ', ' Pancreas Neoplasms ', ' pancreatic neoplasm ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Health Care Quality Indicators ', ' Healthcare Quality Indicators ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' patient safety ', ' Provider ', ' Population Group ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Perioperative ', ' Preparation ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' operation ', ' family support ', ' inpatient surgery ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F32,2019,57307,0.03822185158016336
"Risk Factors for Social Isolation Among African American Older Adults R36 Dissertation Proposal Abstract: Risk Factors for Social Isolation among African American Older Adults BACKGROUND: Social isolation is a significant public health issue among older adults in the United States. It is related to a host of negative health outcomes including mortality, worse self- rated physical health, higher depressive symptoms, worse sleep quality, and cognitive decline. Factors associated with social isolation among older adults include living alone, experiencing a significant life change, living in a rural community, belonging to a cultural minority group, having low income, and having severe physical and/or mental disabilities. To the investigator’s knowledge, there are few studies which examine social isolation among African American older adults, few studies that examine risk factors for social isolation among African American older adults, and one study that distinguishes between objective and subjective isolation among older African Americans. The aims of the proposed study are: 1) to determine the risk factors associated with objective and subjective social isolation among older African Americans; and 2) to determine if risk factors associated with objective and subjective social isolation among older African Americans vary by age, gender, and living in a rural or urban environment. The theoretical model which influenced the development of the proposed study is the Convoy Model of Social Relations. The investigator hypothesizes that increases in objective isolation and subjective isolation will be associated with several risk factors, including lower education, lower income, worse self-rated health, increasing neighborhood physical disorder, and decreasing neighborhood social cohesion. Additionally, the investigator hypotheses that risk factors for social isolation among African American older adults vary by age, gender, and living in a rural or urban environment. METHODS: The aims of the proposed study will be addressed using the Health and Retirement Study, Leave Behind Questionnaire dataset, 2008 and 2012 waves. Objective isolation will be operationalized using the social network index, and subjective isolation will be operationalized using the Hughes and colleagues 3 item loneliness scale. Descriptive statistics, T-Tests, ANOVAs, and multivariate regression analyses using lagged variables will be calculated. In general, social isolation at 2012 is regressed on social isolation and all risk factors in 2008. Additionally, interaction terms, testing the moderating effects of age, gender, and living in a rural or urban environment, will be used to address the study aims. Knowledge generated from the proposed study will be useful for designing ethnically tailored social isolation risk assessments, tailored isolation reducing interventions, and for policy and program development to decrease isolation among all older adults. This proposal is responsive to PAR-17-025 Aging Research Dissertation Awards to Increase Diversity. R36 Proposal Project Narrative: Risk Factors for Social Isolation among African American Older Adults Social isolation is associated with many negative health outcomes among older adults, and there are few studies which have examined differences in risk factors for social isolation among older African Americans. Older African Americans have a projected population growth of 99% between now and 2030, have an increased risk for becoming socially isolated, and are less likely to utilize health services in comparison to older Whites. Knowledge gained from the proposed study will be useful for creating ethnically tailored social isolation risk assessments, tailored isolation reducing interventions, and policy and program development to decrease isolation among African American older adults.",Risk Factors for Social Isolation Among African American Older Adults,9625071,R36AG054647,"['Academy ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Analysis of Variance ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' ANOVA ', ' Award ', ' life change ', ' Climacteric ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Household ', ' indexing ', ' Institutes ', ' Life Experience ', ' Literature ', ' lonely ', ' Loneliness ', ' Marital Status ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Population Growth ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' World Health ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Rural Community ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' disability ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Respondent ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Consequentialism ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Sum ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' social engagement ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' rural environment ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R36,2019,48291,0.19143676093789935
"Older adults in vulnerable communities: Health and quality of life over time The dramatically escalating number and diversity of older adults are defining features of the world-wide population. Research demonstrates that older adults from marginalized and disadvantaged populations are at elevated risk of accelerated aging and premature death. The National Institutes of Health are committed to reducing and eliminating health disparities and have recognized that health disparities among sexual and gender minority people are one of the main gaps in health research. Recent population-based studies have demonstrated that sexual and gender minority older adults are at elevated risks of chronic health conditions, disability, and poor physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The proposed longitudinal research will follow more than 2,300 demographically diverse LGBT adults aged 50 or older recruited from all U.S. Census divisions. Based on an innovative health equity promotion framework incorporating a life course development perspective, this study will examine the risk and protective factors affecting the health and well- being of LGBT older adults over time. This multidisciplinary national research team, in collaboration with community-based partner agencies, addresses a critical gap by identifying modifiable mechanisms impacting health and HRQOL over time. Utilizing 8 years of longitudinal survey data and objective data (biomarkers and physical and cognitive measures) and linking with administrative data from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the primary aims of the project are: 1) Identify at-risk LGBT older adults by investigating trajectories of health outcomes over time, their relationships with stigma, and the mediating roles of stress; 2) Understand modifiable mechanisms accounting for variability in changes in health outcomes by examining the roles of identity management, social networks, physical activity, and barriers to health care as well as health service utilization; and 3) Examine disparities in multimorbidity, disability, and HRQOL by demographic factors (age cohort, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity) and risk and protective factors that account for health disparities. This study also harmonizes with external population-based data including Health and Retirement Study, National Health Interview Survey, and American Community Survey to enhance the study and ensure cost efficiency. As the older adult population increases, the health care costs associated with health disparities will continue to rise. To respond to this growing public health challenge it is imperative to identify groups at high risk of disparities and to determine the modifiable mechanisms impacting their health and well-being as they age. The findings from this research will generate much needed information to directly inform and guide the development of tailored interventions that can be effectively delivered within community- based agency settings to improve the health and quality of life of demographically diverse older adults. As health care costs associated with health disparities among the fast growing older adult population continues to rise, it is imperative to identify groups at risk of disparities and to determine the modifiable factors impacting their health and quality of life. Sexual and gender minority older adults have been identified as an at-risk, under-investigated and under-served health disparate population. This longitudinal research will identify risk and protective mechanisms impacting the health and quality of life of LGBT older adults, which will directly contribute to the development of tailored interventions to improve the health of demographically diverse older adults and subsequently reduce health care costs.",Older adults in vulnerable communities: Health and quality of life over

"Racial Differences in Decision Making among Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Decision making in financial and health matters is of critical importance for maintaining independence and wellbeing in old age, and recent work in predominately older White adults suggests decision making worsens with age. While there is a paucity of knowledge regarding decision making in older Black adults, preliminary studies suggest there may be differences in decision making by race. Decision making can be viewed as a complex interaction of externally influenced contextual factors with two internal systems: a cognitive processing system and an affective processing system. Although racial differences in cognitive processing have been well documented, little is known about racial differences in other components of decision making, and these could have profound economic and public health consequences for a diverse range of older adults. The overall goal of this study is to elucidate racial differences in decision making among older adults and to identify the contextual factors, affective factors, and neurobiological mechanisms that drive them. Contextual factors, such as acquired financial and health literacy, socioeconomic status (SES), and perceived discrimination, vary by race, are often influenced by adverse social and environmental experiences over the life course, and could have important mediating effects between race and decision making. Life course experiences also shape internally modulated affective processes. Since differences in decision making are observed when affective processes interact with cognitive processes, affective factors such as trust, risk aversion, and loneliness could have important moderating effects on decision making by race. Both contextual and affective factors have recently been shown to impact the functional architecture of brain networks, revealing important insights into the neural systems involved in decision making. Regrettably, these findings have been almost exclusively in White persons; thus there is a dearth of knowledge regarding the neural correlates of decision making in Black persons. Racial differences in contextual and affective factors experienced over the life course may result in variability in the organization of functional brain systems. However, it is unknown how or whether any putative differences in functional neural network architecture may drive racial differences in decision making. Finally, Black adults are at greater risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our recent work has implicated poor decision making as a potential risk factor for AD in White adults; however, it is unknown whether and to what extent poor decision making is a risk for AD in Black adults. The proposed study will leverage existing clinical data from nondemented older Blacks and Whites participating in the Minority Aging Research Study (RF1AG022018), the Rush Clinical Core (P3010161), and an ongoing study of decision making in aging (R01AG033678) to collect new behavioral decision making and neuroimaging data among older Black adults. Knowledge of racial differences in decision making and the associated factors that drive them will provide crucial information for identifying potentially modifiable targets for intervention to address health disparities.

"Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research Overall Abstract The Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR), a mature social and behavioral science center of the Resource Center for Minority Aging Research program, proposes to expand its reach and impact by mentoring junior faculty (most of whom will be African American) and by focusing on African American Life-course health research. Michigan State University (MSU) will formally join the University of Michigan (UM) and Wayne State University (WSU) to form the new MCUAAAR. Our three specific aims include: 1) Increase reach and coverage by including Michigan State University as a full partner in the MCUAAAR; 2) Recruit and mentor 15 new junior researchers; and, 3) Increase important research on the life-course experiences of older adults of diverse ethnic and racial populations, especially African Americans. Four cores are proposed in this application; Administrative, Analytic, REC and CLRC. We will employ an integrative approach to mentoring, entailing a structured set of activities and training across the pilot funding period: (a) Formal goals will be set at the beginning of the pilot and reviewed in monthly MCUAAAR meetings; (b) Based on the goals set, a mentoring team will be assembled to assist with research, dissemination of findings, and research translation; (c) A set of training activities in scientific writing, measurement, and community-based research partnerships will be conducted each year; (d) A formal six-month evaluation will be conducted and shared with the MCUAAAR faculty; and, (e) During the second year, an ongoing MCUAAAR mentor will be assigned to assist with publications and grant preparation and provide support to junior researchers attending conferences. There will also be opportunities for longer-term mentoring and training in the program. We continue to be motivated by an NIH-funded series of studies (e.g., Ginther et al., 2011) in which applications from black scientists were shown to be 10 percentage points less likely to obtain grant awards than applications from white investigators; in practical terms, this gap means that white applicants are about twice as likely as blacks to be approved and funded. The RCMAR program has been important in helping to eliminate this gap for RCMAR researchers overall, and we continue to focus on the importance of abolishing the disparity for African American researchers in particular. We are also motivated by the continuing disparities in chronic disease and mortality among older African Americans.

"The Burden of Care for Adults with Dementia: Impact on Care Quality and Family Outcomes Project Abstract: Care for older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) during the final years of life is extremely costly and families carry a high share of this burden. Costs and shifting patterns of year-over-year spending are likely associated with adverse care quality and family financial outcomes, yet to date individual- level, comprehensive, longitudinal data on spending and its effect on outcomes have not been examined. Existing data also demonstrate that those vulnerable subgroups least able to cope are at greatest financial risk, which may result in further disparities in outcomes. Therefore, this project aims to understand the magnitude of this healthcare spending and its distribution across payers and families over time and how this spending contributes to disparities in care quality and family outcomes among older adults with dementia, particularly among vulnerable and underserved populations. The study will assemble data that capture total healthcare spending and proportion by payer (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, individuals, families, and others), using the nationally-representative Health and Retirement Study and linked Medicare and Medicaid claims data. Specifically, the project will 1) Compare yearly patterns of total health-related costs and proportion of costs paid by Medicare, Medicaid, out-of-pocket, informal caregiving, and other payers, in each of the last 5 years of life among older adults with or without ADRD and across vulnerable subgroups; 2) Test if out-of-pocket costs exceeding household wealth are associated with indicators of care quality (nursing home admission for long- term care, ≥3 transitions across care sites in the last 90 days of life, suboptimal hospice use, i.e. enrollment >6 months or <3 days, and in-hospital death) among older adults with or without ADRD and across vulnerable subgroups; and 3) Examine if out-of-pocket costs exceeding household wealth are associated with potentially adverse intergenerational family financial outcomes (cohabitation, caregiving and financial support by adult children) among older adults with or without ADRD and across vulnerable subgroups. The results will directly inform health and social policy, and help to ensure high quality care for older adults with ADRD, while avoiding impoverishment of families and compounding of racial and socioeconomic disparities. Project Narrative: This project seeks to better understand the burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias on individuals, their families, and society and particularly those belonging to vulnerable social and demographic subgroups. We will examine individuals' health-related costs across all payers (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, individuals, families, and others), year-over-year, among older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, compared to those without dementia, and assess how spending influences both care quality and family outcomes. The results of this study will inform effective health and social policies that will ensure high quality care for elders with dementias and better distribute public and private healthcare resources.",The Burden of Care for Adults with Dementia: Impact on Care Quality and Family Outcomes,9717178,R01AG054540,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' cost shifting ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Family ', ' financial assistance ', ' Financial Support ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Hospices ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Persons ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Privatization ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Policies ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Unmarried ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' exhaust ', ' Site ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' exhaustion ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' intergenerational ', ' high school ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Adult Children ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' longterm care for elderly ', ' elder care ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' care burden ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' financial incentive ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' informal care ', ' informal caregiving ', ' Informal care giving ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' social vulnerability ', ' ']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,423750,0.030742853886729215
"Educational Attainment, Geography, and U.S. Adult Mortality Risk PROJECT SUMMARY Educational attainment is one of the strongest social determinants of U.S. adult mortality risk. Studies to explain the education-mortality association have focused more on the individual-level “proximal” mechanisms (e.g., smoking) than identifying the contextual conditions that undergird the association. This major knowledge gap has consequences for science and public policy; it limits the discovery of explanations and interventions. The gap may reflect the dominant view in U.S. research that education is a personal resource. Accordingly, U.S. studies of the education-mortality association have emphasized agentic mechanisms: individuals with more education are thought to coalesce healthy lifestyles, seek out medical knowledge, avoid financial hardship, and so on. While agentic explanations are important, they ignore the fact that individuals are embedded in social and political contexts that influence the extent to which education matters for mortality. Despite numerous studies showing this to be the case in Europe, there has been scant research in the U.S. The goal of this study is to examine how and why the education-mortality association varies across U.S. states. Decisions made by governors and state legislatures affect employment, housing, transportation, social integration, healthy lifestyles, and numerous other social determinants of mortality. These state contexts have grown increasingly disparate through decades of deregulation and devolution. These trends may explain why, by the end of the 20th century, the range in life expectancy at age 50 across U.S. states exceeded the range across comparable high-income countries, and ½ of the variation in life expectancy across U.S. counties was attributable to the state within which they are located. This study addresses three questions: (1) How does the education-mortality association vary across states and over time?, (2) How does the variation in the education- mortality association across states and over time reflect state policies, resources, and opportunity structures?, and (3) What are the individual pathways through which state policies, resources, and opportunity structures shape the education-mortality association? The central hypothesis is that the association differs markedly across states, and that it is weakest in states with progressive economic policies, robust employment opportunities, and high social cohesion. The study will use data on adults aged 45-89 years in the restricted 1985-2011 National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality File. Using discrete-time survival models, it will examine all-cause and cause-specific mortality. All analyses will be stratified by gender, age group, and time period. Analyses account for interstate migration and county-level mortality variation to better isolate the importance of state contexts. Expected outcomes of this study include: (a) estimates of the education-mortality association by state, and (b) insights into policies and strategies that states might employ to reduce mortality among their populations. The long-term goal is to reduce adult mortality, especially among vulnerable groups. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will: (a) contribute to fundamental knowledge about how and why the magnitude of socioeconomic inequalities in adult mortality differ across U.S. states, and (b) identify policies and strategies that states might implement to reduce these inequalities and improve older adult longevity. The proposed research is relevant to several priorities of NIA, including its priority to reduce health disparities and eliminate health inequities among older adults.","Educational Attainment, Geography, and U.S. Adult Mortality Risk",9696717,R01AG055481,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decentralization ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Europe ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Medicaid ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Politics ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Salaries ', ' Wages ', ' Sales ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Taxation ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Transportation ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Mortality Determinants ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Economic Policy ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Outcome Study ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' social integration ', ' cohesion ', ' authority ', ' Cigarette ', ' Structure ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Science Policy ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' tobacco control ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' migration ', ' effective intervention ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' healthy life-style ', ' local economy ', ' discrete time ', ' education research ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NIA,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,279070,0.06119802754802445
"Activity Space, Social Interaction and Health Trajectories in Later Life ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central goal of this research program is to describe the social and spatial environments in which older adults spend their time. We focus on the extent to which this activity space influences health trajectories. We theorize that the components of the person-environment relationship, including household, neighborhood, and network contexts, are interrelated and mutually constituted. We aim to 1) describe the activity space that older adults inhabit, and 2) explore the extent to which activity space, and the network, household, and neighborhood exposures related to it, affect short-term and pre-clinical changes in health. We will collect primary, multi-wave data from 600 Chicagoans aged 65 and older. We incorporate reports of network connectedness and activity tracking across physical space using GPS methodology. By equipping respondents with smart phones, we are able to collect real-time data on latitude, longitude and distance traveled. We use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology to obtain respondents' reports of their social settings, health status, health behaviors, and well- being. In-person interviews will obtain self-reported and objective indices of health, including body mass index and a salivary measure to assess chronic stress exposure. A particularly innovative feature of this study is the ability to capture changes n quotidian symptoms, potentially indicative of chronic disease onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tracking older adults' movements-in, out of, and across their communities-will provide insight into their span of engagement, the contexts most relevant for their health and well-being, and their access to social and community resources. These dynamic data, coupled with frequent multi-dimensional health assessments, combine to form an unprecedented opportunity to examine the mechanisms through which social context affects health across time.","Activity Space, Social Interaction and Health Trajectories in Later Life",9699993,R01AG050605,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Attention ', ' Chicago ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Household ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methodology ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Saliva ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Socialization ', ' Sociology ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Body measure procedure ', ' Body Measures ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Fostering ', ' Inequality ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Physical assessment ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Nature ', ' Empirical Research ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Salivary ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' respiratory ', ' Services ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' cohesion ', ' Structure ', ' family structure ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Consequentialism ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' social engagement ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' data resource ', ' health assessment ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL OPINION RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,599500,0.08420753494363625
"Understanding the Causes, Consequences, and Severity of Elder Mistreatment: A Longitudinal, Population-Based Study Project Summary/Abstract The current state of basic elder mistreatment (EM) science on risk factors and consequences to inform the development of effective primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention interventions is constrained by a literature with substantial methodological limitations. In particular, the field lacks longitudinal population-based research inclusive of vulnerable older adult sub-populations that provides generalizable and causally-inferred information. Further, population-based research to date has limited EM measurement to binary (no/yes) outcomes that obscure the variation in severity characterizing this issue. The goal of the proposed project is to overcome long-standing methodological limitations in the EM literature to advance more generalizable basic science on EM risk factors and consequences and to integrate severity into understanding of the problem. This study will collect a second wave of data (nine years post) from the population-based New York State Elder Mistreatment Prevalence Study (NYSEMPS). Drawing on a representative, probability Wave 1 sample, direct telephone interviews will be conducted with a follow-up sample (n = approx.1555) of older adults or close proxies, regardless of cognitive status or living setting to address the following aims: 1) identify longitudinal EM risk factors for older adults in the general population, 2) describe how EM severity changes over time among victims and identify factors predicting changes in severity, 3) identify longitudinal EM health consequences, and 4) understand the relationship between EM severity and adverse health consequences. The proposed study adheres to accepted conceptual boundaries that define EM as a distinct form of victimization and is informed by a longitudinal stress process conceptual framework. The methodological advancements underlying the proposed study have the capacity to generate the most valid, reliable, and generalizable information on EM risk factors, consequences, and severity to date. Findings from this study will directly inform targeted primary, secondary, and tertiary EM prevention interventions. Project Narrative Elder mistreatment is a pervasive problem affecting a growing older adult population that carries serious consequences, including mortality and physical/mental health morbidities. The proposed research will generate generalizable knowledge on elder mistreatment risk factors, consequences, and severity to inform targeted public health, social service, and medical interventions designed to prevent, respond to, and treat victimization.","Understanding the Causes, Consequences, and Severity of Elder Mistreatment: A Longitudinal, Population-Based Study",9983277,R01AG060080,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Communities ', ' conceptual processes ', ' Concept Formation ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' senior abuse ', ' elderly abuse ', ' elder mistreatment ', ' elder maltreatment ', ' abuse of older adults ', ' Elder Abuse ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Female ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Literature ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' New York ', ' Population Growth ', ' Prevalence Study ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Probability ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Sociology ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Rural ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Physical Dependence ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' tertiary prevention ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' perpetrators ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Child Abuse and Neglect ', ' child maltreatment ', ' Childhood maltreatment ', ' Clinical Nursing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' modifiable risk ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2019,43978,0.06728876729315356
"ESRD-specific physiologic reserve: Improving geriatric transplant prognostication - Diversity Supplement Older adults with end stage renal disease (ESRD) who receive kidney transplantation (KT) double their life expectancy. The new kidney allocation system, designed to better match longevity of recipients and allografts, has been in effect for 2 years. During this time, access to KT among older adults has plummeted; with rates declining 10% for candidates aged 61-70 and 24% for those aged >70. The core problem is that the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) decided that longevity matching for the new allocation system would be based on Estimated Post-Transplant Survival (EPTS), a simple model that only includes chronologic age, diabetes, time on dialysis, and prior transplant. EPTS has poor predictive power among older recipients; the c- statistic of EPTS for older recipients is 0.59, which is lower than the c-statistic of 0.67 for younger recipients. We hypothesize that a measure of physiologic reserve will more accurately stratify risk among older KT recipients than chronologic age. Our preliminary work suggests that the Fried frailty phenotype, is associated with poor post-KT outcomes. While our findings are encouraging, it is unlikely that this construct captures all the dimensions of physiologic reserve associated with ESRD. It is likely that some attributes of the Fried frailty phenotype are not even relevant for this population. We believe an ESRD-specific measure of physiologic reserve, beyond frailty and/or other conventional measures, would greatly improve risk stratification. UNOS and the transplant community might be reluctant to add a new variable to the purposefully parsimonious EPTS score, which was debated for 15 years. Our novel approach, supported by the upcoming UNOS president, is to replace chronologic age with physiologic age in the model. The overarching goal of our research will be to develop a physiologic age calculator and test whether replacing chronologic age with physiologic age improves prognostication for older adults with ESRD. To achieve these goals, we will leverage existing data and collect new data within an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of 5,500 ESRD patients. We will abstract new data on components of physiologic reserve from the parent study and enroll an additional 2,342 new ESRD patients in an ancillary study which will directly measure the physiologic reserve components that cannot be abstracted. We will test the following aims: 1) To elicit and evaluate novel constructs that might quantify physiologic reserve in older ESRD patients; 2) To create a valid, reliable, and generalizable measure of physiologic reserve for ESRD patients; 3) To test if replacing chronologic age with physiologic age improves prognostication in older recipients. This work would improve prognostication for older adults with ESRD, which would benefit patient selection, informed consent, and case-mix adjusted transplant center report cards. Our novel approach to replacing chronologic age with physiologic age has the support of UNOS leadership and could have an immediate impact on organ allocation and prioritization, possibly improving access for older KT candidates. Project Narrative Longevity matching for the new kidney allocation system is based on Estimated Post-Transplant Survival (EPTS), a purposefully simple model that only includes chronologic age, diabetes status, time on dialysis, and prior transplant; in this model chronologic age is used a surrogate for physiologic reserve which disadvantages older kidney transplant (KT) candidates. We will 1) develop an ESRD-specific measure of physiologic reserve and test the validity, reliability and generalizability of this novel measure, 2) calculate physiologic age based on the ESRD-specific measure of physiologic reserve, and 3) integrate physiologic age into EPTS, testing whether it improves mortality prognostication for both older KT recipients",ESRD-specific physiologic reserve: Improving geriatric transplant prognostication -

"Multimorbidity Patterns in Middle-Aged and Older Couples: Implications for Psychological Well-Being and Health Behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY  Multimorbidity is an increasingly prevalent public health concern among middle-aged and older adults. Multiple chronic conditions place a high burden on individuals and their families, leading to elevated rates of hospitalization, disability, and mortality. The spousal tie is a crucial source of health-related influence and support for aging adults with chronic illness. Yet little is known about how individuals with multimorbidity may affect and/or be affected by their spouse in ways that benefit or harm their long-term health. Moreover, few studies have considered multimorbidity in both spouses. Multiple chronic conditions may be particularly stressful when they involve management strategies that are discordant (e.g., reducing cardiovascular risk factors vs. reducing pain) within or between spouses due to heightened support needs. Discordant conditions may also strain limited personal resources and disrupt each partner's self-care routines, resulting in decreased health-promoting behaviors (e.g., physical activity) and increased health-risk behaviors (e.g., alcohol use) that ultimately diminish their health and well-being. This project will advance the literature by examining patterns of multimorbidity within mid- and late-life couples, their long-term implications for psychological well-being and health behaviors, and sociodemographic and psychosocial factors that may buffer or exacerbate these links.  The proposed project will draw on data from ten waves (1996 to 2014) of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), including both members of the spousal dyad. We will explore three specific areas of inquiry: First, we will determine patterns of multimorbidity within and between spouses, focusing on concordance in their management activities and whether patterns vary by sociodemographics. Second, we will evaluate long-term associations between couples' multimorbidity patterns and both spouses' psychological well-being (depressive symptoms) and health behaviors (sleep, physical activity, alcohol use, and smoking). Third, we will identify sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, race, and education) and psychosocial resources (control beliefs, relationship quality with one's spouse, family members, and friends) that moderate these associations.  This project will generate critical information about combinations of multiple chronic conditions that may have lasting effects on health and well-being in aging couples. Research has established that there are consistent associations between one spouse's illness and his or her partner's physical and psychological health; but prior work has placed a near exclusive emphasis on a single chronic condition in one spouse, neglecting an understanding of each partner's multiple conditions and their potential consequences for well- being and health within the marriage. Findings will inform targeted interventions to promote the long-term well- being of older individuals and families managing multiple chronic conditions as well as a more comprehensive approach to the treatment of multimorbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Multiple chronic conditions often involve discordant management activities that may be stressful for individuals and their spouses due to increased support needs, strained personal resources, and disrupted self- care routines in the marriage. Drawing on a nationally representative sample of middle-aged and older couples, this project will 1) identify patterns of multimorbidity both within and between spouses, focusing on concordance in the management activities required by multiple conditions and whether patterns vary by age, gender, race, and education; 2) investigate the long-term implications of these patterns for each partner's psychological well-being and health behaviors; and 3) evaluate sociodemographic characteristics and psychosocial resources that may buffer or exacerbate such associations. Considering multimorbidity in a dyadic context will inform targeted interventions to maintain the health and functioning of an especially vulnerable population of aging adults.",Multimorbidity Patterns in Middle-Aged and Older Couples: Implications for Psychological Well-Being and Health Behaviors,9755288,R03AG057838,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Arthritis ', ' arthritic ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Buffers ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Couples ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Literature ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Marriage ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' mortality ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Persons ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Sleep ', ' Smoking ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Family member ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Attenuated ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' member ', ' holistic approach ', ' Categories ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Consequentialism ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' neglect ', ' family management ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' aged ', ' older women ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' routine care ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' health data ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' pain reduction ', ' reduce pain ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2019,78000,0.00872693466563725
"End-of-Life in Assisted Living: Links between Structure, Process, and Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the demographic imperative of a rapidly aging population, a major challenge of the 21st century will be the growing prevalence of older adults who die from old age, most within the context of advanced chronic illness. Increasing numbers of these older adults will receive care and die in assisted living (AL), currently the fastest growing long-term care (LTC) option. The proposed five-year prospective qualitative study will investigate end-of-life (EOL) care in AL from the perspective of multiple stakeholders (residents, AL staff, informal caregivers, and external care providers, e.g., hospice workers). We will use a multifaceted multilevel conceptual framework and draw upon salient aspects of social ecological theory, Donabedian's structure- process-outcome (SPO) quality-of-care paradigm, relational theory, as well as domains of quality adapted from The National Consensus Project (NCP) Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care. The overall goal of the proposed research is to address critical knowledge gaps and identify best practices for EOL care in AL. The three specific aims are: (1) understand how EOL is defined and experienced by AL residents and other key stakeholders; (2) investigate the structure and process of formal and informal care in AL and understand the interface between these care components and how they shape outcomes; and (3) identify the contexts and conditions within which structures and processes of care are shaped and understand the combined impact these aspects of care have on stakeholders' overall EOL experience. Increasingly, LTC scholars and policy-makers are calling for a broader definition of EOL that encompasses different EOL transitions, including dying as a phase of advanced chronic illness that may extend for years, as well as dying at the end of old age. In order to provide adequate support services and timely palliative care, it is important to acknowledge and identify these varying and often ambiguous EOL trajectories. Following the Institute of Medicine, we define the EOL experience broadly to include periods of decline associated with advanced age or chronic illness where the timing of death is uncertain. To investigate the EOL process as it unfolds over time, we will use grounded theory methods to study eight diverse AL settings in Georgia that vary according to size (6-15 beds; 16-24 beds; 25-50 beds; and 51+ beds), resident and staff profile, rural/urban location, ownership, licensing status, and resources. The study will include low-income, rural, and racial/ethnic minority residents, groups typically excluded from AL research, as well as residents living in dementia units. Data collection in each home will extend over two years and include: 271 in-depth interviews, informal interviewing, review of focal residents' social and health records, and participant observation. The proposed study will identify modifiable factors associated with adverse EOL experiences and potential disparities in care that can be targets of intervention at multiple ecological levels and contribute to ongoing efforts to transform and improve the quality of EOL care for older adults in LTC and other care settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed five-year prospective qualitative study investigates end-of- life (EOL) care in Georgia assisted living (AL) facilities. Such research is crucial given the growing use of AL, the increasing frailty and diversity of the AL population, and the rising number of deaths reported in AL each year. This study, which is the first to date to focus on EOL care in AL in depth, will offer valuable insights to researchers, policy-makers, and service providers.","End-of-Life in Assisted Living: Links between Structure, Process, and Outcomes",9689393,R01AG047408,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Beds ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospices ', ' hospice environment ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' Life Experience ', ' living will ', ' Living Wills ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Methods ', ' Ownership ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Perception ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Societies ', ' Terminally Ill ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Licensing ', ' Shapes ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' frailty ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Location ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' health record ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' end of life care ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' theories ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Process ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' public health relevance ', ' professional atmosphere ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' work atmosphere ', ' job environment ', ' informal care ', ' informal caregiver ', ' Informal care giver ', ' Formal caregiver ', ' Formal care giver ', ' dementia care ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' service providers ', ' ']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,346745,0.058129670255206156
"Mentoring Researchers in Advance Care Planning and Communication for Vulnerable Older Populations ABSTRACT The aims of this proposal are to (1) enable the candidate to further develop her research program focused on improving advance care planning (ACP) and informed medical decision making for vulnerable older adults and (2) use her research program as a platform for mentoring junior investigators interested in patient-oriented aging research, both within Geriatrics and other medical subspecialties. The candidate is a Geriatrician and Palliative Medicine physician who has established a high-impact independent clinical research program that is well funded with an outstanding publication record. In the 10 years since completing her Geriatrics fellowship, she has established herself as a successful mentor of students, fellows, and junior faculty who have published high-impact aging research, become successfully funded, and continue to participate in patient-oriented research in aging. The candidate has developed an extensive research portfolio focused on creating and testing literacy- and culturally appropriate health education materials to improve ACP and medical decision making for older adults. She developed a broader paradigm of ACP that focuses not only on one-time treatment decisions, such as for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but also on the process of preparing patients to communicate their wishes and to participate with clinicians in making real-time, complex medical decisions over the course of illness. She operationalized this paradigm into an easy-to-understand, patient- centered website called PREPARE that teaches patients, through videos, how to identify their wishes and communicate with surrogates and clinicians. The candidate received R01 funding from the NIA to test the efficacy of the PREPARE website to engage diverse, vulnerable older adults from an urban, county hospital in ACP using validated patient questionnaires. This K24 proposal will provide the candidate with protected time to expand her research in a new direction focused on direct observation (i.e., audio recording) of patient-clinician communication within primary care encounters in response to the PREPARE intervention. This new research will determine whether a patient-centered ACP website can empower and activate patients to discuss ACP and to facilitate communication with their primary care providers. The candidate will also develop her formal mentoring program with plans for the recruitment, selection, development, and evaluation of mentees who will become leaders in aging research. She will work with each mentee to establish a focused career development plan in which they complete research projects and develop the skills needed to become independent investigators. These plans will make full use of the outstanding clinical research training environment at UCSF. She will leverage her leadership positions at UCSF to recruit more mentees interested in research on ACP and aging in vulnerable populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will have unique public health importance because (1) it will increase mentoring of new clinical investigators interested in conducting patient-oriented research to improve advance care planning and patient- clinician communication for the rapidly growing elderly population, and (2) it will inform interventions to improve patient-clinician communication in the primary care setting, reduce health disparities in ACP, and result in diverse, older adults who are prepared for complex medical decision making.  ",Mentoring Researchers in Advance Care Planning and Communication for Vulnerable Older Populations,9656918,K24AG054415,"['Adoption ', ' Advance Directives ', ' advanced directive ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ', ' heart resuscitation ', ' cardiac resuscitation ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Medical Education ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' County Hospitals ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Leadership ', ' literacy ', ' Mentors ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Palliative Medicine ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' empowerment ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Training ', ' Older Population ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' clinical care ', ' primary care setting ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' student mentoring ', ' student-led learning ', ' disenfranchised population ', ' disenfranchised group ', ' recruit ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2019,187880,0.027643986098015265
"Peer Empowerment Program for Physical Activity in Low Income & Minority Seniors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peer Empowerment Program for Physical Activity in Low Income & Minority Seniors Older adults are the least active population group in the US. Yet, research has shown that an increase in physical activity (PA) can have immediate and profound effects on cardiovascular health. Older adults who are active use significantly fewer health care resources, and with the increasing number of older adults in the US it is imperative to curb health care expenditure in this group. Many PA interventions are flawed because they focus on individual motivations and ignore variations in community resources, neighborhood walkability, and safety. Low income and ethnically diverse communities have disproportionately fewer resources and less supportive neighborhoods. This contributes to lower PA levels and health disparities in obesity, diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. National and international health institutions have called for community based PA programs to improve population health. Senior centers are an ideal setting for PA interventions because they serve a large number of older adults and there are funding mechanisms for delivery of evidence based programs. While there are multiple benefits of different PA programs, national guidelines for PA still emphasize aerobic activity. Senior Centers currently offer group based PA programs but our preliminary studies show that 1) low income, ethnically diverse older adults attending such centers are not meeting PA guidelines, 2) evidence based programs in such centers do not generate moderate intensity PA, 3) they do not provide behavioral strategies to support more frequent and independent PA and 4) members are not involved in the delivery of such programs which may increase engagement and sustainability. We propose to build upon our NHLBI R01 funded PA program that increased aerobic activity in retirement community residents. The program was delivered by UCSD health educators for 6 months with the help of peer leaders who then sustained it over 12 months. To improve upon this work, we propose a train the trainer model with a greater focus on empowering the peer leaders, center staff and participants to self-monitor, self-organize and advocate for additional resources from the start. Since our aim is to test a PA program that can be adopted by local area aging agencies with Older Americans Act Title IIID funds, we will employ an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design; which allows for the concurrent testing of both intervention and implementation strategies and outcomes. We will also extend program monitoring to 24 months. Thus, in a 2-year cluster randomized controlled field trial of 408 ethnically diverse, older adults (50+ years old) in 12 low income Senior Centers in San Diego County we will investigate the efficacy of PEP4PA (Peer Empowerment Program 4 Physical Activity) to reduce disparities in PA by increasing the percentage of participants achieving 150 minutes of PA per week and to improve physical functioning & fitness, blood pressure, depressive symptoms and quality of life at 6, 12 & 24 months. We will assess the incremental cost effectiveness ratio of PEP4PA in terms of cost per MET hour and cost per QALY compared to usual programming in the control centers at 12 & 24 months. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older adults are the least active population group in the US. Disparities by income exist for key diseases related to physical activity (PA).

"Effect of Hospital and Community Care Coordination on Health Care Access, Quality and Equity among Individuals with Risk Factors or Diagnosis of ADRD SUMMARY Disparity populations, in particular aging African-Americans and Hispanics (65 years and older), are significantly more likely to have Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) than older Whites in the same age range. Delays in accessing timely primary care, lack of care coordination, and variations in lifestyle and socioeconomic conditions are considered as major factors that contribute to racial and ethnic disparities. Health care coordination, such as chronic care management and post-hospital discharge continuity of care programs, has been identified as a critical component in improving quality of care and patient experience. In addition, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) have been proposed to promote care coordination through team-based approaches and financial incentives. However, little is known about how these system-level care coordination strategies have improved health care access, quality and equity for populations with ADRD. The objective of our project is to determine best hospital-community care coordination practices that can improve effective management of ADRD and co-existing conditions; control/reduce modifiable risk factors of ADRD and administer health care for these diseases in early stages; and eventually promote population health and reduce health disparities. Our primary hypothesis is that integrating hospital and community care can improve quality and equity among people with ADRD as well as cognitively healthy older adults at increased risk for ADRD. We will leverage our comprehensive, national data on care coordination, and construct a multi-level data set (individual-, hospital/ACO-, community-, and state- level) by linking Medicare claims data and Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organizations data to address our primary hypothesis. Using a population-level longitudinal study (2012-2018), we aim to identify the influences of care coordination practices and ACOs on health care access, quality, and cost for people with ADRD and older adults at increased risk for ADRD (including adults living with diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, smoking, and mild cognitive impairment) (Aims 1 and 2); estimate the impact of care coordination on one of the hardest-to-reach populations: racial and ethnic minority populations who received federal housing assistance (who may have experienced periods of homelessness) (Aim 3); and highlight care coordination practices and the ACO models that can reduce racial and ethnic disparities (Aim 4). Our multidisciplinary, systems-based approach will enable us to identify the most critical care coordination practices that will have the greatest impact on increasing effective care for minority patients with ADRD; and control diseases in early stages among those with ADRD risk factors. Our results will provide policy makers with critical information on how to utilize existing resources to integrate care coordination across the health care system to ensure that minorities get access to the most appropriate and effective care. The goal aligns with the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease that aims to enhance care quality and efficiency. NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because results will identify care coordination practices and ACO structures that can promote health care access and quality for people with risk factors or diagnosis of ADRD, with a focus on African Americans, Latinos, and the hardest-to-reach Housing and Urban Development (HUD) population. Results of our study are expected to provide evidence on cost-effective care coordination practices that can make care integration sustainable for underserved populations. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIA’s mission (PAR-18-596): “to consider how institutional and social contexts influence disparities in service access and quality; and identify how regulatory and economic incentives affect access, quality, and health outcomes in health systems for people with dementia.”","Effect of Hospital and Community Care Coordination on Health Care Access,

"PAST-DUE (Prevention and Social Determinants: Disparities and Utilization in Latino Elders) Project Summary/Abstract  Americans aged 60 and over underutilize recommended preventive healthcare. Older Latino-Americans underutilize preventive services to an even greater degree than non-Hispanic whites, but the factors that drive this disparity most heavily are poorly understood. Some evidence in the health services literature suggests that social determinants of health (individual- and community-level economic, social, and environmental factors) affect utilization of preventive health care. It is uncertain, however, which specific services may be most underused by older Latinos, and which social determinants are most strongly associated with this group's utilization.  The dearth of knowledge about social determinants and preventive service utilization in older Latinos is due, at least in part, to the lack of comprehensive data on ambulatory health care utilization linked to data on individual- and community-level social determinants of health. This project will assess disparities in preventive service use between older Latinos and older non-Hispanic Whites, and identify the factors underlying those disparities. To do so, we will leverage a unique data resource from a large, national network of community health centers with shared electronic health record data that is linked to community-level social determinants of health data. This large, longitudinal dataset contains unprecedented data linkages which will let us assess disparities, evaluate which social determinants affect utilization and disparities, and determine which of these may do so most significantly over time; in so doing, we will address an important knowledge gap. Understanding the factors (individual or community) that most heavily impact preventive service use is crucial to the prioritization of population-based interventions to improve preventive screening.  Understanding the relative impact of social determinants of health on preventive service use in older Latinos will enable action/intervention in three ways: 1. It will enable more informed policy decisions to improve public health and wellness in older Americans. 2. It will facilitate strategic partnerships between healthcare providers and community agencies poised to intervene in social factors in the lives of older Americans. 3. It will help clinical providers understand their patients' barriers to care utilization, and further point-of-care efforts to address these barriers that influence their older patients' utilization of recommended health care services. Project Narrative  Many demographic and social factors affect the health of older Latinos in the United States, in part by impacting the use of recommended preventive health care. However, it is unknown which specific factors affect the use of specific preventive care in elders most significantly. This project will use a highly innovative, linked database that combines electronic health care data and community-level information to better understand which social factors most heavily affect the use of preventive care among Latino seniors.",PAST-DUE (Prevention and Social Determinants: Disparities and Utilization in Latino Elders),9787261,R01AG056337,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Americas ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Communities ', ' Economics ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunization ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Language ', ' Literature ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' Community Health Networks ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' care seeking ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Older Population ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Preventive screening ', ' Preventative screening ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' service utilization ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' social health determinants ', ' screening ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' health data ', ' built environment ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive healthcare ', ' Preventive health care ', ' Preventative healthcare ', ' Preventative health care ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' fracture risk ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' data resource ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' patient barriers ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' Migrant ', ' ']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,474320,0.012098677050760403
"The National Health and Aging Trends Study Project Summary The purpose of this application is to extend and enhance the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a national platform for studying late life disability trends and trajectories. The overall aims of NHATS are to 1) promote scientific inquiry into late-life disability trends and dynamics, their antecedents and correlates, and disparities therein and (2) to advance study of the social and economic consequences of late-life disability for individuals, families, and society. To achieve these aims in the next five-year cycle, we will continue the unique key design features of NHATS including collecting data annually and in person from a nationally representative sample of older adults (sampled from the Medicare enrollment file) in 2019-2023 (Rounds 9-13). We will also add several innovative enhancements focused on objective measures of cognitive and sensory capacity and physical activity. Extending NHATS in this way will allow important scientific questions to be addressed concerning both shorter and longer-term in-depth trends in components of the disability process, as well as the dynamics of disability onset, progression and recovery. Specifically, in the next cycle NHATS will 1) Continue collection of the enhanced disability protocol and supplemental questions on disability antecedents and consequences including subjective and economic wellbeing, living and care arrangements, and quality of end of life; and replenish the sample in Round 10 (2020) in order to maintain NHATS' ability to produce 5-year age estimates (up to 90+) and Black-White comparisons; 2) Enrich and expand measurement in the NHATS' annual disability protocol including development and implementation of a) a new iPad-based protocol to enhance measures of cognitive and sensory capacity; and b) a panel substudy of physical activity using accelerometry; and 3) Document and disseminate NHATS data, make available linked claims files and new policy-relevant linkages, and provide new training opportunities to the growing NHATS user community. These aims will allow NHATS to achieve its overarching goal of providing a platform for scientific inquiry to guide efforts to reduce disability, maximize functioning, and enhance older adults' quality of life.

"Equity and Economic Effects of MTM Services Drug-related morbidity and mortality cost the United States over $177.4 billion annually and are especially daunting among the elderly. To improve pharmacotherapy outcomes and reduce costs, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) established medication management therapy (MTM) programs as part of the Medicare prescription drug benefits (Part D) in 2006. Unfortunately, MTM enrollment has fallen below CMS targets mainly due to issues in MTM program design. Further, based on our previous policy scenario analysis, primarily supported by an NIA R01, MTM eligibility criteria may be too restrictive for racial/ethnic minorities and may perpetuate racial/ethnic disparities in health outcomes, because MTM eligibility is based on utilization of medications, which minorities tend to use less. CMS attempted to relax MTM eligibility thresholds, citing our research, but potential disparities remain with the utilization-based eligibility criteria. A critical barrier to effective MTM reform is the lack of stronger information about the actual effects of MTM on minorities' outcomes, utilization of MTM by minorities, and the cost-effectiveness of MTM. We will fill this knowledge gap through our proposed research with newly available MTM data. Our long-term goal is to improve the health status of older adults among diverse populations by improving medication utilization and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization and health outcomes. We will analyze Medicare Parts A/B/D data (2015- 2016), linked to Area Health Resources Files. Our expected outcomes include new information on: (1) effects of MTM on racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization, utilization/costs of health services, and mortality; (2) measures of MTM utilization, such as MTM delivery methods, that exhibit disparity patterns; and (3) cost- effectiveness of MTM from the perspectives of Medicare and health system. We will measure medication utilization using evidence-based statin prescribing and other measures primarily developed by Pharmacy Quality Alliance and adopted by Star Ratings, a health-plan-quality evaluation system tied to CMS bonus payments to Part D plans. Utilization/costs of services include those of physician visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations (e.g., hospitalizations originating from ambulatory care sensitive conditions). We will apply multivariate regression models, a difference-in-difference strategy and negative benefit regression models using frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that MTM programs have reduced racial/ethnic disparities in quality of medication utilization, and health services utilization and costs. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics receive fewer and delayed MTM services than Whites. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that MTM is a cost-effective program. Impact: Our results will provide much- needed empirical evidence to guide MTM policy-making by CMS, and assist the NIA/NIH in its strategic goals of informing “policy decisions” and “understand(ing) health disparities and develop(ing) strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations.” Our long-term goal is to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations by improving medication utilization and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization and health outcomes.

"Older Adults Living with Alzheimer's Disease and their Caregivers: Testing an Evidence-Based Intervention for Underserved Populations The Institute of Medicine identifies sexual/gender minority older adults as one of the most underserved populations, with significant health disparities. This at-risk group faces serious barriers to healthcare access, bias in health settings, and a lack of culturally competent care. The number of sexual/gender minority older adults living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/RD) and their caregivers (CGs) are growing rapidly, and will exceed 4 million by 2060. The lack of efficacious research-based interventions implemented to reduce disability and depression, and improve quality of life for these older adults living with AD/RD and their CGs,is a significant public health problem. Research has documented the protective role of CGs in the health of older adults living with AD/RD as well as CGs' hardships and challenges in caregiving and the impact of caregiving on health deterioration. Caregiving of such vulnerable older adults with AD/RD is particularly of concern due to this population's lower rate of cross-generational ties and their social stigma and isolation, which may be barriers to sustaining caregiving relationships. This project builds on the success of two major NIH projects, Aging with Pride: National Health, Aging, and Sexuality/Gender Study (2R01 AG026526; K. Fredriksen-Goldsen, PI) and Reducing Disabilities in Alzheimer's Disease (RDAD); R01 AG10845; L. Teri, PI) and will test the efficacy of an enhanced RDAD intervention for stigmatized populations addressing identity management, historical trauma and diverse peer support networks. The project will address the following aims: Aim 1. Test the translation and enhancement of RDAD designed to increase physical activities of these vulnerable older adult CRs with AD/RD and their CGs . Aim 2. Evaluate the short- and long-term effect of the enhanced and standard RDAD on primary (physical activity and functioning, perceived stress for CGs, institutionalization for CRs) and secondary outcomes (HRQOL, depressive symptomatology, behavioral disturbances for CRs). Aim 3. Test the moderating roles of CR-CG characteristics, e.g., type of CR-CG relationship, sex, severity of CR AD/RD, on the treatment effect of the standard and enhanced RDAD. This team of nationally recognized experts has more than 20 years of conducting Alzheimer's and minority aging research, with the expertise and established relationships necessary to test the first evidence-based intervention for demographically diverse vulnerable older adults living with AD/RD and their CGs. The findings from this study will be fully disseminated through caregiving and aging agencies, community-based organizations, and research networks across multiple sites and settings. Project Narrative Interventions to meet the health needs of sexual/gender minority older adults living with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (AD/RD) and their caregivers (CGs), as historically marginalized and underserved populations, are critically needed yet not developed. This study will test the translation and enhancement of the first community evidence-based dyadic caregiving intervention, Reducing Disabilities in Alzheimer's Disease, for these vulnerable older adults living with AD/RD to improve quality of life and reduce rates of institutionalization. The findings are critical in designing culturally tailored interventions and policy to respond to health disparities in Alzheimer's care in our increasingly diverse and growing older adult

"Peer Enhanced Depression Care: Using Peer Mentors to Provide Self-Care Support to Low-Income and Minority Older Adults Project Summary Depression is a major burden for minority and low-income older adults who are less likely to use mental health services, and development of new service delivery models is needed to improve the quality of life and address disparities to access for this group. We propose to test the effectiveness of a peer- delivered depression care program that is embedded in the community and linked to the patient's primary care clinic. Our first aim will be to carry out a randomized controlled trial of the Peer Enhanced Depression Care program in which peer mentors who have personal experience of depression meet individually with older adults recruited in the community for 8 weekly meetings focused on relief of depressive symptoms through self-care support and linkages to community resources. This group of low-income and minority older adults in the intervention will be compared to a group that receives non- peer visits that provide social interaction. The Peer Enhanced Depression Care program takes a chronic disease self-management approach and is guided by the conceptual frameworks of social support, peer support, and social learning. Our second aim is to understand mediators such as self-efficacy and loneliness that may be responsible for the intervention effect. Our third aim is to evaluate the implementation of the intervention by conducting interviews with stakeholders, including older adults who received the intervention, peer mentors, social workers, the older adult's primary care physicians and health system administrators to obtain their perspectives on barriers and facilitators to implementation as well as the impact of the Peer Program. Our goal is to use peer-delivered depression care to decrease the mental health morbidity of at-risk low-income and minority adults. The potential public health impact is high because our project seeks to increase access to depression for a vulnerable group of older adults who often do not get care and leverages an existing workforce of peer workers whose services are reimbursed in many states. Narrative Fifteen to twenty percent of older Americans (6 to 8 million people) suffer from depression but more than one- half do not receive any services, a burden disproportionately shared by low-income and minority older adults who receive few or no services. We propose to test a community-based peer model of depression care that provides self-care support for minority and low-income older adults recruited from primary care settings. Our project has potential for high public health impact, specifically, to increase access to depression care for vulnerable and underserved older adults and meet the needs of health systems that are extending beyond medical models of care to include lay worker and community-based resources.",Peer Enhanced Depression Care: Using Peer Mentors to Provide Self-Care Support to Low-Income and Minority Older Adults,9815490,R01MH123165,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Appointment ', ' Charge ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' lonely ', ' Loneliness ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social isolation ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Social Workers ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' Coping Skills ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' information gathering ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Health system ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' community organizations ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' primary care setting ', ' intervention effect ', ' social learning ', ' peer coaching ', ' peer teaching ', ' peer mentoring ', ' peer led team learning ', ' peer instruction ', ' peer support ', ' mentoring community ', ' Relationship-Building ', ' Active Listening ', ' depression model ', ' depressive model ', ' recruit ', ' Service delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' patient response ', ' responsive patient ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,611778,0.01814390604674739
"Finding Solutions for Disparities Associated with Star Ratings Established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Star Ratings system for Medicare Parts C&D (Star Ratings, hereafter) is a health plan quality reporting system with associated bonus payments and enrollment incentives for health plans since 2012. Researchers have reported the disparity implications of Star Ratings: e.g., racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to be excluded from measure calculation for diabetes adherence than non-Hispanic whites, thus minorities may be more likely to be excluded from quality improvement initiations for this measure, potentially worsening disparities in health. A critical barrier for resolving such disparities is that comprehensive policy recommendation related to effects of Star Ratings on racial/ethnic disparities is not available. The goals of this project are to ensure that Star Ratings include a set of measures that address disparities in measure calculation, and to evaluate the effects of Star Ratings bonus payments on reducing racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization. Our strategies are to (1) add to Star Ratings medication utilization measures selected from Pharmacy Quality Alliance measure concept inventory (PMCI), and other commonly used medication utilization (CUMU) measures (Star Plus, hereafter), and (2) compare racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization before and after the implementation of bonus payments, and between counties with “double bonuses” and those with regular bonuses. A project focusing on only medication utilization measures in Star Ratings is warranted because these measures account for a high percentage in Star Ratings scores (45% in Part D in 2013) and their correlation with other measures is only moderate. Bonus payments are associated with improved plan benefit structure, which may reduce racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization. In the prior grant period we found that selecting appropriate medication utilization measures may resolve racial/ethnic disparities associated with a Medicare Part D policy. Our objective of this continuation project is to conduct an analysis of Medicare Parts A/B/D data (2010-2015), linked to Area Health Resources Files, Orange Book Data Files, and CMS data on double/regular-bonus counties. We will also conduct disease-specific analysis. Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that using the medication utilization measures in current Star Ratings negatively affects the health of racial/ethnic minorities. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that using Star Plus can lead to a reduction in racial/ethnic disparities associated with Star Ratings. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that the Star Ratings bonus payments are associated with reduction in racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization. Our expected outcome is to provide policy recommendations to resolve important disparity issues in Star Ratings among diverse older adults. Impact: This project will help to align disparity reduction goals with rapidly-proliferating pay-for-performance and public-reporting initiatives. This project is responsive to the National Institute on Aging's mission-driven strategic goal to “understand health disparities and develop strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations.” The goals of this project are to evaluate effects of Medicare Parts C&D Star Ratings (Star Ratings, hereafter) bonus payments on racial and ethnic disparities and ensure that Star Ratings include a set of measures that address the disparities in measure calculation. Our expected outcome is to produce comprehensive policy recommendations to resolve important disparity issues in Star Ratings among older adults in diverse populations. Our project will (1) provide the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services with information needed to align disparity reduction goals with rapidly-proliferating pay-for-performance and public-reporting initiatives; and (2) provide the National Institute on Aging with support to achieve its strategic goal of “understanding health disparities and develop strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations.”",Finding Solutions for Disparities Associated with Star Ratings,9781644,R01AG049696,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Books ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incentives ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Medicare Hospital Insurance Program ', ' Medicare Part A ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Data Files ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Quality Indicator ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' Stretching ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' Medicare Part C ', ' Medicare Plus Choice ', ' Medicare Choice ', ' Structure ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Oranges ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Proliferating ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Concept Inventory ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' health plan ', ' health plans ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2019,334400,0.021554965263151562
"Asian Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) Abstract: Overall RCMAR  We propose the Chicago Asian RCMAR to advance careers of investigators from underrepresented populations through translational trauma and resilience research amongst one of the most understudied, yet fastest growing populations in the U.S.: Asian American older adults. Such an important focus in research, population and investigators will inform both practice and policy at community, regional and national levels. Asians are the fastest growing yet most understudied US minority group at 21 million people and growing 56% from 2000-2013. Yet, < 1% of NIH research funding in the last 10 years were focused on US Asian populations, with only 3-5 total funded NIH grants/yr that focus on US Asian older adults. Moreover, this population experiences the “Asian Paradox”: while on average, US Asians, are the highest-income earners and the most highly-educated, more Asians, especially older adults, live below the poverty line, are less likely to participate in biomedical research, and suffer disproportional health disparities compared to white Americans. These health inequities are further complicated by the heterogeneity of these immigrant populations, especially with respect to culture, religion, language, sexual identity, and trauma exposure, many of which challenge our assumptions about the “model minority” stereotype. Such exposures and heterogeneities lead to isolation and further removal from opportunities to participate in research, thus restricting benefits conferred from population level research. However, despite this diversity, there are unifying themes across Asian cultures with regard to shared experiences of immigration, trauma, strong family bonds, cultural values and expectations, and the intergenerational nature of the aging process.  Building on two decades of rigorous aging research in minority populations and track records of successful academic achievements, we have leveraged strong existing transdisciplinary partnerships across multiple academic and community institutions to build a center designed to foster the next generation of diverse researchers in a nurturing environment that is conducive to success and promotes highly relevant and rigorous trauma, resilience and health outcomes research among Asian American older adults. We propose the following scientific lines of inquiry: 1) Understand the cross-ethnic variations in the social, cultural, and behavioral mechanisms of trauma and stress across Asian populations; 2) Explore the potential differential health outcomes associated with trauma, immigration, and mechanisms of resilience in ameliorating adverse consequences among Asian populations; and 3) Build institutional and community capacity that tests and adapts and implements evidence based behavioral change strategies to prevent and treat trauma, promote resilience, and mitigate the effect of stressful events in Asian aging populations. The overall aims of the application reflect the synergistic work of Administrative (AC), Research Education (REC), Measurement and Analysis (AnC) and Community Liaison & Recruitment (CLRC) Cores. Project Narrative: Overall RCMAR Despite the growth of US Asian populations, there are vast gaps in our knowledge regarding the social and cultural contributors to and consequences of trauma among Asian older adults, who are predominantly immigrants. In the Chicago Asian RCMAR, we will establish 4 complementary cores to achieve the mission of the Center, to improve Asian American older adult health through spawning research and a new cohort of diverse scientists that focus on this population.",Asian Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR),9776418,P30AG059304,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immigration ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Records ', ' Religion ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Accountability ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' expectation ', ' cultural values ', ' outreach ', ' Academic achievement ', ' social ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Future Generations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' investigator training ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' evidence base ', ' social science research ', ' health equity ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' education research ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' recruit ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' Infrastructure ', ' sexual identity ', ' ']",NIA,RUTGERS BIOMEDICAL/HEALTH SCIENCES-RBHS,P30,2019,1216314,0.02684855469214709
"Expanding the CAARN to accelerate research on multiple chronic conditions with rural and African-American communities and health-care providers Project Summary/Abstract Three out of four older adults live with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) that worsen health, shorten life span, and increase healthcare costs; this burden disproportionally affects African Americans. Despite the critical need for interventions to help older patients with MCCs improve self-management, existing programs have limited reach and effectiveness in underserved communities. Our long term goal is to increase the number and reach of self-management interventions available to improve the health of older adults with MCCs. The objective of this proposal is to create a mature and sustainable infrastructure that facilitates the formation and collaboration of research teams focused on the development and dissemination of effective new self-management interventions for older adults from African American and rural communities with MCCs. To achieve this goal, we will expand the Community-Academic Aging Research Network (CAARN), originally created in 2010 with NIH funding to facilitate development, testing, and/or dissemination of behavioral interventions to improve the health of older adults. To date, CAARN has facilitated community-research partnerships between 46 investigators and social services providers in 52 counties and 1 tribe. We propose to expand CAARN’s infrastructure from its primarily rural focus, to increase partnerships with health systems and African American communities, by providing: 1) trained research liaisons from partnering organizations representing health systems and African-American stakeholders; 2) training for researchers on building trust with African- American communities; 3) multidisciplinary experts who will consult during the design phase of interventions. These additions create a mature, sustainable CAARN infrastructure to accomplish our aims: Aim 1: Facilitate research to develop and test the feasibility of new multi-morbidity self-management programs for older adults that focus on activating patients towards self-management and empowering them to continuously engage in goal-setting and shared decision-making with their provider(s) to maximize behavior change; Aim 2: Demonstrate the effectiveness of new self-management programs for older adults with MCCs in improving quality of life, with a concentrated focus on rural and African-American older adults; Aim 3: Facilitate research to maximize dissemination, implementation, and reach of effective multi-morbidity self- management programs, particularly in rural and African-American populations. Using principles of community- based participatory research, CAARN will engage stakeholders from health systems, rural, and African- American communities on multidisciplinary research teams to develop, test, and research how best to disseminate interventions to reduce the substantial burden of MCCs. This should increase the availability of, and decrease the time to dissemination of, effective, practical interventions that are tailored to these communities and integrated into health systems to improve communications, clinical care, and health equity. Project Narrative This proposal will expand the infrastructure of the Community-Academic Aging Research Network (CAARN) by adding new interdisciplinary researchers and new partners from health care systems and African-American communities to facilitate community-based participatory research to develop, test, and research how best to disseminate new self-management interventions for older adults with multiple chronic conditions.",Expanding the CAARN to accelerate research on multiple chronic conditions with rural and African-American communities and health-care providers,9825163,R33AG061699,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Insurance ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Program Development ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tribes ', ' Wisconsin ', ' County ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Rural Community ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' Consult ', ' empowered ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Allied Health Profession ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' health literacy ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' implementation science ', ' clinical care ', ' health equity ', ' shared decision making ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' program dissemination ', ' project dissemination ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' rural African American ', ' rural underserved ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' service providers ', ' self-management program ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R33,2019,688929,0.14694366829226044
"Understanding disparities in the adoption and use of assistive technology by older Hispanics Project Summary/Abstract The proportion of older Hispanics who have disabilities and are living independently in Puerto Rico is substantially higher than older adults from any other race and ethnicity living in the United States. Loss of function in old age eventually leads to institutionalization and early death. Use of assistive technology (AT) is an important strategy to manage disabilities, increase independence, and ensure the safety of older adults. Despite evidence that older Hispanics experience more functional disabilities throughout their later life, they are among the least likely to use and access AT devices. Barriers to AT use among people with a variety of disabilities have been studied, which include the cost of AT, lack of AT awareness/information, limited availability of providers, stigma, and lack of perceived need. However, it is unknown how gender inequalities among the multilevel factors that influence AT use could be reflected upon gender differences in the adoption and use of AT. The main objectives of the proposed study are to: 1) identify functional disabilities that can be mitigated by AT among community-living Hispanics, 65 years and older, with functional disabilities; 2) compare functional disability types (i.e., personal care activities, daily living activities, and functional mobility) between men and women; and 3) understand the multilevel factors (i.e., person, environment, technology, activities, access to and control over resources, bargaining positions, and gender norms) that result in barriers and facilitators to using AT. To meet these aims, this project interdisciplinary team of researchers will first collect and analyze data obtained from the administration of both the PROMIS® Physical Function Short Form and a socio-demographic questionnaire to 250 older Hispanics; then, follow with the collection and analysis of individual qualitative interviews (assisted by AT videos) from a sub-sample of 24 participants. Participants will be purposively recruited from a low-income community in Puerto Rico because they are the most likely to experience barriers to accessing health care and AT services. The researchers have incorporated a community-based organization and their community advisory board to collaborate in the implementation and interpretation of the results of this study. The expected outcome is to improve the understanding of gender differences in different types of disabilities as well as the differences in the barriers and facilitators for using different types of AT. The results of this mixed method study will lay the foundation for the subsequent design and testing of a culturally-competent, gender-sensitive intervention aimed at increasing AT device use by older Hispanics, thereby enhancing their daily function, quality of life, and opportunities for ageing in place. This goal supports the NINR mission to prevent disabilities and advance the health and quality of life of underserved minority populations. Narrative The proposed revised R21 research will contribute fundamental new knowledge about the factors that influence the adoption and use of assistive technologies (AT) among older Hispanics living in a low-income community to compensate for their disabilities in daily life activities and how these factors differ by gender. This new knowledge will serve to identify effective strategies that will be incorporated in a culturally-competent AT self-management intervention to promote the adoption and use of AT to increase older Hispanics function, quality of life, and opportunities for aging in place.

"DECISION-MAKING IN YOUNGER AND OLDER ADULTS: A DISCOUNTING FRAMEWORK Summary/Abstract Older adults often face important decisions more complicated than those usually studied in the laboratory, where choices are typically between immediate and delayed outcomes or between certain and probabilistic outcomes. In research with younger adults, such simple choices are often studied under the rubric of self-control, but recent findings suggest that rather than being a single construct, self-control may be better thought of as a collection of skills and abilities. Even fundamental decision-making processes (e.g., delay discounting or intertemporal choice; probability discounting or risky choice) may be more diverse than originally thought. With respect to age- related differences in these fundamental processes, moreover, there is a striking lack of consensus as to what changes occur as people age. We hypothesize that this picture can be greatly clarified by taking into account the presence of sex differences and income inequalities. Once the picture has been clarified, we will be well- positioned to study how fundamental decision-making processes combine in complex choice situations that are more like those that older adults, as well as younger adults, encounter every day. Therefore, Specific Aim 1 will study simple inter-temporal and risky choices involving gains and losses with the goal of understanding the structure of these fundamental decision-making abilities (e.g., the extent to which the abilities reflect a general impulsivity factor) and whether the relations among them differ in younger and older adults, thereby providing a baseline against which we then will compare the relations among abilities in more ecologically valid situations. Aim 2 will examine decision-making when choices involve outcomes that are both delayed and probabilistic, as in investments and many other financial decisions. Aim 3 focuses on decision- making when the outcomes involve both gains and losses that occur at different points in time, as in many health decisions (e.g., diets and vaccinations). Aim 4 examines choices with outcomes that differ qualitatively as well as in their time of occurrence, as when people choose between taking a vacation now or saving the money to purchase some desired good later. We plan to examine age-related differences with the goal of determining the strengths and weaknesses in older adults’ decision-making in all of the preceding ecologically valid situations. For each Aim, we will recruit participants to be tested in the laboratory using computerized tasks to assess the subjective values of potential outcomes as well as online using questionnaires previously validated in the lab. Our studies will be guided by the hypothesis that decisions involving outcomes with multiple attributes are more cognitively demanding and therefore more sensitive to age-related differences in basic cognitive abilities. These studies will also test new models of decision-making that we have developed for ecologically valid situations, models we believe will inform our analysis of age-related differences. Finally, we will examine the interaction of sex and income differences with age-related changes in decision-making, all as part of our effort to identify potential targets of interventions such as “nudges” to help older adults compensate for any specific weaknesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The need to simultaneously evaluate delayed and probabilistic costs and benefits is a critical part of the daily life of older adults. However, people often make bad decisions when delayed and probabilistic outcomes are involved, with substance abuse and gambling representing extreme, but not unusual, examples, even in older adults. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of older adults’ decision-making, the goal of the proposed research, will help in finding potential targets for interventions (e.g., ‘nudges’) designed to help older adults compensate for any specific weaknesses that we identify.",DECISION-MAKING IN YOUNGER AND OLDER ADULTS: A DISCOUNTING FRAMEWORK,9761420,R01AG058885,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Decision Making ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Gambling ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Persons ', ' Probability ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Savings ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Woman ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Inequality ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Self-control as a personality trait ', ' self control ', ' age difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Low income ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' discount ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' discounting ', ' cognitive ability ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,344850,0.15151494852616026
"University of Florida Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the University of Florida Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) is twofold: 1) to optimize older persons' physical performance and mobility through interdisciplinary approaches; and 2) to train new investigators in aging and disability research while developing their leadership qualities. Our goal is to enhance late-life health and independence, with a special focus on mobility. To accomplish our mission, our strategy is to attract studies and inventive investigators from diverse behavioral, clinical, basic, and technological science disciplines with a common research focus: “mobility and prevention of disability.” Traversing the entire spectrum of biomedical investigation, including molecular biology, animal studies, clinical research, behavioral sciences, epidemiology, and engineering, our research effort addresses the OAIC's general goal: to increase scientific knowledge that leads to better ways to maintain or restore independence of older people. Our research objectives are to: 1) assess, using translational research (among diverse disciplines), the biological, co-morbid, psychosocial, behavioral, and other factors that contribute to physical function decline, loss of mobility, and progression toward disability; and 2) develop and reliably test, in clinical and preclinical studies, interventions that target mobility to prevent, delay, or recover the age-related declines in physical function. Our educational objective is to train future leaders in clinical translational research on aging. To meet these objectives the proposed OAIC trains Junior Scholars and supports investigators, resources, services, external studies, development projects, and pilot/exploratory studies through seven integrated cores:  • Leadership and Administrative Core;  • Research Education Core;  • Pilot/Exploratory Studies Core;  • Clinical Research Core;  • Metabolism and Translational Science Core;  • Biostatistics Core; and  • Data Science and Applied Technology Core.  A relevant strength of the proposed OAIC is the concerted action of the interdisciplinary cores, projects, and investigators who address one common research focus spanning the entire spectrum of biomedical investigation.

"Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes Project Summary/Abstract The Hispanic population in the U.S. aged 65 and older has been growing rapidly and is projected to increase 5- fold between 2012 and 2050, when Hispanics are expected to make up more than 18% of the older adult population. Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. Disease diagnosis is often the basis for estimating prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in the population. People of Hispanic origin, however, are at greater risk of under diagnosis because of the unique challenges they face accessing and interacting with the health care system. The main objectives of the proposed project are two-fold: 1) to obtain estimates of hypertension and diabetes prevalence for different Hispanic subpopulations, defined by ethnic origin, nativity, and time in the U.S.; and 2) to determine how sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment interact to influence risk for hypertension and diabetes. Data for this project come from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which includes a large diverse sample of Hispanics, information on both disease diagnosis and direct assessments of disease risk, and contextual data on the social, economic, and health care environment. Multilevel modeling and logistic regression models will be used to: 1) examine the association between sociocultural factors and reported and measured disease prevalence; 2) determine if variation in health insurance and health care utilization accounts for Hispanic group differences in hypertension and diabetes; and 3) determine if variation in the sociomedical environment account for Hispanic differences in hypertension and diabetes. Results from the proposed project will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities. Project Narrative Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. This study will integrate multilevel information on sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment to advance understanding of the risks for developing hypertension and diabetes among older Hispanic populations. Results from the study will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities, and will inform interventions targeted at addressing disease burden to improve quality of life among Hispanics.",Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes,9616227,R36AG057949,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' Physical environment ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R36,2019,73946,0.01571400556585323
"Understanding physical function in older African immigrants: the roles of acculturation and racial discrimination Abstract Physical function is an important public health concern in older African immigrants because poor physical function leads to worse health outcomes, affects quality of life and is costly to the health system. Physical function difficulties are prevalent in older adults; 33-40% of community dwelling older adults report at least one difficulty. African immigrants are one of the fastest growing immigrant groups and nearly 20% of them are older than 55 years. To prevent future disability and improve quality of life for this population, there is a need to understand the experience of physical function difficulty in older African immigrants. Acculturation and racial discrimination are associated with poorer physical function in other racial/ethnic immigrant groups and native born Blacks. Older African immigrants experience acculturation and high rates of racial discrimination; however, it is not known if these affect physical function in African immigrants. Guided by Berry’s acculturation theory and the Disablement process model, the purpose of the proposed study is to understand older African immigrants’ experiences of living with physical function difficulties; in particular the roles of acculturation and racial discrimination. A mixed methods design will be used to get an in-depth understanding of these concepts and relationships in this population. Older African immigrants (≥55years) will be recruited through community based organizations that serve African immigrants in the Baltimore- Washington Metropolitan area. We will utilize the 20 item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function (PROMIS-PF20) to assess participants’ difficulties in performing daily tasks such as bending, carrying groceries and bathing. Use of the PROMIS PF20 measure in this population will enable us to compare participants’ physical function results to the general population, since scores using this scale are normed the general population. The specific aims of this study are 1) Examine the relationship between acculturation and physical function difficulties in older African immigrants. 2) Determine the relationship between racial discrimination and physical function difficulties in older African immigrants. 3) Describe the physical function of older African immigrants and explore whether acculturation and racial discrimination affect physical function difficulties. This study aligns with the National Institute on Aging’s objective to understand the differences and health inequities experienced by older minority populations. Findings from this study can contribute to the development of culturally tailored interventions to decrease physical function difficulties in older African immigrants, towards the goal of decreasing inequities in the burden of physical function difficulties in foreign born Blacks. Project Narrative An increasing number of older Africans are migrating to the United States and the physical function of this population is not well understood. The proposed study will contribute to the understanding of factors associated with physical function difficulties in older African immigrants. Knowledge gained from this study will inform the development of strategies to improve physical function and health outcomes in older African immigrants.",Understanding physical function in older African immigrants: the roles of acculturation and racial discrimination,9757587,F31AG057166,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Baltimore ', ' Berry ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Immigration ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Methods ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' United States ', ' Washington ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native-Born ', ' Walking ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Baths ', ' Bathing ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' African ', ' Measurement ', ' Immigrant ', ' Inflammatory ', ' cooking ', ' Knowledge ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Physical Function ', ' experience ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' stressor ', ' metropolitan ', ' Proxy ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Health system ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,21140,0.07573856477363262
"Access to Community Based Palliative Care among Medically-Underserved Older Adults ABSTRACT Exploring the palliative care needs of medically underserved older adults  in East and Central Harlem As Americans live longer and the proportion of people 65 years of age and older grows from 14% of the population to 20% by midcentury, the growing incidence of age-related chronic illnesses will increasingly represent a critical public health concern. An estimated 80% of older adults have one chronic illness or condition (e.g., cancer, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias), and half of older adults experience two or more of these conditions. Chronic conditions are frequently accompanied by high symptom burden, including pain, fatigue, mobility problems, anxiety and depression, which are associated with diminished self-rated health and quality of life, frequent use of costly healthcare services, and ultimately threaten the ability to live independently. Palliative care has emerged as an effective strategy to address the profound human and economic costs of living with chronic and advanced illness. A substantial body of evidence suggests that delivering early, high-quality palliative care to this population significantly improves patient outcomes across critical domains by reducing pain and symptoms, enhancing patient and caregiver wellbeing, lengthening survival, and containing overall health care costs for the highest need users. Despite these promising outcomes, there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in access to high quality palliative care, particularly among older adults living in low-income communities. This longitudinal, mixed-method study explores the experiences and supportive care needs of community-dwelling chronically-ill African American and Latino older adults after discharge to the community from an inpatient palliative care service. The specific aims are to: 1) describe the needs and perceptions of chronically-ill, low- income African-American and Latino older adults living in the community, the conditions and contexts under which they access high quality palliative care, and the barriers they face in accessing and using palliative care post-discharge; 2) explore palliative care providers' perceptions of underserved older adults' needs for palliative care, and the strategies providers use to access these individuals and provide them with needed services; and 3) shed light on the mechanisms that explain palliative care disparities, and suggest strategies to advance culturally competent, measurable, and sustained improvements in coordination of comprehensive palliative care for community-dwelling African-American and Latino older adults. Overall, the study will advance our scientific understanding of palliative care disparities and help reduce multi-level barriers to meeting the needs of all community-dwelling older adults with chronic and advanced illness. Successful achievement of these aims will enhance our understanding of the barriers and facilitators to palliative care and suggest factors to expand these services to a growing population of underserved community-dwelling older adults. Findings from these exploratory data will form the basis of an R01 application to further develop and pilot innovative interventions to better meet the palliative care needs of chronically-ill, low-income African American and Latino older adults in the community. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE STATEMENT This study will contribute to the understanding of underlying causes of significant racial and ethnic disparities in access to and utilization of high-quality palliative care among community-dwelling, low-income African American and Latino older adults. Grounded in a multifactorial framework of micro-, mezzo- and macro-level influences, the study integrates community-based participatory research and grounded theory approaches to elicit the unique perspectives of ethnically diverse palliative care patients and palliative care providers at a public community hospital. An increased understanding of barriers and facilitators to palliative care will contribute to development of interventions that expand this critical resource to underserved community- dwelling older adults, thus addressing serious health disparities experienced by this population.",Access to Community Based Palliative Care among Medically-Underserved Older Adults,9756415,SC2GM121269,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Communities ', ' Living Costs ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Palliative Medicine ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' advanced disease ', ' advanced illness ', ' economic cost ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' family support ', ' Caregiver well-being ', ' caregiver wellbeing ', ' care giver wellbeing ', ' care giver well-being ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' pain symptom ', ' painful symptom ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' pain reduction ', ' reduce pain ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' ']",NIGMS,HUNTER COLLEGE,SC2,2019,156000,0.18873013883164058
"Midwest Roybal Center for Health Promotion and Translation Abstract Overall Our proposed UIC Midwest Roybal Center for Health Promotion and Translation seeks to accelerate the translation of behavioral research theories into practical outcomes to improve the functioning and quality of life of older adults. Our work recognizes that interventions that target individuals take place in families, neighborhoods, and communities that are impacted by external factors that influence initiation and maintenance of behavior change. Our work is guided by the RE-AIM Framework to identify health promotion interventions that have the greatest potential for broad based public health impact. Our Center will support the design and testing of principle-driven, potent health promotion interventions that have strong promise of progressing through the NIH Stage Change Model. Our proposed renewal Center retains its current focus on designing interventions for older racial/ethnic minority adults and expands the focus of our health behavior interventions to include cognitive health. This renewal application targets four thematic areas of focus: physical activity promotion; enhancing mobility, defined broadly to include improved cognitive function gait, balance, and walking; harnessing technology to improve intervention scalability and fidelity; and incorporating mechanisms of action that will sustain behavior change. Our Management team, Senior Leaders and Principal Investigators of funded pilot projects will constitute the Center Research Faculty. The Management team and Senior Leaders have experience conducting research across all stages of the Stage Model and will work to transition promising pilots across the Stages as quickly as possible. The Pilot PIs will be responsible for completing all activities proposed in their projects, under the oversight of the Management Core. The Pilot Core will provide grant funding for up to two pilots per year, solicited from all departments across UIC and other University of Illinois campuses. The renewal Center Executive Committee is comprised of Senior Leaders and Chairs of multiple departments at UIC, all of which are critical to fulfilling the mission of the Center. The overall performance of the Center will be guided by a distinguished Advisory Committee that includes representatives from diverse academic, provider, funder, consumer, and media stakeholder groups. Finally, this renewal application incorporates for the first time a Multi-modal ADRD Imaging and Connectomics Core that will enable investigators to perform brain imaging, interpretation, and storage and provide access to uniform cognitive and physical activity measures.

"Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research Overall Abstract The Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR), a mature social and behavioral science center of the Resource Center for Minority Aging Research program, proposes to expand its reach and impact by mentoring junior faculty (most of whom will be African American) and by focusing on African American Life-course health research. Michigan State University (MSU) will formally join the University of Michigan (UM) and Wayne State University (WSU) to form the new MCUAAAR. Our three specific aims include: 1) Increase reach and coverage by including Michigan State University as a full partner in the MCUAAAR; 2) Recruit and mentor 15 new junior researchers; and, 3) Increase important research on the life-course experiences of older adults of diverse ethnic and racial populations, especially African Americans. Four cores are proposed in this application; Administrative, Analytic, REC and CLRC. We will employ an integrative approach to mentoring, entailing a structured set of activities and training across the pilot funding period: (a) Formal goals will be set at the beginning of the pilot and reviewed in monthly MCUAAAR meetings; (b) Based on the goals set, a mentoring team will be assembled to assist with research, dissemination of findings, and research translation; (c) A set of training activities in scientific writing, measurement, and community-based research partnerships will be conducted each year; (d) A formal six-month evaluation will be conducted and shared with the MCUAAAR faculty; and, (e) During the second year, an ongoing MCUAAAR mentor will be assigned to assist with publications and grant preparation and provide support to junior researchers attending conferences. There will also be opportunities for longer-term mentoring and training in the program. We continue to be motivated by an NIH-funded series of studies (e.g., Ginther et al., 2011) in which applications from black scientists were shown to be 10 percentage points less likely to obtain grant awards than applications from white investigators; in practical terms, this gap means that white applicants are about twice as likely as blacks to be approved and funded. The RCMAR program has been important in helping to eliminate this gap for RCMAR researchers overall, and we continue to focus on the importance of abolishing the disparity for African American researchers in particular. We are also motivated by the continuing disparities in chronic disease and mortality among older African Americans.

"Advancing Health Disparities Research in Aging: The Aging Research in Criminal Justice & Health (ARCH) Network Project Summary / Abstract Despite 20 years of unprecedented growth in the number of criminal justice-involved older adults (those under arrest, in court, in prison or jail, on probation or parole), the knowledge needed to develop evidence-based interventions for this population with high rates of early onset disease, disability and behavioral and social risk factors, is deeply under- developed. In particular, research to understand the life course experiences, the social determinants of health, and the drivers of later life health disparities in this population, including criminal justice involvement itself, is limited. Moreover, much of the research about this population has failed to study geriatric conditions (e.g., functional and cognitive impairment, falls, elder abuse, polypharmacy) that are key to understanding the health and wellbeing of older adults at each phase of criminal justice involvement (from arrest through community reintegration after incarceration). This lack of knowledge has profound impacts on public health as over 95% of incarcerated patients are eventually released to the community where they disproportionately rely on community safety net healthcare systems. The relative lack of evidence in this area of aging and health disparities research reflects, in part, professional isolation among the growing number of researchers who study aging and criminal justice involvement – many of them early in their careers – from a range of academic disciplines (e.g. medicine, public health, nursing, epidemiology, social welfare) spread throughout the nation with few centered at any one institution. As a result, vital interdisciplinary research collaborations are limited and junior researchers often lack the mentorship needed to pursue a successful research career in this area. In response, we propose developing The ARCH (Aging Research in Criminal justice & Health) Network to build research capacity in this emerging field and catalyze the impactful research needed to develop evidence-based interventions that meet the needs of this historically overlooked population of older adults. To meet these goals, we propose two specific aims: (1) to establish a multidisciplinary national research network to develop and refine the research agenda, measures, and methods needed to advance research on the health and social drivers of criminal justice involvement and health disparities among older adults over the life course and the consequences of criminal justice involvement on health in later life; and (2) to support new and established scientists to develop and implement life course research on the health of criminal justice-involved older adults by offering a research technical assistance program, creating a national mentorship program for junior investigators, directly funding pilot and exploratory research, and creating formal opportunities for networking to develop new multidisciplinary research collaborations. The ARCH Network will ensure that geriatric principles are front and center in studying the health and healthcare needs of criminal justice-involved older adults and will develop a research agenda that can inform correctional and community healthcare systems of opportunities across the life course where programmatic and policy interventions can be tested to reduce health disparities for this population. Project Narrative The number of criminal justice-involved older adults has risen dramatically in recent decades, resulting in a largely overlooked population of older adults with high rates of health disparities and profound, often co-occurring social and medical vulnerabilities. Yet health research has failed to keep pace with this demographic change, particularly in areas of knowledge that are critical to developing interventions to meet this population’s unique needs, including geriatric health, life course experiences, and the social determinants of health. This proposal will establish The ARCH (Aging Research in Criminal justice & Health) Network, a nationwide, multi-disciplinary community of emerging and established researchers, to catalyze research and interventions designed to improve health and social outcomes in the growing population of criminal justice-involved older adults.",Advancing Health Disparities Research in Aging: The Aging Research in Criminal Justice & Health (ARCH) Network,9859173,R24AG065175,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Arkansas ', ' Award ', ' California ', ' Capsicum ', ' pepper ', ' Communities ', ' Criminology ', ' senior abuse ', ' elderly abuse ', ' elder mistreatment ', ' elder maltreatment ', ' abuse of older adults ', ' Elder Abuse ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' Drug Laws ', ' Drug Legislation ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Medicine ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Prisons ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Nurses ', ' Public Health Nursing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Police ', ' falls ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' career ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Area ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Discipline ', ' Homelessness ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Collaborations ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' probation ', ' social ', ' parole ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Jail ', ' Consent ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' lifetime risk ', ' life-time risk ', ' Older Population ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' early onset ', ' neglect ', ' community reintegration ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' safety net ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' community safety ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health research ', ' social health determinants ', ' racial bias ', ' race bias ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R24,2019,372143,0.06460163622250631
"Epidemiology of racial differences in decision making among older adults ABSTRACT Sound decision making is important for maintaining independence and well-being across the lifespan but is critical in old age, when some of life’s most complex and impactful decisions are made. Recent work from our group and others has shown that decision making requires cognitive, contextual and psychosocial resources and that many older persons—even those without cognitive impairment—are vulnerable to poor decision making in key domains such as finance and health and frequently become victims of fraud. Poor decision making in aging predicts several adverse health outcomes including Alzheimer’s disease, incident mild cognitive impairment and mortality and poses a major public health and economic challenge. Importantly, however, most of the research on decision making to date has involved White participants. Relatively little is known about decision making among African Americans, despite well documented racial differences in the cognitive, contextual (e.g., socioeconomic status) and psychosocial (e.g., psychological distress) resources that influence decision making. Building on our conceptual model of decision making in aging and compelling preliminary data that suggest racial differences, we hypothesize that racial differences in decision making contribute to disparities in health outcomes and that contextual and psychosocial factors account for these differences. The goal of the proposed study, submitted in response to PAR-16-448, is to elucidate the determinants and adverse health consequences of racial differences in decision making. This study will leverage the unique resources of an ongoing study of African Americans, the Minority Aging Research Study, to collect new longitudinal data on multiple aspects of decision making (i.e., financial and health decision making, temporal discounting, scam susceptibility, fraud victimization) and related contextual and psychosocial factors in 600 older African Americans without dementia. These newly collected data will be linked with identical longitudinal decision making data already available from an ongoing study of more than 1,100 Whites from the Memory and Aging Project to support analyses of: 1) racial differences in decision making among African Americans and Whites matched on demographics and cognition, 2) the contextual and psychosocial factors that drive them, and 3) the degree to which racial differences in decision making contribute to disparities in health. Thus, this study is uniquely poised to efficiently identify the determinants and public health impact of racial differences in decision making and will facilitate new therapeutic approaches to promote independence, health and well-being among diverse older persons. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this study is to identify the determinants and adverse health consequences of racial differences in decision making among older adults. This study will yield new knowledge that is critically important for identifying modifiable targets for interventions to reduce racial differences in decision making and associated health disparities including the risk of Alzheimer’s disease among diverse older adults.",Epidemiology of racial differences in decision making among older adults,9775231,R01AG060376,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Cognition ', ' Decision Making ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Fraud ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Memory ', ' mortality ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' disability ', ' Trust ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' discount ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' health literacy ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' discounting ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' demographics ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive ability ', ' rate of change ', ' financial literacy ', ' ']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,622634,0.023100207124117325
"Evaluating disparities in older adult health, institutionalization, and mortality after implementation of Medicaid's Balancing Incentives Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Formal, or paid long term service and support (LTSS) have estimated annual costs of $211 to $306 billion in the U.S. and these expenditures are expected to rise as Baby Boomers age. Demographic trends including smaller family sizes, increased female workforce participation, and longer lifespans will reduce the availability of family caregivers, placing further burden on the formal LTSS system and especially on Medicaid, the nation's largest single payer of formal LTSS. Medicaid has been at the forefront of policy efforts to ""rebalance"" LTSS from institutional to home-and community-based settings. These rebalancing efforts reflect individuals' preferences to receive home- and community-based services (HCBS) and these transitions have also been shown to save about 15% in per capita LTSS spending over 10 years. In spite of this increased focus, evaluations of these rebalancing policies have largely neglected health and mortality outcomes, disparities in outcomes, and effects on older adults with specific health conditions such as dementia, who may have higher than average Medicaid expenditures. The most recently implemented rebalancing policy is the Balancing Incentive Program (BIP), which offers additional funding to states to increase access to LTSS in states that were spending less than 50% of LTSS expenditures on HCBS. We will conduct the first formal evaluation of BIP's effects on four health outcomes: self-rated health, functioning, long-term institutionalization, and mortality. There is reason to suspect that disparities in these outcomes may also be affected after BIP's implementation, as whites and minorities tend to employ very different LTSS strategies and have different levels of access to care. Similarly, individuals living in rural areas are more likey than their urban counterparts to have few or distant medical providers and fragmented care coordination, all of which limit their ability to obtain necessary care and adversely affect individual and population health outcomes. This proposal employs a mixed-method approach to (1) conduct qualitative analyses to identify states' BIP implementation stages and challenges; (2) test the effect of BIP implementation on the four health outcomes using a difference-in- difference approach that capitalizes on the quasi-experimental framework to compare states that did and did not (but were eligible to) implement BIP; (3) assess racial/ethnic and rural/urban differences in BIP's effects on health; and (4) examine whether health conditions and access to informal care (unpaid care generally provided by family), and county- or state-level access to formal care further modify the effects of BIP on health outcomes and disparities. Multiple administrative and survey databases spanning 2008-2017 will be merged to examine health outcomes for dual-eligible adults 65 years and older who live in BIP and non-BIP states. The goal of this study is to provide policymakers with rigorous analyses of BIP's effects on health and health disparities. While these analyses focus on BIP, the results have implications for HCBS more generally and for understanding how rebalancing policies influence health and health disparities in older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal evaluates the U.S.'s most recent long-term services and supports (LTSS) rebalancing policy, the Balancing Incentive Program (BIP), which bolsters participating states' ability to increase access to care in home- and community-based settings. We will examine how BIP implementation influences older adults' self- reported health, functioning measured by activities of daily living, risk of long-term institutionalization, and ris of mortality. Further, we test whether BIP implementation reduces or exacerbates existing racial/ethnic and rural/urban disparities in these outcomes. We also examine whether these effects vary by an individual's health conditions, access to informal (unpaid) care from family members, and access to formal (paid) care at the county and state levels.","Evaluating disparities in older adult health, institutionalization, and mortality after implementation of Medicaid's Balancing Incentives Program",9612358,R01MD010360,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Family Sizes ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' home healthcare ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Institutionalization ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Social Policies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Leanness ', ' Thinness ', ' Urban Health ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' patient home care ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Single-Payer System ', ' single payer ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Distant ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' success ', ' Stretching ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' dual eligible ', ' community based service ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' waiver ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' informal care ', ' urban residence ', ' urban disparity ', ' rural dwellers ', ' rural resident ', ' rural residence ', ' rural households ', ' rural dwelling ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' incentive program ', ' incentive-based program ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' baby boomer ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2019,806802,0.06624980533366984
"Diabetes and Prediabetes in Older Adults in ARIC ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults are at increased risk for diabetes but there is controversy regarding prognosis in prediabetes and diabetes, appropriate screening and treatment targets, and how best to reduce cardiovascular risk and prevent cognitive and physical impairment, especially in persons aged 70 years or higher. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study is an ongoing, community-based study of 15,792 participants originally recruited in 1987-1989. For over 25 years, ARIC investigators have conducted detailed assessments of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors including diabetes. At the most recent visit 5 (2011- 2013), the mean age of participants was 75 years, 23% were black, and 33% of participants had diagnosed diabetes. New visits in ARIC are planned from 2016 to 2019. This application is a request for funding of an approved ARIC ancillary study to add key diabetes-related measures to the upcoming visits. Aims: 1) Quantify the risk of incident prediabetes and diabetes in older black and white adults using multiple biomarkers; 2) Characterize the risk of clinical microvascular and macrovascular outcomes in older adults with diabetes, paying particular attention to differences in risk in older onset compared to middle-aged onset diabetes; 3) Characterize the association of prediabetes with risk of clinical and subclinical and clinical outcomes in older adults including physical and cognitive dysfunction; 4) Identify risk factors for hypoglycemia in older adults with diabetes and its associations with cardiovascular risk, mortality, and cognition. We will also evaluate the associations of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia with neuropathy, care practices, diabetes awareness and treatment satisfaction. Design and Methods: We will collect biospecimens from over 4,000 ARIC participants at the upcoming visits and conduct measurements of standard and nontraditional biomarkers of hyperglycemia, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. We will also conduct new assessments of hypoglycemia, neuropathy, preventive care practices, and diabetes treatment satisfaction. The proposed assessments will add over 5 years of additional follow-up (from visit 5) and will take advantage of ongoing surveillance for all hospitalizations, adjudicatin of cardiovascular and other events, and linkage to Medicare data. Significance: This competing renewal is designed to address long-standing controversies in the field and inform our understanding of the burden and clinical implications of prediabetes and diabetes in older adults. We will shed light on prognosis in heterogeneous glycemic subgroups and the performance of different markers of hyperglycemia. The data generated will provide evidence to assist clinicians in formulating more specific recommendations regarding testing, prognosis, and race- and age-related differences in risk associated with diabetes in older age. Results of this study will have direct relevance to clinical practice and inform strategies for the management of diabetes in older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetes is common in older adults but there are major uncertainty regarding how to best identify, treat, and manage diabetes in this population. This study will address major controversies in the field regarding the health effects of elevated glucose in older adults.

"The University of Florida Jacksonville Aging Studies Center (JAX-ASCENT) Summary Older adults of racial minorities and low socioeconomic (SES) status represent particularly high risk populations who are underserved and are significantly underrepresented in clinical research. This has led to a gap in knowledge regarding the appropriate and/or optimal prevention and treatment approaches for this high risk group. Within the state of Florida, the city of Jacksonville (JAX) has a high proportion of minority and low SES individuals. By expanding existing research collaborations on both aging and health disparities at its JAX site, the University of Florida (UF) has a unique opportunity to conduct important research that can reduce this knowledge gap. These existing relationships include partnership in conducting multi-center NIH-funded clinical trials, along with several community outreach efforts both at UF Gainesville (GNV) and JAX. However, there is currently no cohesive, organized resource to integrate these important research collaborations in aging and health disparities at UF-JAX. At the UF GNV campus, we have a strong clinical translational research infrastructure with the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center, Clinical Translational Science Institute and Disparities Research. In JAX, UF has a large health care facility in a densely populated minority and low SES area, but limited research infrastructure focused on aging research. To fully actualize the potential of this remarkable resource, we propose to develop a dedicated center for aging research focused on racial minorities and low SES older adults. This state-of-the-art clinical translational research facility for multidisciplinary research Jacksonville Aging Studies CENTer (JAX-ASCENT) will closely partner with the UF GNV campus and capitalize on our expertise and resources. Additionally, JAX-ASCENT will create an integrative physical and intellectual environment in which trainees at all levels and scientists from diverse disciplines can interact and conduct clinical and behavioral translational research on aging and independence of older adults. This focus will be pursued using an interdisciplinary approach that traverses a broad spectrum of biomedical investigation, including clinical research, behavioral sciences, social sciences, epidemiology, biostatistics, and health services, while implementing rigor and transparency in research. We will develop and partner regarding expertise on clinical trials, recruitment, adherence, retention, assessment of geriatric outcomes, biomarkers, and behavioral studies all focused and tailored on research in urban minorities and low SES older adults. We will apply a conceptual/logic model of community-based participatory research partnerships to improve community involvement and health outcomes, and to build a research participants registry. We will develop the physical and human infrastructure, mentor junior faculty towards leadership roles, and have JAX-ASCENT become self-sustaining. JAX-ASCENT will expand knowledge in clinical translational research in largely understudied populations and both enlarge and enrich the diversity of research in older minority populations, clinical effectiveness, outcomes, and community engagement programs at UF. Narrative With the development of JAX-ASCENT, we will provide resources and personnel (including NIH funded investigators) to support the development and implementation of behavioral, nutritional, and pharmacologic clinical trials, and observational studies of social determinants of health contributing to chronic diseases and functional decline in underserved, minority and low SES older adults. The JAX-ASCENT will fill a critical gap in knowledge regarding the translation and dissemination of research from efficacy studies to underserved, minority older adults who are at high risk of

"The National Health and Aging Trends Study Project Summary The purpose of this application is to extend and enhance the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a national platform for studying late life disability trends and trajectories. The overall aims of NHATS are to 1) promote scientific inquiry into late-life disability trends and dynamics, their antecedents and correlates, and disparities therein and (2) to advance study of the social and economic consequences of late-life disability for individuals, families, and society. To achieve these aims in the next five-year cycle, we will continue the unique key design features of NHATS including collecting data annually and in person from a nationally representative sample of older adults (sampled from the Medicare enrollment file) in 2019-2023 (Rounds 9-13). We will also add several innovative enhancements focused on objective measures of cognitive and sensory capacity and physical activity. Extending NHATS in this way will allow important scientific questions to be addressed concerning both shorter and longer-term in-depth trends in components of the disability process, as well as the dynamics of disability onset, progression and recovery. Specifically, in the next cycle NHATS will 1) Continue collection of the enhanced disability protocol and supplemental questions on disability antecedents and consequences including subjective and economic wellbeing, living and care arrangements, and quality of end of life; and replenish the sample in Round 10 (2020) in order to maintain NHATS' ability to produce 5-year age estimates (up to 90+) and Black-White comparisons; 2) Enrich and expand measurement in the NHATS' annual disability protocol including development and implementation of a) a new iPad-based protocol to enhance measures of cognitive and sensory capacity; and b) a panel substudy of physical activity using accelerometry; and 3) Document and disseminate NHATS data, make available linked claims files and new policy-relevant linkages, and provide new training opportunities to the growing NHATS user community. These aims will allow NHATS to achieve its overarching goal of providing a platform for scientific inquiry to guide efforts to reduce disability, maximize functioning, and enhance older adults' quality of life.

"Growing Older Staying Strong: A social ecological and intergenerational approach to promote walking for exercise among American Indian and Alaska Native older adults Project Abstract  Physical inactivity is an ongoing public health challenge in the U.S., especially among ethnic minorities, and is related to four leading causes of death: heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) older adults (OAs) are among the least physically active ethnic minority groups and experience pronounced health disparities. Recent attempts to increase physical activity (PA) among OAs have emphasized walking as a key therapeutic modality based on its health benefits, and intergenerational programs have shown promising results to increase walking among diverse OAs. However, little is known about walking among rural AIAN OAs, and although intergenerational interaction is a valued social practice among AIAN communities, research to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of this strategy to promote OA health is absent from the literature. This mentored research project is aligned with best practices for research with AIAN populations. A participatory research approach will be used to identify key ecologic and life course influences on walking among rural AIAN OAs, and to evaluate the acceptability of an intergenerational intervention to increase routine PA. This project will build on an ongoing, NIH-funded development award under the AIAN Clinical and Translational Research Program (U54GM115371) which establishes PA research infrastructure in rural AIAN communities. Aim 1 features qualitative interviews with AIAN OAs (n=20) to advance knowledge on ecologic and life course influences on walking behavior. This data will provide critical information for the development of meaningful and targeted behavioral interventions among this population. Aim 1 will also inform Aim 2 in the adaptation and development of a culturally responsive intergenerational walking intervention. This is a non-controlled, multi-dose intervention (4-weeks, 30-minute sessions 1x/week) to evaluate acceptability and feasibility of intervention content and methods, featuring paired intergenerational walking and dialogue (n=10 AIAN OAs, n=10 AIAN youth). Outcome measures include acceptability, feasibility, and routine PA among the OA participants. Post-test focus groups (one for OA participants, one for youth) will provide in-depth information on intervention evaluation and improvement for future testing. The candidate’s research experience combined with the proposed high-quality mentoring, training, and research project will extend her knowledge and skills in mixed methods and health disparities research. It will ensure the achievement of her short-term goal of attaining the knowledge and skills of the scientific process to conduct ethical, high-impact research using CBPR and mixed methods in the fields of gerontology and implementation science. The trainee’s long-term goal is to become an independent, externally funded researcher with a program of inquiry aimed at developing and implementing sustainable interventions to promote health equity among AIAN populations. Results from the proposed research project will inform future efforts to prevent disease and disability, and best practices for public health research in partnership with AIAN communities. Project Narrative This study will inform future physical activity interventions for rural American Indian and Alaska Native older adults. This population experiences disproportionately high rates of chronic disease and disability compared with other racial/ethnic groups, and reports among the lowest physical activity levels. Results will support culturally responsive, theory-driven strategies to prevent chronic disease and disability, reduce health disparities, and improve wellbeing.",Growing Older Staying Strong: A social ecological and intergenerational approach to promote walking for exercise among American Indian and Alaska Native older adults,9991318,F31AG064828,"['Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Exercise ', ' Fishes ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Plants ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Social Values ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Walking ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Rural ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' experience ', ' intergenerational ', ' physical model ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' volunteer ', ' native youth ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' implementation science ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' data format ', ' health equity ', ' public health research ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' physical activity intervention ', ' exercise intervention ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' walking intervention ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translational research program ', ' rural Americans ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Attention ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA,F31,2020,14484,0.02379526905267289
"The University of Florida Jacksonville Aging Studies Center (JAX-ASCENT) Summary Older adults of racial minorities and low socioeconomic (SES) status represent particularly high risk populations who are underserved and are significantly underrepresented in clinical research. This has led to a gap in knowledge regarding the appropriate and/or optimal prevention and treatment approaches for this high risk group. Within the state of Florida, the city of Jacksonville (JAX) has a high proportion of minority and low SES individuals. By expanding existing research collaborations on both aging and health disparities at its JAX site, the University of Florida (UF) has a unique opportunity to conduct important research that can reduce this knowledge gap. These existing relationships include partnership in conducting multi-center NIH-funded clinical trials, along with several community outreach efforts both at UF Gainesville (GNV) and JAX. However, there is currently no cohesive, organized resource to integrate these important research collaborations in aging and health disparities at UF-JAX. At the UF GNV campus, we have a strong clinical translational research infrastructure with the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center, Clinical Translational Science Institute and Disparities Research. In JAX, UF has a large health care facility in a densely populated minority and low SES area, but limited research infrastructure focused on aging research. To fully actualize the potential of this remarkable resource, we propose to develop a dedicated center for aging research focused on racial minorities and low SES older adults. This state-of-the-art clinical translational research facility for multidisciplinary research Jacksonville Aging Studies CENTer (JAX-ASCENT) will closely partner with the UF GNV campus and capitalize on our expertise and resources. Additionally, JAX-ASCENT will create an integrative physical and intellectual environment in which trainees at all levels and scientists from diverse disciplines can interact and conduct clinical and behavioral translational research on aging and independence of older adults. This focus will be pursued using an interdisciplinary approach that traverses a broad spectrum of biomedical investigation, including clinical research, behavioral sciences, social sciences, epidemiology, biostatistics, and health services, while implementing rigor and transparency in research. We will develop and partner regarding expertise on clinical trials, recruitment, adherence, retention, assessment of geriatric outcomes, biomarkers, and behavioral studies all focused and tailored on research in urban minorities and low SES older adults. We will apply a conceptual/logic model of community-based participatory research partnerships to improve community involvement and health outcomes, and to build a research participants registry. We will develop the physical and human infrastructure, mentor junior faculty towards leadership roles, and have JAX-ASCENT become self-sustaining. JAX-ASCENT will expand knowledge in clinical translational research in largely understudied populations and both enlarge and enrich the diversity of research in older minority populations, clinical effectiveness, outcomes, and community engagement programs at UF. Narrative With the development of JAX-ASCENT, we will provide resources and personnel (including NIH funded investigators) to support the development and implementation of behavioral, nutritional, and pharmacologic clinical trials, and observational studies of social determinants of health contributing to chronic diseases and functional decline in underserved, minority and low SES older adults. The JAX-ASCENT will fill a critical gap in knowledge regarding the translation and dissemination of research from efficacy studies to underserved, minority older adults who are at high risk of

"Finding Solutions for Disparities Associated with Star Ratings Established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Star Ratings system for Medicare Parts C&D (Star Ratings, hereafter) is a health plan quality reporting system with associated bonus payments and enrollment incentives for health plans since 2012. Researchers have reported the disparity implications of Star Ratings: e.g., racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to be excluded from measure calculation for diabetes adherence than non-Hispanic whites, thus minorities may be more likely to be excluded from quality improvement initiations for this measure, potentially worsening disparities in health. A critical barrier for resolving such disparities is that comprehensive policy recommendation related to effects of Star Ratings on racial/ethnic disparities is not available. The goals of this project are to ensure that Star Ratings include a set of measures that address disparities in measure calculation, and to evaluate the effects of Star Ratings bonus payments on reducing racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization. Our strategies are to (1) add to Star Ratings medication utilization measures selected from Pharmacy Quality Alliance measure concept inventory (PMCI), and other commonly used medication utilization (CUMU) measures (Star Plus, hereafter), and (2) compare racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization before and after the implementation of bonus payments, and between counties with “double bonuses” and those with regular bonuses. A project focusing on only medication utilization measures in Star Ratings is warranted because these measures account for a high percentage in Star Ratings scores (45% in Part D in 2013) and their correlation with other measures is only moderate. Bonus payments are associated with improved plan benefit structure, which may reduce racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization. In the prior grant period we found that selecting appropriate medication utilization measures may resolve racial/ethnic disparities associated with a Medicare Part D policy. Our objective of this continuation project is to conduct an analysis of Medicare Parts A/B/D data (2010-2015), linked to Area Health Resources Files, Orange Book Data Files, and CMS data on double/regular-bonus counties. We will also conduct disease-specific analysis. Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that using the medication utilization measures in current Star Ratings negatively affects the health of racial/ethnic minorities. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that using Star Plus can lead to a reduction in racial/ethnic disparities associated with Star Ratings. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that the Star Ratings bonus payments are associated with reduction in racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization. Our expected outcome is to provide policy recommendations to resolve important disparity issues in Star Ratings among diverse older adults. Impact: This project will help to align disparity reduction goals with rapidly-proliferating pay-for-performance and public-reporting initiatives. This project is responsive to the National Institute on Aging's mission-driven strategic goal to “understand health disparities and develop strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations.” The goals of this project are to evaluate effects of Medicare Parts C&D Star Ratings (Star Ratings, hereafter) bonus payments on racial and ethnic disparities and ensure that Star Ratings include a set of measures that address the disparities in measure calculation.

Our project will (1) provide the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services with information needed to align disparity reduction goals with rapidly-proliferating pay-for-performance and public-reporting initiatives; and (2) provide the National Institute on Aging with support to achieve its strategic goal of “understanding health disparities and develop strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations.”",Finding Solutions for Disparities Associated with Star Ratings,9978562,R01AG049696,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Books ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incentives ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Medicare Part A ', ' Medicare Hospital Insurance Program ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Data Files ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Quality Indicator ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' Stretching ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Medicare Choice ', ' Medicare Plus Choice ', ' Medicare Part C ', ' Structure ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Oranges ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Proliferating ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Concept Inventory ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' health plans ', ' health plan ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2020,269040,0.021554965263151562
"COVID-19 Supplement to LitCog IV: Health Literacy and Cognitive Function Among Older Adults We are seeking a supplement to our ongoing study (‘LitCog’; R01AG030611) in order to conduct two parallel, complementary investigations of the longer-term impact of COVID-19 on older adults’ lifestyle behaviors, psychological & physical function, socioeconomic circumstances, healthcare use, access & adherence to treatment, and health outcomes. First, we will extend our current inquiries to now determine whether LitCog participants with cognitive impairment are experiencing greater challenges in accessing care and managing personal health due to COVID-19 compared to cognitively ‘normal’ adults. Such a natural experiment is possible with LitCog; since 2007 we have tracked declines in cognition, as well as onset of cognitive impairment, and the resulting impact on self-management of chronic conditions among diverse, community dwelling, older adults. We will leverage our recent renewal award, with data capture from active patients (N=776), involved caregivers (N=100), electronic health (EHR) and pharmacy records, and add 5 telephone interviews conducted every 4 months to address the following primary aim: Aim 1 Investigate whether poorer cognitive function or MCI prior to the COVID-19 outbreak is  associated with inadequate use of healthcare services and/or poorer health status. Second, we will also extend our LitCog-linked, Chicago COVID-19 Comorbidities (C3) cohort study. In March 2020, as cases of COVID-19 were emerging in Chicago, our team rapidly responded by launching a survey to understand how older adults with chronic conditions, at greater risk for COVID-19 complications, were responding and taking action (or not) to prevent infection and disease spread. LitCog participants (n=153), as well as patients enrolled in four other active studies (N=673) with uniform data collection for a large set of patient factors and similar access to EHR and pharmacy records were recruited. Interviews were conducted during Chicago’s COVID-19 outbreak phase (March 13-20), rapid acceleration phase (March 27-April 3), and apex phase (May 1-19). Our findings revealed many high risk adults lacked critical knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms and ways to prevent harm, did not feel susceptible to the virus, felt unprepared for the outbreak, were not social distancing or ensuring they had adequate supplies of prescribed medications. Disparities were revealed; black adults, those living below poverty level, with low health literacy and poorer cognition were less prepared. Moving forward, the C3 cohort will also be followed as the LitCog cohort in Aim 1, allowing us to combine both cohorts and more directly investigate the longer-term impact of stress due to COVID-19 on the health and behaviors of adults with chronic conditions. Our secondary aim is to: Aim 2 Examine adults’ perceived stress from COVID-19 and its associations with lifestyle & self- management behaviors, healthcare use, patient-reported and clinical outcomes over time. COVID-19 presents a serious, direct threat to the health of older adults with comorbidities if infected, yet shelter- in-place orders, social distancing and changes to healthcare access may also pose formidable challenges to self-managing personal health. Our investigation will examine the impact of COVID-19 among older individuals with preexisting cognitive impairment who have remained independent and involved in their self-care, but now may be adversely affected by greater treatment burden (via limited or remote healthcare access), social isolation, and potentially unmet tangible support needs.",COVID-19 Supplement to LitCog IV: Health Literacy and Cognitive Function Among Older Adults,10185140,R01AG030611,"['Acceleration ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Chicago ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exhibits ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Poverty ', ' Records ', ' Risk ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Change ', ' Social modification ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social Distance ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Businesses ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' shelter ', ' shelter-housing ', ' Shelter facility ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Reaction ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Physical Function ', ' Visit ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' health literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' high risk ', ' treatment adherence ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' recruit ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health management ', ' patient portal ', ' remote care ', ' remote healthcare ', ' remote health care ', ' perceived stress ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' ']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,391278,0.07309742743523992
"electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS). ABSTRACT Recent meta-analyses have found that participation in the appropriate fall-prevention exercise program for an older adult reduces the risk of falls by 23% in relative terms, for an absolute reduction of 0.20 falls per person per year. Many guidelines, including the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), recommend that older adults at risk of falls are referred to appropriate fall-prevention exercise programs (USPSTF Level B). Despite this evidence, many older adults do not receive appropriate referrals and support for fall-prevention exercises, with one study finding that less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). Older people living in rural areas are more likely to fall but are less likely to participate in fall prevention programs. Advances in computing technology can help to identify older people at risk of falls and disseminate guidance about the most effective interventions using clinical decision support (CDS) systems. Patients can be supported in their exercise programs through a patient-focused App distributed through the PCP or through content on their patient portal. Well-implemented CDS that is integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) can support prescribing or recommending effective strategies and engaging patients in fall prevention decision-making thus integrating evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice. The long-term goal of our research program is to enhance the safety of community-based older adults by reducing falls through an effective patient-centered learning health system called eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS). With eSTEPS, an exercise algorithm will be integrated into the EHR which will trigger a Best Practice Alert (BPA) and Smart Set to provide actionable CDS within primary care clinic workflows and facilitate the use of CDS with patients to ensure evidence-based recommendations are tailored to patient preferences. The resulting fall prevention exercise care plan will be sent to the EHR as a note and to a patient-facing App for the patient to view after their visit. In this proposal we will use traditional fall risk screening and machine learning approaches to accurately identify older adults at risk for falls. We will then develop, CDS implemented into the electronic health record that helps primary care providers and older patients develop a tailored fall prevention exercise plan. We will conduct a cluster randomized control trial in urban and rural primary care clinics to test the efficacy of the eSTEPS CDS intervention. Development of the eSTEPS CDS within the widely adopted Epic EHR will support dissemination of evidence for older adults, with a focus on rural elders. NARRATIVE There is substantial evidence that conducting multifactorial fall risk assessments and developing personalized prevention plans in primary care settings can reduce falls, but many barriers exist to integrating this evidence into practice. The US Preventive Service Task Force recommends fall prevention exercises for community- dwelling adults who are at increased risk for falls, however less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). The goal of this project is to develop, test, and evaluate shareable, standards-based fall prevention clinical decision support, eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS) that can used by primary care providers to facilitate personalized activity and exercise prescriptions and reduce falls in at risk older adults.",electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS).,10049339,R61AG068926,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Exercise ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' falls ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' preventing falls ', ' Fall prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Guidelines ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Rural ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention program ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' fall risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Prevention Guidelines ', ' community safety ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' usability ', ' high risk ', ' control trial ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' clinical practice ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' individualized prevention ', ' clinically actionable ', ' exercise prescription ', ' fitness program ', ' exercise program ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smartphone Application ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' patient portal ', ' clinical decision support ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R61,2020,250020,0.12060133389756954
"Midwest Roybal Center for Health Promotion and Translation Abstract Overall Our proposed UIC Midwest Roybal Center for Health Promotion and Translation seeks to accelerate the translation of behavioral research theories into practical outcomes to improve the functioning and quality of life of older adults. Our work recognizes that interventions that target individuals take place in families, neighborhoods, and communities that are impacted by external factors that influence initiation and maintenance of behavior change. Our work is guided by the RE-AIM Framework to identify health promotion interventions that have the greatest potential for broad based public health impact. Our Center will support the design and testing of principle-driven, potent health promotion interventions that have strong promise of progressing through the NIH Stage Change Model. Our proposed renewal Center retains its current focus on designing interventions for older racial/ethnic minority adults and expands the focus of our health behavior interventions to include cognitive health. This renewal application targets four thematic areas of focus: physical activity promotion; enhancing mobility, defined broadly to include improved cognitive function gait, balance, and walking; harnessing technology to improve intervention scalability and fidelity; and incorporating mechanisms of action that will sustain behavior change. Our Management team, Senior Leaders and Principal Investigators of funded pilot projects will constitute the Center Research Faculty. The Management team and Senior Leaders have experience conducting research across all stages of the Stage Model and will work to transition promising pilots across the Stages as quickly as possible. The Pilot PIs will be responsible for completing all activities proposed in their projects, under the oversight of the Management Core. The Pilot Core will provide grant funding for up to two pilots per year, solicited from all departments across UIC and other University of Illinois campuses. The renewal Center Executive Committee is comprised of Senior Leaders and Chairs of multiple departments at UIC, all of which are critical to fulfilling the mission of the Center. The overall performance of the Center will be guided by a distinguished Advisory Committee that includes representatives from diverse academic, provider, funder, consumer, and media stakeholder groups. Finally, this renewal application incorporates for the first time a Multi-modal ADRD Imaging and Connectomics Core that will enable investigators to perform brain imaging, interpretation, and storage and provide access to uniform cognitive and physical activity measures.

"Enhancing ADRD Research in NHATS: Sampling design to expand representation of the Hispanic population Abstract The overarching aim of this supplement is to design and prepare a replenishment sample to the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) with a Hispanic `add-on' sample in order to meet the analytic aims of studying ADRD care needs and consequences in the Hispanic population. As the Hispanic population living in the United States grows and ages, understanding the epidemiology of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), including care needs and consequences as well as ADRD prevalence and trends, are high priority scientific aims. NHATS interviews a sample of over 8,000 older adults annually in order to (1) promote scientific inquiry into late-life disability trends and dynamics, their antecedents and correlates, and disparities therein and (2) to advance study of the social and economic consequences of late-life disability for individuals, families, and society. The NHATS sample is replenished periodically; the first replenishment was fielded in 2015 and a second replenishment is planned for 2021 (a one-year delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Because the NHATS sample is national in scope and is drawn from the Medicare enrollment file such that each enrollee has a known probability of selection, NHATS has the potential to provide important insights into ADRD for the Hispanic older population. Moreover, its supplemental National Study of Caregiving, which interviews family and unpaid caregivers of NHATS participants, could provide important insights into how Hispanic families' experiences differ when caring for an older relative with ADRD. The planned replenishment of NHATS in 2021 gives us the opportunity to design a sample that has expanded representation of the Hispanic population in NHATS by increasing the NHATS sample. The specific aims of this supplement are to: 1) Design a replenishment sample for NHATS that will include an add-on Hispanic supplement; and 2) Draw the NHATS replenishment sample, including Hispanic add-on, for fieldwork to begin in 2021, and document sampling activities in a technical paper. A future application will request funds to interview the add-on sample and caregivers generated by the sample. Narrative The purpose of this administrative supplement application is to design and draw a sample for the 2021 National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) replenishment that expands representation of the Hispanic population so as to allow analyses of older Hispanic persons with and without ADRD, and in comparison with persons of other race/ethnic groups, with regard to how disablement unfolds, patterns of care and consequences for families, and ADRD trends and trajectories.",Enhancing ADRD Research in NHATS: Sampling design to expand representation of the Hispanic population,10151716,U01AG032947,"['Participant ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Older Population ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' informant ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' dementia care ', ' dementia caregiving ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' Wellbeing trends ', ' Wellness trends ', ' well being trends ', ' Health trends ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Paper ', ' Parents ', ' Probability ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Societies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Investigation ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' ']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,240844,0.015300157856196062
"Understanding disparities in the adoption and use of assistive technology by older Hispanics Project Summary/Abstract The proportion of older Hispanics who have disabilities and are living independently in Puerto Rico is substantially higher than older adults from any other race and ethnicity living in the United States. Loss of function in old age eventually leads to institutionalization and early death. Use of assistive technology (AT) is an important strategy to manage disabilities, increase independence, and ensure the safety of older adults. Despite evidence that older Hispanics experience more functional disabilities throughout their later life, they are among the least likely to use and access AT devices. Barriers to AT use among people with a variety of disabilities have been studied, which include the cost of AT, lack of AT awareness/information, limited availability of providers, stigma, and lack of perceived need. However, it is unknown how gender inequalities among the multilevel factors that influence AT use could be reflected upon gender differences in the adoption and use of AT. The main objectives of the proposed study are to: 1) identify functional disabilities that can be mitigated by AT among community-living Hispanics, 65 years and older, with functional disabilities; 2) compare functional disability types (i.e., personal care activities, daily living activities, and functional mobility) between men and women; and 3) understand the multilevel factors (i.e., person, environment, technology, activities, access to and control over resources, bargaining positions, and gender norms) that result in barriers and facilitators to using AT. To meet these aims, this project interdisciplinary team of researchers will first collect and analyze data obtained from the administration of both the PROMIS® Physical Function Short Form and a socio-demographic questionnaire to 250 older Hispanics; then, follow with the collection and analysis of individual qualitative interviews (assisted by AT videos) from a sub-sample of 24 participants. Participants will be purposively recruited from a low-income community in Puerto Rico because they are the most likely to experience barriers to accessing health care and AT services. The researchers have incorporated a community-based organization and their community advisory board to collaborate in the implementation and interpretation of the results of this study. The expected outcome is to improve the understanding of gender differences in different types of disabilities as well as the differences in the barriers and facilitators for using different types of AT. The results of this mixed method study will lay the foundation for the subsequent design and testing of a culturally-competent, gender-sensitive intervention aimed at increasing AT device use by older Hispanics, thereby enhancing their daily function, quality of life, and opportunities for ageing in place. This goal supports the NINR mission to prevent disabilities and advance the health and quality of life of underserved minority populations. Narrative The proposed revised R21 research will contribute fundamental new knowledge about the factors that influence the adoption and use of assistive technologies (AT) among older Hispanics living in a low-income community to compensate for their disabilities in daily life activities and how these factors differ by gender. This new knowledge will serve to identify effective strategies that will be incorporated in a culturally-competent AT self-management intervention to promote the adoption and use of AT to increase older Hispanics function, quality of life, and opportunities for aging in place. This is directly aligned with the NINR mission to develop interventions to reduce disabilities among older people.",Understanding disparities in the adoption and use of assistive technology by older Hispanics,9986039,R21NR018039,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Esthetics ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Independent Living ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Interview ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tropical Medicine ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Physical Function ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' community living ', ' daily functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' loss of function ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' underserved minority ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender difference ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' recruit ', ' age in place ', ' aging in place ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,R21,2020,150000,0.08737851106675942
"Leveraging Implementation Science to Promote Behavior Change and Reduce Cancer Health Disparities among American Indian and Alaska Native Older Adults Project Summary American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) adults are more likely to develop cancer and die from it than white American adults, reflecting pronounced and persistent cancer health disparities (CHDs). Colorectal cancer (CRC) rates are disproportionately high among AIANs in the Northern Plains and Alaska regions; likewise, risk factors for CRC are also high, including non-modifiable factors such as increasing age and rurality, and proven modifiable risk factors such as physical inactivity, and obesity. A recent consensus report indicates strong evidence that physical activity (PA) lowers risk for colon cancer through systemic (i.e., metabolism, inflammation) and obesity reduction pathways. However, despite availability of efficacious behavioral interventions to increase PA among older adults, a critical gap exists between evidence generated and action taken to implement such interventions among AIAN older adults. This gap represents a missed opportunity to implement current evidence-based interventions (EBIs) in cancer prevention among high-risk populations experiencing pronounced CHDs. Implementation science concentrates on understanding and accelerating integration of such EBIs into public health practice settings to improve health and can be leveraged here to address this critical public health gap, thus addressing persistent CHDs and improving overall health among AIAN communities. This F99/K00 Predoctoral to Postdoctoral Fellow Transition Award application assists a promising trainee - Maja Pedersen, who has 15 years of experience in community-based behavioral interventions among rural AIAN communities in the Northern Plains and Alaska regions - to embark on a rigorous research and training program to confront this critical gap using best practices for intervention research with AIAN communities and current implementation science methods. Pedersen’s long-term goal is to become an independent investigator in designing and implementing PA interventions among underserved populations - including AIANs - to improve cancer-related health outcomes and reduce CHDs. Her short-term goals include gaining expertise in the use of multilevel intervention methods, dissemination and implementation science, cancer prevention and control among geriatric populations, experimental design, and intensive longitudinal methods. In collaboration with her multidisciplinary team of predoctoral mentors, she has developed a training plan to initiate these goals via coursework, workshops, scientific meetings, directed readings, and mentored research (F99 Phase). As she transitions into the postdoctoral phase, she will assemble a team of high-level, cancer-focused mentors to support her through continued mentored training with an explicit focus on cancer prevention and control. Her postdoctoral research (K00 Phase) executes the logical next steps in her research sequence on a trajectory toward a full-scale implementation and effectiveness trial as an independent scientist. Project Narrative The proposed research reduces modifiable risk factors to prevent colorectal cancer among American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) older adults, who experience pronounced cancer health disparities (CHDs). Results contribute to a growing field of implementation science to address CHDs and follows landmark efforts to align with ethical, strengths-based practices for public health research with AIAN communities. At completion of the proposed aims, the trainee will transition into early-career investigator stage equipped with the expertise, experience, and networks to successfully launch an independent research career focusing on behavioral interventions to reduce CHDs among diverse, geriatric populations.",Leveraging Implementation Science to Promote Behavior Change and Reduce Cancer Health Disparities among American Indian and Alaska Native Older Adults,10065245,F99CA253761,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Alaska ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Fellowship ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Training Programs ', ' Voice ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Walking ', ' base ', ' career ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' CRC prevention ', ' colo-rectal cancer prevention ', ' prevent colo-rectal cancer ', ' prevent colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Consensus ', ' Scientist ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Process ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' implementation trial ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' northern plains ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' pre-doc ', ' predoc ', ' predoctoral ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' implementation science ', ' public health priorities ', ' public health research ', ' Dislocations ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' physical activity intervention ', ' exercise intervention ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' rurality ', ' rural Americans ', ' colo-rectal cancer risk ', ' colorectal cancer risk ', ' colon cancer risk ', ' practice setting ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA,F99,2020,37543,0.007684804810193356
"The Epidemiology of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in Sexual and Gender Minority Older Adults: Identifying Risk and Protective Factors Abstract By 2030, there will be nearly six million sexual and gender minority (SGM) older adults aged 60 and older in the U.S. who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. Approximately 350,000 SGM older adults in the U.S. currently have Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), with projections nearing one million by 2030. Yet, almost nothing is known about the prevalence or risk of ADRD in SGM older adults without HIV/AIDS. This proposal will focus on the epidemiology and risk of ADRD in SGM older adults. The first aim of this proposal is to characterize the epidemiology and risk of ADRD in a population-based sample of SGM older adults and compare the prevalence and incidence of ADRD in SGM older adults to their heterosexual peers. The second aim will focus on identifying risk and protective factors for ADRD in SGM older adults, and to estimate the population attributable risk of depression and socioeconomic status (e.g., income and education) on ADRD. The third aim will involve primary data collection in a community-based sample of SGM older adults in order to investigate the relationship between risk and protective factors and cognition, including memory and executive function. This proposal incorporates several innovations that will allow me to evaluate the epidemiology and risk of cognitive impairment and ADRD in SGM older adults: 1) this will be the first study of the epidemiology and associated risk and protective factors for cognitive impairment and ADRD in SGM older adults; 2) it leverages the largest longitudinal dataset in the nation, Research Program for Genes Environment and Health (RPGEH), with data on the physical and psychosocial health of SGM older adults; and 3) it involves a novel investigation of factors that may be associated with memory and executive function impairment in SGM older adults. To successfully complete this research, I propose three training aims: 1) advanced statistical modeling of ADRD risk and protective factors; 2) epidemiology of SGM aging and health disparities; and 3) measurement and analysis of cognitive aging. This career development award ultimately will result in the submission of a R01 to develop a future multi-site epidemiological study of cognitive aging and ADRD in SGM older adults. Given that nothing is currently known about ADRD risk in this population, this work is necessary to promote early detection; to develop culturally relevant screenings and targeted preventative interventions to decrease ADRD risk in SGM older adults; and to improve the care and quality of life of this vulnerable and understudied population. Project Narrative Almost nothing is known about the epidemiology or risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in sexual and gender minority older adults (individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) without HIV/AIDS. Sexual and gender minority older adults experience greater health disparities than their heterosexual peers, including higher rates of depression, hypertension, and other risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia.

"Racial disparities in diabetes- and prediabetes-associated outcomes in older adults PROJECT SUMMARY Diabetes disproportionately affects older adults. Recent estimates from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) found over 25% of U.S. adults over the age of 65 are living with diabetes, with the prevalence in African Americans almost double that in Caucasians. As the general population continues to age, the societal health burden associated with dysglycemia, and the associated racial disparities, will only continue to increase. Little is understood about the impacts of aging on the progression and associated complications of dysglycemia and prior findings in middle-age adults may not generalize to the aging population. With the dearth of focused work on this age group, most guidelines on the diabetes care of older adults remain based on expert opinion. Better characterization of the racial disparities and interaction of aging with dysglycemia in this population is needed to inform responsible evidence-based clinical care. Our proposed aims focus on addressing the following knowledge gaps using the longitudinal data available from non-Hispanic black and white adults in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. 1. What are the racial disparities in the short-term clinical and subclinical outcomes of pre-diabetes and  diabetes in older adults? 2. How does diabetes awareness, care practice, and treatment satisfaction differ by race in older adults? 3. What is the association of treatment understanding and satisfaction with burden of chronic diabetes-related  complications? Do differences in these measures mediate the racial disparities in outcomes? We hypothesize that aging is a potential modifier of the physiologic impacts of hyperglycemia as well as the racial disparities in associated outcomes, contributing to differential risk profiles in this age group. With the complexities of aging, older adults present unique clinical challenges that require individualization of treatment. However, lack of standardized approaches may further exacerbate racial disparities. Disparities in disease awareness, care patterns, and treatment satisfaction could have implications for the severity of both clinical and subclinical complications. Our proposed work will supply insight into these open questions and provide the fellowship applicant with a rigorous mentored training in epidemiologic and biostatistical skills needed for her future career goals of becoming an academic physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to characterize racial disparities in the clinical implications of dysglycemia, diabetes understanding, care practices, and treatment satisfaction in older adults. Findings from these analyses will contribute to the critical need for evidence to guide clinical diabetes care of patients in this age group. The proposed body of work will provide the fellowship applicant, Ms. Olive Tang, with mentored training in rigorous epidemiological and biostatistical methods, including survival analyses in a longitudinal prospective cohort study.",Racial disparities in diabetes- and prediabetes-associated outcomes in older adults,9995475,F30DK120160,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Albumins ', ' Awareness ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complication ', ' Creatinine ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Mentors ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Diseases ', ' PNS Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nerve Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Disorders ', ' Peripheral Neuropathy ', ' Physicians ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Standardization ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Troponin ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' insight ', ' satisfaction ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Olives ', ' Olives -

"Recruiting & Retaining Older African Americans into Research (ROAR) ABSTRACT The Recruiting and Retaining Older African Americans into Research (ROAR) project is designed to develop and disseminate effective strategies to recruit, retain, and promote participation in health-related research among African American older adults. This project builds upon 20 years of successful efforts to engage and provide health promotion programming for older adult community members in Detroit, MI through the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR), a collaborative partnership between The University of Michigan, Wayne State University, and most recently, Michigan State University. At the center of the current MCUAAAR research recruitment infrastructure is a Community Advisory Board of African American older adults, housed at MCUAAAR's Healthier Black Elders Center in Detroit, MI. This advisory board meets regularly to review and provide approval for research applications from investigators who want to sample from a Participant Research Registry of 1400 older African Americans in Detroit who have agreed to be contacted to participate in social science research. The advisory board also provides feedback on MCUAAAR community programming and receives instruction on how to evaluate and interpret social science research. The MCUAAAR team, led by Dr. James Jackson and Dr. Jamie Mitchell, will utilize community-based participatory approaches to significantly expand the recruitment and retention capabilities of the current infrastructure by achieving the following three aims with corresponding methods and outcomes. First, we will engage local community partners in order to recruit, train and establish a research advisory board of African American older adults in Flint, Michigan in service of a future Flint Participant Research Registry. Establishing a research advisory board of African American older adults in Flint, Michigan with the support of new and existing community partnerships, will provide the community-driven infrastructure for building a future research registry of older adults in Flint that investigators can apply to utilize similar to the existing Detroit registry. Next, we will gain input from both the existing Detroit and new Flint community advisory boards and other stakeholders on the technological design, content and user interface, resources for male recruitment, and launch of an interactive recruitment website. This website will feature educational resources for the public on research participation, information on how to join the registries, features of NIH-relevant research utilizing the registries, a section targeting men's research recruitment, and administrative tools and best practices for researchers working with minority older adults. Finally, we will evaluate the reach, usability, and acceptability of the website with a range of older African Americans and academic and clinical researchers in three cities in order to demonstrate the strategy's effectiveness with specific populations and how to establishing a new community- based registry and corresponding resources can be adapted for other settings and geographical areas.

"GAPcare II: The Geriatric Acute & Post-acute Care Coordination Program for Fall Prevention in the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY Before the COVID-19 pandemic, only 4% of older adults used telehealth, but uptake has been rapid since the start of social distancing. However, little is known about physicians’ experiences implementing telehealth or the extent of uptake among US physicians. There is a critical need to disseminate useful telehealth strategies that physicians have employed to treat older adults, especially those with disabilities (e.g. visual, hearing, mobility, cognitive), living in facilities, with limited digital know-how or access to technology. Through in- depth interviews with geriatricians, primary care, and emergency physicians, who are the first point of contact during COVID-19, and a subsequent national survey, we propose revealing these strategies, understanding the scope of telehealth uptake nationally, and disseminating our insights which could inform healthcare delivery transformation for older adults. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that physicians have made important discoveries about telehealth since the start of COVID-19 and disseminating lessons learned will ensure that older adult needs are considered as care is rapidly shifted to the virtual environment. Without attention to equity and leveraging insights of physicians that care for older adults, the “digital divide” will cause already existing inequities in medical care to further increase at the expense of older adults. Identifying where telehealth has not yet been implemented can be helpful to focus awareness efforts. Dr. Goldberg will pursue the following two specific aims: (1) conduct semi-structured telephone interviews (n=36-54) with geriatricians, primary care and emergency physicians (n=12-18 each), stratified by practice setting (metro/suburban/rural (n=12-18 each)) and type (academic/community (n=18-27 each)) to explore telehealth services provided/abandoned, modes of use, facilitators/barriers, practical considerations, and experiences with providing care remotely to older adults. We will solicit physicians on social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook), and via specialty society listserves. Findings will inform item generation, reduction, and question content for the survey; (2) conduct a web-based national survey of geriatricians, primary care and emergency physicians (n=1,600, 1% of each specialty) using the American Medical Association’s Physician Masterfile to estimate the scope of telehealth use, methods of delivery, barriers/challenges to adoption, and lessons learned delivering care to older adults. This contribution is expected to be significant because the choices physicians make in adapting their clinical practice to the remote environment - what modes to use, how to train and assess patients - are likely to dictate if older adults’ needs and challenges are considered as the future of healthcare delivery takes shape. Dr. Goldberg’s overarching aims are to ensure older adults receive medical care in the most suitable setting by enhancing the knowledge and training physicians receive in telehealth to meet the unique needs of their patients during and after the pandemic. The completion of these aims will provide Dr. Goldberg with critical pilot data for a telehealth training RCT which will be submitted as a R01 to the NIA. PROJECT NARRATIVE The public health significance of this K76 Supplement request is immense as it proposes an in-depth investigation of telehealth practices since the start of COVID-19 and a national survey to estimate the scope of telehealth uptake which addresses the Federal Task Force report “Emergency Technologies to Support an Aging Population” by ensuring that access to healthcare is preserved for older adults as medical care shifts to telehealth rapidly – and potentially permanently – in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This project is directly responsive to the NIA’s “Strategic Directions for Research, 2020-2025”, Goal C: Develop effective interventions to maintain health, well-being, and function and prevent or reduce the burden of age-related disease, disorders, and disabilities. Dr. Goldberg’s successful completion of this study will provide pilot data to support the development and testing of a telehealth training intervention that will help clinicians tailor remote care practices to the unique cognitive, sensory, and mobility needs of older persons, thereby promoting health, longevity, and independence.",GAPcare II: The Geriatric Acute & Post-acute Care Coordination Program for Fall Prevention in the Emergency Department,10170870,K76AG059983,"['Home Blood Pressure Monitoring ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' effective intervention ', ' clinical practice ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' social media ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' web portal ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' smartwatch ', ' smart watch ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' practice setting ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' remote care ', ' remote healthcare ', ' remote health care ', ' preservation ', ' Facebook ', ' Twitter ', ' virtual environment ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' acute care ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' Adoption ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' American Medical Association ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hearing ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Learning ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest US ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Social Distance ', ' Societies ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' preventing falls ', ' Fall prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' suburban ', ' suburbia ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Rural ', ' uptake ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Sensory ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' ']",NIA,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K76,2020,66285,0.14427538153162303
"Educational Attainment, Geography, and U.S. Adult Mortality Risk PROJECT SUMMARY Educational attainment is one of the strongest social determinants of U.S. adult mortality risk. Studies to explain the education-mortality association have focused more on the individual-level “proximal” mechanisms (e.g., smoking) than identifying the contextual conditions that undergird the association. This major knowledge gap has consequences for science and public policy; it limits the discovery of explanations and interventions. The gap may reflect the dominant view in U.S. research that education is a personal resource. Accordingly, U.S. studies of the education-mortality association have emphasized agentic mechanisms: individuals with more education are thought to coalesce healthy lifestyles, seek out medical knowledge, avoid financial hardship, and so on. While agentic explanations are important, they ignore the fact that individuals are embedded in social and political contexts that influence the extent to which education matters for mortality. Despite numerous studies showing this to be the case in Europe, there has been scant research in the U.S. The goal of this study is to examine how and why the education-mortality association varies across U.S. states. Decisions made by governors and state legislatures affect employment, housing, transportation, social integration, healthy lifestyles, and numerous other social determinants of mortality. These state contexts have grown increasingly disparate through decades of deregulation and devolution. These trends may explain why, by the end of the 20th century, the range in life expectancy at age 50 across U.S. states exceeded the range across comparable high-income countries, and ½ of the variation in life expectancy across U.S. counties was attributable to the state within which they are located. This study addresses three questions: (1) How does the education-mortality association vary across states and over time?, (2) How does the variation in the education- mortality association across states and over time reflect state policies, resources, and opportunity structures?, and (3) What are the individual pathways through which state policies, resources, and opportunity structures shape the education-mortality association? The central hypothesis is that the association differs markedly across states, and that it is weakest in states with progressive economic policies, robust employment opportunities, and high social cohesion. The study will use data on adults aged 45-89 years in the restricted 1985-2011 National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality File. Using discrete-time survival models, it will examine all-cause and cause-specific mortality. All analyses will be stratified by gender, age group, and time period. Analyses account for interstate migration and county-level mortality variation to better isolate the importance of state contexts. Expected outcomes of this study include: (a) estimates of the education-mortality association by state, and (b) insights into policies and strategies that states might employ to reduce mortality among their populations. The long-term goal is to reduce adult mortality, especially among vulnerable groups. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will: (a) contribute to fundamental knowledge about how and why the magnitude of socioeconomic inequalities in adult mortality differ across U.S. states, and (b) identify policies and strategies that states might implement to reduce these inequalities and improve older adult longevity. The proposed research is relevant to several priorities of NIA, including its priority to reduce health disparities and eliminate health inequities among older adults.","Educational Attainment, Geography, and U.S. Adult Mortality Risk",9967938,R01AG055481,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decentralization ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Europe ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Housing ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Medicaid ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Politics ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Sales ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Taxation ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Transportation ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Mortality Determinants ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Economic Policy ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Outcome Study ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' social integration ', ' authority ', ' Cigarette ', ' Structure ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Science Policy ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' tobacco control ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' migration ', ' effective intervention ', ' healthy life-style ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' local economy ', ' discrete time ', ' education research ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' social cohesion ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NIA,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,279058,0.06119802754802445
"University of Florida Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the University of Florida Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) is twofold: 1) to optimize older persons' physical performance and mobility through interdisciplinary approaches; and 2) to train new investigators in aging and disability research while developing their leadership qualities. Our goal is to enhance late-life health and independence, with a special focus on mobility. To accomplish our mission, our strategy is to attract studies and inventive investigators from diverse behavioral, clinical, basic, and technological science disciplines with a common research focus: “mobility and prevention of disability.” Traversing the entire spectrum of biomedical investigation, including molecular biology, animal studies, clinical research, behavioral sciences, epidemiology, and engineering, our research effort addresses the OAIC's general goal: to increase scientific knowledge that leads to better ways to maintain or restore independence of older people. Our research objectives are to: 1) assess, using translational research (among diverse disciplines), the biological, co-morbid, psychosocial, behavioral, and other factors that contribute to physical function decline, loss of mobility, and progression toward disability; and 2) develop and reliably test, in clinical and preclinical studies, interventions that target mobility to prevent, delay, or recover the age-related declines in physical function. Our educational objective is to train future leaders in clinical translational research on aging. To meet these objectives the proposed OAIC trains Junior Scholars and supports investigators, resources, services, external studies, development projects, and pilot/exploratory studies through seven integrated cores:  • Leadership and Administrative Core;  • Research Education Core;  • Pilot/Exploratory Studies Core;  • Clinical Research Core;  • Metabolism and Translational Science Core;  • Biostatistics Core; and  • Data Science and Applied Technology Core.  A relevant strength of the proposed OAIC is the concerted action of the interdisciplinary cores, projects, and investigators who address one common research focus spanning the entire spectrum of biomedical investigation. Narrative Better knowledge of the factors leading to optimizing mobility and developing efficacious and effective interventions to avert disability will have a major impact on practicing evidence-based geriatric medicine and public health.",University of Florida Claude D.

"Equity and Economic Effects of MTM Services Drug-related morbidity and mortality cost the United States over $177.4 billion annually and are especially daunting among the elderly. To improve pharmacotherapy outcomes and reduce costs, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) established medication management therapy (MTM) programs as part of the Medicare prescription drug benefits (Part D) in 2006. Unfortunately, MTM enrollment has fallen below CMS targets mainly due to issues in MTM program design. Further, based on our previous policy scenario analysis, primarily supported by an NIA R01, MTM eligibility criteria may be too restrictive for racial/ethnic minorities and may perpetuate racial/ethnic disparities in health outcomes, because MTM eligibility is based on utilization of medications, which minorities tend to use less. CMS attempted to relax MTM eligibility thresholds, citing our research, but potential disparities remain with the utilization-based eligibility criteria. A critical barrier to effective MTM reform is the lack of stronger information about the actual effects of MTM on minorities' outcomes, utilization of MTM by minorities, and the cost-effectiveness of MTM. We will fill this knowledge gap through our proposed research with newly available MTM data. Our long-term goal is to improve the health status of older adults among diverse populations by improving medication utilization and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization and health outcomes. We will analyze Medicare Parts A/B/D data (2015- 2016), linked to Area Health Resources Files. Our expected outcomes include new information on: (1) effects of MTM on racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization, utilization/costs of health services, and mortality; (2) measures of MTM utilization, such as MTM delivery methods, that exhibit disparity patterns; and (3) cost- effectiveness of MTM from the perspectives of Medicare and health system. We will measure medication utilization using evidence-based statin prescribing and other measures primarily developed by Pharmacy Quality Alliance and adopted by Star Ratings, a health-plan-quality evaluation system tied to CMS bonus payments to Part D plans. Utilization/costs of services include those of physician visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations (e.g., hospitalizations originating from ambulatory care sensitive conditions). We will apply multivariate regression models, a difference-in-difference strategy and negative benefit regression models using frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that MTM programs have reduced racial/ethnic disparities in quality of medication utilization, and health services utilization and costs. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics receive fewer and delayed MTM services than Whites. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that MTM is a cost-effective program. Impact: Our results will provide much- needed empirical evidence to guide MTM policy-making by CMS, and assist the NIA/NIH in its strategic goals of informing “policy decisions” and “understand(ing) health disparities and develop(ing) strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations.” Our long-term goal is to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations by improving medication utilization and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization and health outcomes.

"DO TELL - Digitized Stories to Bridge the Gap Between Patient and Provider Perceptions of Disease Self-Management Challenges Project Summary Disparities in chronic condition self-management (CCSM) experienced by older African Americans stem, to a significant degree, from their complex challenges in CCSM and physicians' poor understanding of and/or empathy for those challenges. For physicians to assist older African Americans to optimize CCSM, they must have at least a better understanding of the complex and unique CCSM challenges faced by their patients. Patients' stories have been used increasingly to promote knowledge sharing, understanding, and reflective listening across diverse groups, as well as to foster successful behavior change among CCSM patients. However, patients' stories have not yet been used to promote physicians' understanding of the life circumstances of older African American patients who struggle with CCSM. To develop an effective story approach for large-scale use, however, we first need to better understand the experience of CCSM among older African Americans, how that experience can be translated into stories for medical education, and how such stories work or not to enhance physician understanding and improve care. Those steps are necessary to improve CCSM practice with older African American patients. The long-term goals of the proposed research are to (1) address these gaps in knowledge by creating and curating a library of validated digital CCSM stories of older African Americans that effectively enhance physicians' understanding and care interactions; and (2) sustain engagement in related research at the intersection of CCSM and minority aging by graduate and undergraduate occupational therapy students and faculty. The specific aims of the proposed R15 study are to (1) collect and analyze personal stories from older African Americans and transform them into digital narratives (videos) that reflect the most important CCSM challenges they face, and to (2) evaluate the concordance between story content and medical students' understanding of the stories. To address Aim 1 we will conduct focus groups (n = 6, 5-8 participants each) to collect older African Americans' narrative descriptions of CCSM challenges. We will analyze those narrative data to determine their core dimensions and rhetorical structure. That narrative content and structure will be validated by an expert panel (including older African Americans) and then translated into brief video stories enacted by older African Americans. To achieve Aim 2, we will use questionnaires and cognitive interviews with medical students (after video viewing) to determine their understanding of story content as well as factors that may explain variations in understanding. Aim 2 analysis will focus on examining rates of concordance between story and student understanding, and correlations between concordance and variables that could account for its variation, such as story dimensions, student ethnicity/race, and empathy scores. Open-ended responses on the questionnaire and cognitive interview data will be analyzed to further understand patterns in medical student understanding and their potential causes. Project Narrative Older African Americans have higher rates of chronic health conditions and face substantive challenges with chronic condition self-management (CCSM), yet those challenges are poorly understood by their physicians. To bridge this gap in understanding and improve care and health outcomes for older African Americans, this project will collect their stories of CCSM, extract the most important messages of those stories, and develop brief videos communicating those messages. We will then examine the ability of medical students to understand those messages and other factors that might explain misunderstanding in particular.",DO TELL - Digitized Stories to Bridge the Gap Between Patient and Provider Perceptions of Disease Self-Management Challenges,9880070,R15AG063087,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Medical Education ', ' Empathy ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' workplace exposure ', ' Occupational Therapy ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' medical school students ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' Practice Management ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' early onset ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' person centered ', ' stem ', ' demographics ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' student training ', ' unconscious bias ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' data resource ', ' cognitive interview ', ' ']",NIA,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2020,86007,0.08338586038043906
"Expanding the CAARN to accelerate research on multiple chronic conditions with rural and African-American communities and health-care providers Project Summary/Abstract Three out of four older adults live with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) that worsen health, shorten life span, and increase healthcare costs; this burden disproportionally affects African Americans. Despite the critical need for interventions to help older patients with MCCs improve self-management, existing programs have limited reach and effectiveness in underserved communities. Our long term goal is to increase the number and reach of self-management interventions available to improve the health of older adults with MCCs. The objective of this proposal is to create a mature and sustainable infrastructure that facilitates the formation and collaboration of research teams focused on the development and dissemination of effective new self-management interventions for older adults from African American and rural communities with MCCs. To achieve this goal, we will expand the Community-Academic Aging Research Network (CAARN), originally created in 2010 with NIH funding to facilitate development, testing, and/or dissemination of behavioral interventions to improve the health of older adults. To date, CAARN has facilitated community-research partnerships between 46 investigators and social services providers in 52 counties and 1 tribe. We propose to expand CAARN’s infrastructure from its primarily rural focus, to increase partnerships with health systems and African American communities, by providing: 1) trained research liaisons from partnering organizations representing health systems and African-American stakeholders; 2) training for researchers on building trust with African- American communities; 3) multidisciplinary experts who will consult during the design phase of interventions. These additions create a mature, sustainable CAARN infrastructure to accomplish our aims: Aim 1: Facilitate research to develop and test the feasibility of new multi-morbidity self-management programs for older adults that focus on activating patients towards self-management and empowering them to continuously engage in goal-setting and shared decision-making with their provider(s) to maximize behavior change; Aim 2: Demonstrate the effectiveness of new self-management programs for older adults with MCCs in improving quality of life, with a concentrated focus on rural and African-American older adults; Aim 3: Facilitate research to maximize dissemination, implementation, and reach of effective multi-morbidity self- management programs, particularly in rural and African-American populations. Using principles of community- based participatory research, CAARN will engage stakeholders from health systems, rural, and African- American communities on multidisciplinary research teams to develop, test, and research how best to disseminate interventions to reduce the substantial burden of MCCs. This should increase the availability of, and decrease the time to dissemination of, effective, practical interventions that are tailored to these communities and integrated into health systems to improve communications, clinical care, and health equity. Project Narrative This proposal will expand the infrastructure of the Community-Academic Aging Research Network (CAARN) by adding new interdisciplinary researchers and new partners from health care systems and African-American communities to facilitate community-based participatory research to develop, test, and research how best to disseminate new self-management interventions for older adults with multiple chronic conditions.",Expanding the CAARN to accelerate research on multiple chronic conditions with rural and African-American communities and health-care providers,9977111,R33AG061699,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Insurance ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Program Development ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tribes ', ' Wisconsin ', ' County ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Rural Community ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' Consult ', ' empowered ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Allied Health Profession ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health literacy ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' implementation science ', ' clinical care ', ' health equity ', ' shared decision making ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' project dissemination ', ' program dissemination ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' rural African American ', ' rural underserved ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' service providers ', ' self-management program ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R33,2020,612557,0.14694366829226044
"Racial Differences in Decision Making among Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Decision making in financial and health matters is of critical importance for maintaining independence and wellbeing in old age, and recent work in predominately older White adults suggests decision making worsens with age. While there is a paucity of knowledge regarding decision making in older Black adults, preliminary studies suggest there may be differences in decision making by race. Decision making can be viewed as a complex interaction of externally influenced contextual factors with two internal systems: a cognitive processing system and an affective processing system. Although racial differences in cognitive processing have been well documented, little is known about racial differences in other components of decision making, and these could have profound economic and public health consequences for a diverse range of older adults. The overall goal of this study is to elucidate racial differences in decision making among older adults and to identify the contextual factors, affective factors, and neurobiological mechanisms that drive them. Contextual factors, such as acquired financial and health literacy, socioeconomic status (SES), and perceived discrimination, vary by race, are often influenced by adverse social and environmental experiences over the life course, and could have important mediating effects between race and decision making. Life course experiences also shape internally modulated affective processes. Since differences in decision making are observed when affective processes interact with cognitive processes, affective factors such as trust, risk aversion, and loneliness could have important moderating effects on decision making by race. Both contextual and affective factors have recently been shown to impact the functional architecture of brain networks, revealing important insights into the neural systems involved in decision making. Regrettably, these findings have been almost exclusively in White persons; thus there is a dearth of knowledge regarding the neural correlates of decision making in Black persons. Racial differences in contextual and affective factors experienced over the life course may result in variability in the organization of functional brain systems. However, it is unknown how or whether any putative differences in functional neural network architecture may drive racial differences in decision making. Finally, Black adults are at greater risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our recent work has implicated poor decision making as a potential risk factor for AD in White adults; however, it is unknown whether and to what extent poor decision making is a risk for AD in Black adults. The proposed study will leverage existing clinical data from nondemented older Blacks and Whites participating in the Minority Aging Research Study (RF1AG022018), the Rush Clinical Core (P3010161), and an ongoing study of decision making in aging (R01AG033678) to collect new behavioral decision making and neuroimaging data among older Black adults. Knowledge of racial differences in decision making and the associated factors that drive them will provide crucial information for identifying potentially modifiable targets for intervention to address health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this study is to elucidate racial differences in decision making among older adults and to identify the contextual factors, affective factors, and neurobiological mechanisms that drive them.

"Older adults in vulnerable communities: Health and quality of life over time The dramatically escalating number and diversity of older adults are defining features of the world-wide population. Research demonstrates that older adults from marginalized and disadvantaged populations are at elevated risk of accelerated aging and premature death. The National Institutes of Health are committed to reducing and eliminating health disparities and have recognized that health disparities among sexual and gender minority people are one of the main gaps in health research. Recent population-based studies have demonstrated that sexual and gender minority older adults are at elevated risks of chronic health conditions, disability, and poor physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The proposed longitudinal research will follow more than 2,300 demographically diverse LGBT adults aged 50 or older recruited from all U.S. Census divisions. Based on an innovative health equity promotion framework incorporating a life course development perspective, this study will examine the risk and protective factors affecting the health and well- being of LGBT older adults over time. This multidisciplinary national research team, in collaboration with community-based partner agencies, addresses a critical gap by identifying modifiable mechanisms impacting health and HRQOL over time. Utilizing 8 years of longitudinal survey data and objective data (biomarkers and physical and cognitive measures) and linking with administrative data from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the primary aims of the project are: 1) Identify at-risk LGBT older adults by investigating trajectories of health outcomes over time, their relationships with stigma, and the mediating roles of stress; 2) Understand modifiable mechanisms accounting for variability in changes in health outcomes by examining the roles of identity management, social networks, physical activity, and barriers to health care as well as health service utilization; and 3) Examine disparities in multimorbidity, disability, and HRQOL by demographic factors (age cohort, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity) and risk and protective factors that account for health disparities. This study also harmonizes with external population-based data including Health and Retirement Study, National Health Interview Survey, and American Community Survey to enhance the study and ensure cost efficiency. As the older adult population increases, the health care costs associated with health disparities will continue to rise. To respond to this growing public health challenge it is imperative to identify groups at high risk of disparities and to determine the modifiable mechanisms impacting their health and well-being as they age. The findings from this research will generate much needed information to directly inform and guide the development of tailored interventions that can be effectively delivered within community- based agency settings to improve the health and quality of life of demographically diverse older adults. As health care costs associated with health disparities among the fast growing older adult population continues to rise, it is imperative to identify groups at risk of disparities and to determine the modifiable factors impacting their health and quality of life. Sexual and gender minority older adults have been identified as an at-risk, under-investigated and under-served health disparate population. This longitudinal research will identify risk and protective mechanisms impacting the health and quality of life of LGBT older adults, which will directly contribute to the development of tailored interventions to improve the health of demographically diverse older adults and subsequently reduce health care costs.",Older adults in vulnerable communities: Health and quality of life over

"Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research Overall Abstract The Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR), a mature social and behavioral science center of the Resource Center for Minority Aging Research program, proposes to expand its reach and impact by mentoring junior faculty (most of whom will be African American) and by focusing on African American Life-course health research. Michigan State University (MSU) will formally join the University of Michigan (UM) and Wayne State University (WSU) to form the new MCUAAAR. Our three specific aims include: 1) Increase reach and coverage by including Michigan State University as a full partner in the MCUAAAR; 2) Recruit and mentor 15 new junior researchers; and, 3) Increase important research on the life-course experiences of older adults of diverse ethnic and racial populations, especially African Americans. Four cores are proposed in this application; Administrative, Analytic, REC and CLRC. We will employ an integrative approach to mentoring, entailing a structured set of activities and training across the pilot funding period: (a) Formal goals will be set at the beginning of the pilot and reviewed in monthly MCUAAAR meetings; (b) Based on the goals set, a mentoring team will be assembled to assist with research, dissemination of findings, and research translation; (c) A set of training activities in scientific writing, measurement, and community-based research partnerships will be conducted each year; (d) A formal six-month evaluation will be conducted and shared with the MCUAAAR faculty; and, (e) During the second year, an ongoing MCUAAAR mentor will be assigned to assist with publications and grant preparation and provide support to junior researchers attending conferences. There will also be opportunities for longer-term mentoring and training in the program. We continue to be motivated by an NIH-funded series of studies (e.g., Ginther et al., 2011) in which applications from black scientists were shown to be 10 percentage points less likely to obtain grant awards than applications from white investigators; in practical terms, this gap means that white applicants are about twice as likely as blacks to be approved and funded. The RCMAR program has been important in helping to eliminate this gap for RCMAR researchers overall, and we continue to focus on the importance of abolishing the disparity for African American researchers in particular. We are also motivated by the continuing disparities in chronic disease and mortality among older African Americans. Project Narrative The purpose of the MCUAAAR is to recruit, mentor, and develop the next generation of diverse NIH researchers engaged in research on the science and amelioration of health inequities and disparities among African American older adult populations.",Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research,9977771,P30AG015281,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Capsicum ', ' pepper ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Evolution ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Universities ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' meetings ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' research dissemination ', ' research data dissemination ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' faculty research ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' urban setting ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2020,941815,0.0005178077448345926
"The Burden of Care for Adults with Dementia: Impact on Care Quality and Family Outcomes Project Abstract: Care for older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) during the final years of life is extremely costly and families carry a high share of this burden. Costs and shifting patterns of year-over-year spending are likely associated with adverse care quality and family financial outcomes, yet to date individual- level, comprehensive, longitudinal data on spending and its effect on outcomes have not been examined. Existing data also demonstrate that those vulnerable subgroups least able to cope are at greatest financial risk, which may result in further disparities in outcomes. Therefore, this project aims to understand the magnitude of this healthcare spending and its distribution across payers and families over time and how this spending contributes to disparities in care quality and family outcomes among older adults with dementia, particularly among vulnerable and underserved populations. The study will assemble data that capture total healthcare spending and proportion by payer (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, individuals, families, and others), using the nationally-representative Health and Retirement Study and linked Medicare and Medicaid claims data. Specifically, the project will 1) Compare yearly patterns of total health-related costs and proportion of costs paid by Medicare, Medicaid, out-of-pocket, informal caregiving, and other payers, in each of the last 5 years of life among older adults with or without ADRD and across vulnerable subgroups; 2) Test if out-of-pocket costs exceeding household wealth are associated with indicators of care quality (nursing home admission for long- term care, ≥3 transitions across care sites in the last 90 days of life, suboptimal hospice use, i.e. enrollment >6 months or <3 days, and in-hospital death) among older adults with or without ADRD and across vulnerable subgroups; and 3) Examine if out-of-pocket costs exceeding household wealth are associated with potentially adverse intergenerational family financial outcomes (cohabitation, caregiving and financial support by adult children) among older adults with or without ADRD and across vulnerable subgroups. The results will directly inform health and social policy, and help to ensure high quality care for older adults with ADRD, while avoiding impoverishment of families and compounding of racial and socioeconomic disparities. Project Narrative: This project seeks to better understand the burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias on individuals, their families, and society and particularly those belonging to vulnerable social and demographic subgroups. We will examine individuals' health-related costs across all payers (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, individuals, families, and others), year-over-year, among older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, compared to those without dementia, and assess how spending influences both care quality and family outcomes. The results of this study will inform effective health and social policies that will ensure high quality care for elders with dementias and better distribute public and private healthcare resources.",The Burden of Care for Adults with Dementia: Impact on Care Quality and Family Outcomes,9971423,R01AG054540,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' cost shifting ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Family ', ' Financial Support ', ' financial assistance ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Persons ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Privatization ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Policies ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Unmarried ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' exhaust ', ' Site ', ' Health Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' exhaustion ', ' Pattern ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' intergenerational ', ' high school ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Children ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' elder care ', ' longterm care for elderly ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' care burden ', ' cost ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial incentive ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' informal care ', ' Informal care giving ', ' informal caregiving ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' social vulnerability ', ' ']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,423750,0.030742853886729215
"Chronic Care Management of Geriatric Traumatic Brain Injury ABSTRACT Traumatic brain injury (TBI) among older adults has emerged as a new silent epidemic. Older age is associated with long-lasting symptoms and poorer outcomes after injury. A need exists for an acute-to-chronic disease model of traumatic brain injury to guide the chronic care management of older adults with TBI. Limited evidence exists on the patterns and continuity of care following discharge from acute and post-acute care to the community after TBI. This mixed-methods Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will generate data on the patterns and continuity of care to identify disparities in care and inform initiatives to improve quality of care of older adults with TBI following hospital discharge. The overarching goal of this NIA K01 award is to provide the candidate with a better understanding of the needs and provision of care of older adults with TBI, advanced analytical skills to evaluate care delivery, skills in translating evidence into health initiatives to improve care, and development of an independent research program contributing to improving health outcomes of older adults with TBI. The candidate's mentoring team includes well-established researchers in geriatric medicine, post-acute care, health services, mixed methodology, quality improvement, implementation sciences, and health disparities. The candidate will receive mentorship and training in four essential areas to achieve her career goals, which are to: (1) understand the clinical care processes and health care policies influencing health care delivery of older adults; (2) increase proficiency in advanced analytical approaches to evaluate health care delivery for older adults using administrative claims data; (3) develop, adapt, and evaluate real-world evidence-based interventions to improve health care delivery for older adults; and (4) accelerate career trajectory to becoming an NIH-funded investigator focused on improving care for older adults with TBI. Using Medicare data (2015-2018), the training activities will prepare her to address the following specific aims, which are to: (1) determine the patterns of care in older adults with TBI during the year following acute discharge; (2) explore facilitators and barriers to continuity of care, and elicit stakeholder recommendations to improve care following acute discharge among older adults with TBI, caregivers, and healthcare personnel; and (3) examine the association between continuity of care and health outcomes following acute discharge among older adults with TBI. The findings from this K01 will contribute to describing current practice, and integrate stakeholder perspectives to guide efforts to address disparities in care receipt. Through the research aims and career development training activities, the candidate will be better equipped to submit an R01 to evaluate the effect of implementing an evidence-based, patient-informed transitional care intervention to improve care continuity and health outcomes following discharge among older adults with TBI. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Older adults are at increased risk of sustaining a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Limited evidence exists on the patterns of care and services provided to older adults who transition home following acute or post-acute care hospitalization.

"Impact of AD/ADRD on Health-Related Outcomes in a Statewide Population Enrolled in a Publicly-Funded HCBS Waiver Program for Older Adults Project Summary  Many states are aggressively reforming their long-term services and supports systems by constraining the growth of nursing homes and expanding availability of home and community-based services (HCBS) through Medicaid waiver programs, which intend to maximize independent living for individuals at risk for nursing home care. Eligibility criteria for Medicaid HCBS waiver programs include financial and health-related factors, the latter which typically include functional and cognitive deficits. Medicaid HCBS waiver program populations of older adults across the states include individuals living at home with and without diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) as well as with a wide range of cognitive deficits even without a diagnosis of ADRD.  ADRD is associated with many adverse health-related outcomes in population-based studies of community-dwelling older adults; however, whether and how ADRD and cognitive impairment severity are associated with adverse outcomes among older adults receiving services from Medicaid HCBS waiver programs is unknown. Little is known about the strength of informal caregiver support systems and their effects on adverse outcomes for older adults with and without dementia in HCBS programs. Success in meeting self-identified goals of care among older Medicaid HCBS waiver participants, and barriers to achieving these goals, have also not been explored in the context of having ADRD. Moreover, how race and ethnicity might modify effects in associations between ADRD, informal support systems, and health outcomes is unknown in this population.  We propose to address these important and interrelated knowledge gaps guided by person-centeredness and health disparities conceptual frameworks. We will study a statewide population enrolled in Connecticut's Home Care Program for Elders (CHCPE), the Medicaid HCBS waiver program for older adults. CHCPE has a racially and ethnically diverse population, and State Medicaid policy decision-makers have expressed strong interest in improving dementia care for CHCPE participants. In Connecticut, a person-centered approach to care planning and implementation guides all Medicaid HCBS waiver program policies and practices.  Specific aims guiding this study are to, in the CHCPE participant population: Aim 1: Determine how living with ADRD is associated with health service utilization, including emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and post-acute or long-term admission to nursing homes. Aim 2: Determine whether strength of the informal caregiver support system is associated with utilization of all health services under study, according to ADRD status and racial and ethnic group membership. Aim 3: Determine how living with ADRD, and racial and ethnic group membership, are associated with meeting self-identified goals of care and person-centered outcomes based on their HCBS-related experiences.  The study team will disseminate findings to state Medicaid officials and other stakeholders concerned with how best to help CHCPE clients living with ADRD avoid or delay adverse health outcomes and achieve self- identified goals of care. Dissemination activities also will include presentations at annual meetings of relevant national professional and scientific organizations, and publications in relevant peer-reviewed journals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many states are aggressively reforming their long-term services and supports systems by constraining the growth of nursing homes and expanding the availability of home and community-based services (HCBS), especially through the growth of Medicaid waiver programs, which intend to delay or avoid nursing home admission for individuals living at home and at risk for nursing home care.

"Impact of state HCBS generosity on dementia outcomes and disparities Project Summary/Abstract  Nearly 6 million people in the United States currently live with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia (ADRD) and this number will be more than doubled by 2050. Patients with ADRD have difficulties with memory, language, problem-solving and other cognitive skills that affect their abilities to perform daily activities. Since over 70% of older patients with ADRD live at home and receive the majority of their care in the community, appropriate home- and community-based services (HCBS) for patients with dementia are critical to meet their preference to age in place, avoid unnecessary institutional care use, and reduce caregiver burdens. About 19% of older adults live in rural areas in the US, and older adults living in rural areas tend to have higher rate of dementia and worse cognitive functioning performance than those living in urban areas. Moreover, about 24% of community-living older adults with ADRD are low income and qualify for state Medicaid financial eligibility criteria, and an increasing percentage of people with ADRD are racial/ethnic minorities. A vast body of literature in the past several decades has reported rural-urban, racial/ethnic, and income disparities in important health outcomes, such as unmet needs for basic daily activities, and hospitalizations among community-living older adults with ADRD. These disparities persist in recent years. The two major state programs that support HCBS for older/disabled adults – Medicaid long-term services and supports (LTSS) coverage and Title III programs under the Older Americans Act (OAA) of 1965 – are shown to help improve health outcomes and quality of life for community-living older adults. These two programs together target low- income aged/disabled persons and others with the greatest economic and social needs. It is thus expected that the increased generosity of the two state HCBS programs will benefit the most vulnerable subgroups of older adults in particular, such as those with severe cognitive impairments or rural residents, and help reduce disparities in health outcomes. However, empirical evidence does not exist on whether more generous state HCBS policies help reduce the differences in health outcomes between ADRD and non-ADRD patients or redress the persistent outcome disparities related to rural residence, race/ethnicity, and poverty among community-living ADRD patients. This study proposes to fill this knowledge gap by determining the longitudinal and cross sectional impact of overall state generosity in supporting HCBS through the two major programs, as well as the generosity of individual subtypes of HCBS programs (e.g. home-delivered meals under the OAA), on gaps in health outcomes among a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries (age≥65 years) with or without ADRD living in the community. Findings of this project will illuminate the ways with which major state HCBS policies impact the equity and outcomes of care received by community-living ADRD patients, and inform future efforts aimed to improve the effectiveness of state HCBS programs.

"Evaluation of Racial Differences in Cardiorespiratory Fitness Decline with Aging & Underlying Biological Mechanisms Project Abstract: Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is common in older adults and increasing in prevalence. Furthermore, there are substantial racial disparities in the burden of HF, including HFpEF, such that African American (AA) have much higher prevalence of HF than other races. In a series of epidemiological studies, we have demonstrated that low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), measured as peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) on a maximal stress test, is a strong independent predictor of higher risk of HF, particularly HFpEF, in older adults. Furthermore, CRF levels among AA are consistently lower as compared with other races. Taken together, low CRF and accelerated age-related decline in CRF may be key contributors to the racial differences in the burden of HF. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the racial disparities in prevalence of low CRF and age-related CRF decline is key to developing novel, effective approaches to prevention of HF in older AA adults. Accordingly, in this study, we aim to evaluate the racial differences in age-related decline in CRF and their underlying biological mechanisms. To this end, we will perform a nested case-control study within the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), a multi-ethnic cohort of community- dwelling individuals, including older AA and white adults matched for age, sex, and risk factors (BMI, systolic blood pressure, diabetes status) who underwent CRF testing in middle-age (mean age 50-55) as part of the DHS phase 2 visit (2007-09) and are participating in the DHS phase 3 10-years later (2019-2022). Participants will undergo repeat CRF assessment and comprehensive state-of-the-art phenotyping to comprehensively evaluate the potential mechanisms of racial differences in CRF, including the following: stroke volume reserve by echocardiogram, heart rate reserve, myocardial perfusion, myocardial energetics by cardiac MRI, skeletal muscle energetics assessment by 7T MRI, and regional adipose tissue by whole body MRI. Peak VO2 combined with its central and peripheral determinants will be compared among matched AA and white participants in the DHS phase 3. Successful completion of these two aims will quantify the CRF decline in AA versus white older individuals for the first time and elucidate specific mechanisms, thereby, providing critical insight into the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of low CRF. Project Narrative: Older adults and African Americans have low levels of fitness. Based on our prior work, low fitness is an important risk factor for heart failure.

"Research and Mentorship in Medical Decision Making for Chronic Diseases of Older Adults PROJECT ABSTRACT: Medical decisions for many chronic diseases such as diabetes are becoming more complex as the number of available therapies expand and as we learn how risk factor targets and treatments may need to be individualized based on a patient's clinical characteristics, genetic profiles, treatment preferences, and social circumstances. To strengthen training and research in medical decision making in the study of chronic diseases of older adults, Dr. Elbert Huang, Professor of Medicine at the University of Chicago, is submitting this K24 renewal proposal. The University of Chicago is an ideal environment for this program because of its well-established clinical research programs, history of interdisciplinary collaboration, and significant strengths in the social sciences. The overall goal of the program is to support young investigators who are studying medical decision making in older adults living with individual or multiple chronic diseases. Trainees of the program will have access to cohort studies of older adults (Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, the National Social Life Health and Aging Project, national Medicaid and Medicare Claims), support for the construction and evaluation of simulation models of chronic diseases, guidance for developing decision support interventions, and facilitated access to the UChicago Practice-Based Research Network. In his own research in geriatric diabetes, Dr. Huang will pursue the following aims: 1) advance the study of variation in diabetes onset, complications and treatment response in observational studies; 2) advance the development of simulation models of diabetes complications; and 3) advance the development of diabetes decision support for personalizing care for older adults. In two ongoing observational studies (R01 AG060756, R01 AG063391), Dr. Huang will explore population-level variation in the onset of diabetes and its complications as well as variation in response to achieved glucose targets and treatments. As part of Aim 2, Dr. Huang is part of an investigative team led by his mentee, Dr. Neda Laiteerapong (R01 MD013420) developing a new simulation model of diabetes complications using multi-ethnic data from the Kaiser Registry. This model will be comprised of a series of individual outcome prediction models (cardiovascular events, hypoglycemia, dementia, mortality) that interwoven together. Under Aim 3, Dr. Huang will first complete evaluation of a trial of a decision support tool (My Diabetes GOAL) created during his initial K24. The tool, embedded within the electronic medical record, is designed to engage patients in personalized goal setting and disease management with the support of a nurse. He will also develop an updated stakeholder-informed diabetes decision support intervention for personalized care for older adults, addressing both goal setting and treatment selection. This K24 award will allow Dr. Huang to strengthen his mentorship program in medical decision making in chronic diseases and expand his research portfolio in new directions that will guide individualization of care for diverse populations of patients living with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medical decisions in chronic diseases of older adults are becoming more complex as we learn to individualize targets and treatments based on clinical characteristics, genetic profiles, treatment preferences, and social circumstances. This award will allow Dr. Elbert Huang to devote 25% of his time to training the next generation of researchers in medical decision making and expand his research in epidemiology, pharmacoepidemiology, and decision support interventions.

"Diabetes and Prediabetes in Older Adults in ARIC ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults are at increased risk for diabetes but there is controversy regarding prognosis in prediabetes and diabetes, appropriate screening and treatment targets, and how best to reduce cardiovascular risk and prevent cognitive and physical impairment, especially in persons aged 70 years or higher. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study is an ongoing, community-based study of 15,792 participants originally recruited in 1987-1989. For over 25 years, ARIC investigators have conducted detailed assessments of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors including diabetes. At the most recent visit 5 (2011- 2013), the mean age of participants was 75 years, 23% were black, and 33% of participants had diagnosed diabetes. New visits in ARIC are planned from 2016 to 2019. This application is a request for funding of an approved ARIC ancillary study to add key diabetes-related measures to the upcoming visits. Aims: 1) Quantify the risk of incident prediabetes and diabetes in older black and white adults using multiple biomarkers; 2) Characterize the risk of clinical microvascular and macrovascular outcomes in older adults with diabetes, paying particular attention to differences in risk in older onset compared to middle-aged onset diabetes; 3) Characterize the association of prediabetes with risk of clinical and subclinical and clinical outcomes in older adults including physical and cognitive dysfunction; 4) Identify risk factors for hypoglycemia in older adults with diabetes and its associations with cardiovascular risk, mortality, and cognition. We will also evaluate the associations of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia with neuropathy, care practices, diabetes awareness and treatment satisfaction. Design and Methods: We will collect biospecimens from over 4,000 ARIC participants at the upcoming visits and conduct measurements of standard and nontraditional biomarkers of hyperglycemia, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. We will also conduct new assessments of hypoglycemia, neuropathy, preventive care practices, and diabetes treatment satisfaction. The proposed assessments will add over 5 years of additional follow-up (from visit 5) and will take advantage of ongoing surveillance for all hospitalizations, adjudicatin of cardiovascular and other events, and linkage to Medicare data. Significance: This competing renewal is designed to address long-standing controversies in the field and inform our understanding of the burden and clinical implications of prediabetes and diabetes in older adults. We will shed light on prognosis in heterogeneous glycemic subgroups and the performance of different markers of hyperglycemia. The data generated will provide evidence to assist clinicians in formulating more specific recommendations regarding testing, prognosis, and race- and age-related differences in risk associated with diabetes in older age. Results of this study will have direct relevance to clinical practice and inform strategies for the management of diabetes in older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetes is common in older adults but there are major uncertainty regarding how to best identify, treat, and manage diabetes in this population. This study will address major controversies in the field regarding the health effects of elevated glucose in older adults. The overarching goal of this application is to provide evidence to inform best practices for screening and clinical management of older adults with prediabetes or diabetes.",Diabetes and Prediabetes in Older Adults in ARIC,9843975,R01DK089174,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Albumins ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Creatinine ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Heart ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Fructosamine ', ' D-Isoglucosamine ', ' glycosylated serum albumin ', ' glucosylated albumin ', ' glycated albumin ', ' glycoalbumin ', ' glycosyl-albumin ', ' Troponin T ', ' tropomyosin binding protein troponin T ', ' Measures ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' community planning ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' prediabetic ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' neuropathic ', ' Neuropathy ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' Amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ', ' N-BNP peptide ', ' N-terminal pro-BNP ', ' NT-BNP ', ' NT-proBNP ', ' proBNP(1-76) ', ' pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76) ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' diabetes risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Subgroup ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Cognitive ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Cardiac ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' Risk stratification ', ' Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,629586,0.1833151345436494
"Evaluating disparities in older adult health, institutionalization, and mortality after implementation of Medicaid's Balancing Incentives Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Formal, or paid long term service and support (LTSS) have estimated annual costs of $211 to $306 billion in the U.S. and these expenditures are expected to rise as Baby Boomers age. Demographic trends including smaller family sizes, increased female workforce participation, and longer lifespans will reduce the availability of family caregivers, placing further burden on the formal LTSS system and especially on Medicaid, the nation's largest single payer of formal LTSS. Medicaid has been at the forefront of policy efforts to ""rebalance"" LTSS from institutional to home-and community-based settings. These rebalancing efforts reflect individuals' preferences to receive home- and community-based services (HCBS) and these transitions have also been shown to save about 15% in per capita LTSS spending over 10 years. In spite of this increased focus, evaluations of these rebalancing policies have largely neglected health and mortality outcomes, disparities in outcomes, and effects on older adults with specific health conditions such as dementia, who may have higher than average Medicaid expenditures. The most recently implemented rebalancing policy is the Balancing Incentive Program (BIP), which offers additional funding to states to increase access to LTSS in states that were spending less than 50% of LTSS expenditures on HCBS. We will conduct the first formal evaluation of BIP's effects on four health outcomes: self-rated health, functioning, long-term institutionalization, and mortality. There is reason to suspect that disparities in these outcomes may also be affected after BIP's implementation, as whites and minorities tend to employ very different LTSS strategies and have different levels of access to care. Similarly, individuals living in rural areas are more likey than their urban counterparts to have few or distant medical providers and fragmented care coordination, all of which limit their ability to obtain necessary care and adversely affect individual and population health outcomes. This proposal employs a mixed-method approach to (1) conduct qualitative analyses to identify states' BIP implementation stages and challenges; (2) test the effect of BIP implementation on the four health outcomes using a difference-in- difference approach that capitalizes on the quasi-experimental framework to compare states that did and did not (but were eligible to) implement BIP; (3) assess racial/ethnic and rural/urban differences in BIP's effects on health; and (4) examine whether health conditions and access to informal care (unpaid care generally provided by family), and county- or state-level access to formal care further modify the effects of BIP on health outcomes and disparities. Multiple administrative and survey databases spanning 2008-2017 will be merged to examine health outcomes for dual-eligible adults 65 years and older who live in BIP and non-BIP states. The goal of this study is to provide policymakers with rigorous analyses of BIP's effects on health and health disparities. While these analyses focus on BIP, the results have implications for HCBS more generally and for understanding how rebalancing policies influence health and health disparities in older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal evaluates the U.S.'s most recent long-term services and supports (LTSS) rebalancing policy, the Balancing Incentive Program (BIP), which bolsters participating states' ability to increase access to care in home- and community-based settings. We will examine how BIP implementation influences older adults' self- reported health, functioning measured by activities of daily living, risk of long-term institutionalization, and ris of mortality. Further, we test whether BIP implementation reduces or exacerbates existing racial/ethnic and rural/urban disparities in these outcomes. We also examine whether these effects vary by an individual's health conditions, access to informal (unpaid) care from family members, and access to formal (paid) care at the county and state levels.","Evaluating disparities in older adult health, institutionalization, and mortality after implementation of Medicaid's Balancing Incentives Program",9842684,R01MD010360,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Family Sizes ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' home health care ', ' home healthcare ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Policies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Urban Health ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' Home Care ', ' patient homecare ', ' patient home care ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' single payer ', ' Single-Payer System ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Distant ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' success ', ' Stretching ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' dual eligible ', ' community based service ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' waiver ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' informal care ', ' urban residence ', ' urban disparity ', ' rural resident ', ' rural dwellers ', ' rural dwelling ', ' rural households ', ' rural residence ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' incentive-based program ', ' incentive program ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' baby boomer ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2020,788755,0.06624980533366984
"Social Distancing and Mental Health in Diverse Aging Populations New Jersey has the 2nd highest number of COVID-19 cases and mortality in the US, especially elderly with vulnerabilities such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Thus, the local governmental response has drastically altered the daily activities of New Jersey residents, especially through the endorsement and enforcement of social distancing for the general public. While the theoretical benefits of social distancing are clear and it is a likely effective tool in reducing the spread of communicable disease like COVID-19, there are known consequences of isolation and loneliness for older adults, which has been linked to numerous negative health outcomes. The practice and impact of social distancing contains multiple facets, including the spaces which it is practiced, the activities it may impact, and the degrees to which it is practiced. NJ residents have additionally experienced acute racial disparities in relationship to COVID-19 outcomes.  The objective of this application is to leverage the infrastructure from the New Jersey Minority Aging Collaborative (R24AG063729) to prospectively quantify the impact of social distancing on mental health in African American, Hispanic, and Asian aging populations, especially those with cognitive impairment, subjective memory loss, or Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). In its first year, the parent grant has made significant progress in implementing its aims through the establishment and expansion of institutional capacity to foster academic-community partnerships. Through this parent project, we have additionally begun responses to continue and expand community engagement throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Through a study of 600 minority older adults (200 African American, 200 Hispanic, and 200 Asian), this administrative supplement aims to link the infrastructure of the parent grant to understand the practice, experience, and impacts of social distancing (currently at its height) on mental health among minority older adults through biweekly/monthly telephone interviews and weekly self-reported (social distancing practice and psychosocial wellbeing) through a multi-lingual, intuitive, and user friendly survey application.  This study aims to: 1) Quantify the factors that leads to the adherence to social distancing among community-dwelling African American, Hispanic and Asian older adults; 2) Quantify the intended and unintended consequences (hygiene, psychological outcomes, social outcomes) of social distancing in above populations; and 3) Quantify the independent and potential joint influence of resilience factors (individual and family level) that might moderate the negative mental health consequences associated with social distancing in above population of older adults. We will additionally seek to understand the experience of social distancing among minority older adults with cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) through additional analyses. In totality, this administrative supplement will provide critical data and knowledge about the health and wellbeing of African American, Hispanic, and Asian older adults during the COVID-19 era. COVID-19 is greatly impacting minority older adults in relationship to disease severity and mortality, but less is known about the experience of social distancing in this population. In this administrative supplement to the New Jersey Minority Aging Collaborative, we will leverage existing infrastructure to prospectively quantify the predictors, moderators, and impact of social distancing on African American, Hispanic, and Asian older adults in an 8-week longitudinal study.",Social Distancing and Mental Health in Diverse Aging Populations,10149707,R24AG063729,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Anxiety ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Hygiene ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Joints ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' mortality ', ' Local Government ', ' New Jersey ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Social Distance ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Social Network ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' postiive attitude ', ' optimism ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Multilingualism ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Height ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' intergenerational ', ' member ', ' solidarity ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Adherence ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Process ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' user-friendly ', ' parent grant ', ' parent project ', ' mindfulness ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' institutional capacity ', ' community partnership ', ' web application ', ' web app ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' social engagement ', ' Infrastructure ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' ']",NIA,RUTGERS BIOMEDICAL/HEALTH SCIENCES-RBHS,R24,2020,390000,0.08414452976526823
"I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges Project Summary Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among older adults in the United States. However, despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer- related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. Barriers to appropriate screening are even greater for groups facing long-standing screening disparities, such as racial/ethnic minorities and individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES). Key drivers of screening underutilization are decision-making biases facing clinicians and patients, highlighting the need for scalable solutions that are designed to address these biases and tailored to overcome barriers facing high-risk patients.  Nudges, interventions designed using behavioral economic principles, improve behavior by addressing biases that lead to suboptimal decisions. Our team has extensive experience working with health systems to test and scale nudge interventions to overcome decision-making biases facing patients and/or clinicians. We have also demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, it is an ideal platform upon which to deploy large scale behavior change nudge interventions.  In this study, we propose to personalize nudge interventions to clinicians and patients, with a focus on how to tailor nudges to the needs of high-risk patients and how to implement promising nudges to improve cancer screening among older adults. We will pilot this work at Penn Medicine and then implement a pragmatic trial at sites in the Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health systems.  In the R61 phase, we will complete the following aims at Penn Medicine: analyze EHR and claims data and identify characteristics and subgroups of patients at high-risk for not completing cancer screening (Aim 1), test the feasibility of individual nudge interventions within an EHR nudge toolkit (Aim 2), and pilot test nudge interventions to identify the most promising approaches to increase cancer screening rates for high-risk patients in each subgroup (Aim 3).  In the R33 phase, we will achieve the following aims at Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health: conduct a two-arm pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of personalized EHR-based nudges to clinicians and patients on increasing cancer screening rates (Aim 1), evaluate if EHR-based nudge interventions reduce disparities in cancer screening rates for racial/ethnic minorities and patients with low socioeconomic status (Aim 2), and inform future design of tailored EHR interventions by examining heterogeneity of treatment response with respect to clinician and patient characteristics (Aim 3). Project Narrative Despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer-related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. In this project, we will pilot nudge interventions among older adults – including racial/ethnic minorities, low SES individuals, and other high-risk groups identified using novel analytic methods – and tailor nudges to overcome screening barriers facing these patient groups.

"BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, and shingles lead to significant rates of illness, hospitalization, and death among older adults. In the United States, vaccination rates have been mostly unchanged for a decade with lower rates among racial and ethnic minority groups. New and scalable approaches are needed to address this important public health issue. Nudges are changes to the way choices are offered or information is framed that can have outsized effects on behavior. For example, default options are the path of least resistance and the action that takes place if no alternatives are selected. Active choice is a method that prompts a decision-making now, rather than waiting for stakeholders to recognize the need to make the decision on their own. Our groups at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Medicine) and the University of Washington (UW Medicine) have formed behavioral design teams embedded within the operations of our health systems and have demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, this scalable technology platform is an optimal environment to implement and deploy these types of nudges. In this study, we propose to design, test, and implemented personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target barriers among high-risk subgroups to improve vaccination rates. We will pilot this at two health systems and then implement a pragmatic trial at those health systems and sites in the VA Health System. In the R61 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine and UW Medicine. Aim 1: To use EHR data and analytical methods to identify high-risk groups of older adults with suboptimal vaccination rates for influenza, pneumococcal disease, and herpes zoster. Aim 2: To assess the feasibility of implementing different types of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target the identified groups to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 3: To pilot test ways to personalize promising nudges to clinicians and patients for improving vaccination among older adults. In the R33 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine, UW Medicine, and the VA Health System. Aim 1: To conduct a 12-month, multisite, cluster randomized, pragmatic trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients relative to control to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing disparities in vaccination rates related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic factors. Aim 3: To evaluate heterogeneity in treatment effect across clinician, patient, and practice characteristics to further tailor approaches in future intervention design. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many older adults are at risk of illness, hospitalization, and death from vaccine-preventable diseases. Moreover, there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in care with even lower vaccination rates among African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians.

"Asian Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) Abstract: Overall RCMAR  We propose the Chicago Asian RCMAR to advance careers of investigators from underrepresented populations through translational trauma and resilience research amongst one of the most understudied, yet fastest growing populations in the U.S.: Asian American older adults. Such an important focus in research, population and investigators will inform both practice and policy at community, regional and national levels. Asians are the fastest growing yet most understudied US minority group at 21 million people and growing 56% from 2000-2013. Yet, < 1% of NIH research funding in the last 10 years were focused on US Asian populations, with only 3-5 total funded NIH grants/yr that focus on US Asian older adults. Moreover, this population experiences the “Asian Paradox”: while on average, US Asians, are the highest-income earners and the most highly-educated, more Asians, especially older adults, live below the poverty line, are less likely to participate in biomedical research, and suffer disproportional health disparities compared to white Americans. These health inequities are further complicated by the heterogeneity of these immigrant populations, especially with respect to culture, religion, language, sexual identity, and trauma exposure, many of which challenge our assumptions about the “model minority” stereotype. Such exposures and heterogeneities lead to isolation and further removal from opportunities to participate in research, thus restricting benefits conferred from population level research. However, despite this diversity, there are unifying themes across Asian cultures with regard to shared experiences of immigration, trauma, strong family bonds, cultural values and expectations, and the intergenerational nature of the aging process.  Building on two decades of rigorous aging research in minority populations and track records of successful academic achievements, we have leveraged strong existing transdisciplinary partnerships across multiple academic and community institutions to build a center designed to foster the next generation of diverse researchers in a nurturing environment that is conducive to success and promotes highly relevant and rigorous trauma, resilience and health outcomes research among Asian American older adults. We propose the following scientific lines of inquiry: 1) Understand the cross-ethnic variations in the social, cultural, and behavioral mechanisms of trauma and stress across Asian populations; 2) Explore the potential differential health outcomes associated with trauma, immigration, and mechanisms of resilience in ameliorating adverse consequences among Asian populations; and 3) Build institutional and community capacity that tests and adapts and implements evidence based behavioral change strategies to prevent and treat trauma, promote resilience, and mitigate the effect of stressful events in Asian aging populations. The overall aims of the application reflect the synergistic work of Administrative (AC), Research Education (REC), Measurement and Analysis (AnC) and Community Liaison & Recruitment (CLRC) Cores. Project Narrative: Overall RCMAR Despite the growth of US Asian populations, there are vast gaps in our knowledge regarding the social and cultural contributors to and consequences of trauma among Asian older adults, who are predominantly immigrants.

"Are phenotype algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults?- Revision Are phenotyping algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults? According to the latest population estimates by the US Census bureau, the United States population is growing older and more diverse, with their projections indicating that in 2035 there will be more people 65-and-older than 18-and-younger. In terms of diversity, the US Census Bureau projects that by 2060 the non-Hispanic White-alone population will shrink by 20 million, leading to the increased representation of currently underrepresented minority groups. These future population milestones paired with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) use in medicine, present a very unique and problematic problem: determining if AI solutions are fair for underrepresented populations within older adults. This has been a very debated issue, with opinion pieces in the New York times making it clear that when done incorrectly, AI solutions can actually worsen health disparities in underrepresented populations due to the nature of the training sets for said AI solutions. It is intuitive to understand how dermatology AI systems could be biased to perform better for lighter skinned individuals, due to the prevalence of said patients in the training datasets. Other biases come from the fact that there is simply a lack of diverse research subjects, which is why their mortality outcomes are considerably worse. Electronic phenotyping algorithms are the cornerstone for automatic identification of selected patient groups for tasks like disease classification, epidemiological studies and clinical-trial recruitment. These algorithms are both rule-based or probabilistic in nature (machine learning models), and are usually built by using bundled patient populations (everybody put together), with very few exceptions (due to the nature of the phenotype) having some sort of stratification of populations. This proposed project seeks to identify bias in probabilistic electronic phenotype algorithms for older populations and create best-practices and software tools to overcome them in order to lead to better health outcomes. Are phenotyping algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults? We will determine racial and age bias in probabilistic phenotype algorithms in both local, and national datasets. After characterizing bias, we will develop best-practices and software tools to improve the phenotyping process to achieve fairness for underrepresented minorities.",Are phenotype algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults?- Revision,10049865,P30AG059307,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Censuses ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Dermatology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Research Subjects ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Skin ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' patient population ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' race bias ', ' racial bias ', ' ethnic bias ', ' population stratification ', ' recruit ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' ']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,P30,2020,50916,0.06801977992868596
"Substance Use and Access to Care among Older Adults Project Summary The rate of drug overdose deaths has increased so rapidly due to increases in opioid-poisonings that the average life expectancy in the United States has declined. Although older Americans are less likely to misuse opioids, rates of drug overdose have increased the most among those aged 55 to 64 since 1999 and 45% of all opioid deaths are among individuals age 45 and older. In 2018, 80% of Americans with opioid use disorders (OUD) received no treatment. Older adults are particularly disadvantaged. In 2017, only 35 percent of treatment facilities accepted Medicare as payment and Medicare itself does not cover methadone, a drug often used in the evidence-based medication assisted treatment (MAT). Additionally, lack of geographic access to specialty treatment is a broad problem with 85 percent of counties in the U.S. lacking a treatment center with an opioid treatment program. For older adults, access challenges may be exacerbated as approximately 25 percent of Americans older than age 65 live in a small town or other rural area; a rate that is higher than for younger adults. Rural areas also tend to have fewer substance abuse treatment (SAT) centers and higher rates of overdose. The data typically used to track the supply of licensed SAT centers – the National Survey of SAT Services (N-SSATS) – do not allow lack facility identifiers that are necessary to distinguish between centers opening and closing and survey non-response. This distinction is important because survey non-response does not mean the actual number of facilities nearby (or access) has changed whereas openings and closings do. The overall objective of this R21 is to increase understanding of geographic access to SAT facilities and to health insurance coverage of treatment, whether it is related to disparities in treatment and how policies to improve access will affect long-term health outcomes and costs among older adults. Our specific aims are to: Aim 1. Track and characterize geographic access to SAT centers for older adults age 50+ using the novel Mental health and Addiction Treatment Tracking Repository (MATTR) linked to the Health and Retirement Study and the National Survey of Drug Use and Health. Aim 2. Determine the extent to which disparities for older adults exist in the availability of SAT based on urban-rural location and state-level opioid policies. Aim 3. Project long-term effects of disparities in access to treatment on health trajectory and healthcare costs using a microsimulation approach, the Future Elderly Model. The proposed R21 is a necessary first step to creating data linkages between the novel licensed SAT center repository with other nationally representative survey datasets and to applying microsimulation modeling to policy efforts to address OUD in later life. Project Summary Older adults in the U.S. have experienced the largest increase in drug overdose deaths in the past 20 years and now comprise 45% of all opioid-related deaths. Lack of treatment access is ubiquitous, but Medicare does not cover efficacious types of specialty care for opioid use disorder and older adults are more likely to live in rural areas where substance abuse treatment (SAT) centers are scarce, and rates of overdose are higher. In this study, we aim to increase our understanding of geographic access to SAT facilities and to health insurance coverage of treatment, whether it is related to disparities in treatment, and how policies to improve access will affect long-term health outcomes and costs among older adults.",Substance Use and Access to Care among Older Adults,10040789,R21AG068901,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Information Centers ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methadone ', ' Adanon ', ' Althose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Methadose ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Overdose ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Substance Abuse Treatment Centers ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Rural ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' tool ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' COBRE ', ' Center of Biomedical Research Excellence ', ' Centers of Research Excellence ', ' beneficiary ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' cost ', ' treatment center ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' evidence base ', ' overdose death ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' prescription opioid ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' medication-assisted treatment ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' opioid guideline ', ' opioid law ', ' opioid legislation ', ' opioid policy ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' opioid mortality ', ' treatment services ', ' overdose risk ', ' opioid treatment program ', ' non-medical opioid use ', ' nonmedical opioid use ', ' opiate misuse ', ' opioid misuse ', ' ']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2020,293435,0.1335077361963217
"Advancing Health Disparities Research in Aging: The Aging Research in Criminal Justice & Health (ARCH) Network Project Summary / Abstract Despite 20 years of unprecedented growth in the number of criminal justice-involved older adults (those under arrest, in court, in prison or jail, on probation or parole), the knowledge needed to develop evidence-based interventions for this population with high rates of early onset disease, disability and behavioral and social risk factors, is deeply under- developed. In particular, research to understand the life course experiences, the social determinants of health, and the drivers of later life health disparities in this population, including criminal justice involvement itself, is limited. Moreover, much of the research about this population has failed to study geriatric conditions (e.g., functional and cognitive impairment, falls, elder abuse, polypharmacy) that are key to understanding the health and wellbeing of older adults at each phase of criminal justice involvement (from arrest through community reintegration after incarceration). This lack of knowledge has profound impacts on public health as over 95% of incarcerated patients are eventually released to the community where they disproportionately rely on community safety net healthcare systems. The relative lack of evidence in this area of aging and health disparities research reflects, in part, professional isolation among the growing number of researchers who study aging and criminal justice involvement – many of them early in their careers – from a range of academic disciplines (e.g. medicine, public health, nursing, epidemiology, social welfare) spread throughout the nation with few centered at any one institution. As a result, vital interdisciplinary research collaborations are limited and junior researchers often lack the mentorship needed to pursue a successful research career in this area. In response, we propose developing The ARCH (Aging Research in Criminal justice & Health) Network to build research capacity in this emerging field and catalyze the impactful research needed to develop evidence-based interventions that meet the needs of this historically overlooked population of older adults. To meet these goals, we propose two specific aims: (1) to establish a multidisciplinary national research network to develop and refine the research agenda, measures, and methods needed to advance research on the health and social drivers of criminal justice involvement and health disparities among older adults over the life course and the consequences of criminal justice involvement on health in later life; and (2) to support new and established scientists to develop and implement life course research on the health of criminal justice-involved older adults by offering a research technical assistance program, creating a national mentorship program for junior investigators, directly funding pilot and exploratory research, and creating formal opportunities for networking to develop new multidisciplinary research collaborations. The ARCH Network will ensure that geriatric principles are front and center in studying the health and healthcare needs of criminal justice-involved older adults and will develop a research agenda that can inform correctional and community healthcare systems of opportunities across the life course where programmatic and policy interventions can be tested to reduce health disparities for this population. Project Narrative The number of criminal justice-involved older adults has risen dramatically in recent decades, resulting in a largely overlooked population of older adults with high rates of health disparities and profound, often co-occurring social and medical vulnerabilities. Yet health research has failed to keep pace with this demographic change, particularly in areas of knowledge that are critical to developing interventions to meet this population’s unique needs, including geriatric health, life course experiences, and the social determinants of health. This proposal will establish The ARCH (Aging Research in Criminal justice & Health) Network, a nationwide, multi-disciplinary community of emerging and established researchers, to catalyze research and interventions designed to improve health and social outcomes in the growing population of criminal justice-involved older adults.",Advancing Health Disparities Research in Aging: The Aging Research in Criminal Justice & Health (ARCH) Network,10021539,R24AG065175,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Arkansas ', ' Award ', ' California ', ' Capsicum ', ' pepper ', ' Communities ', ' Criminology ', ' Elder Abuse ', ' abuse of older adults ', ' elder maltreatment ', ' elder mistreatment ', ' elderly abuse ', ' senior abuse ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' Drug Legislation ', ' Drug Laws ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Medicine ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' comfort care ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Prisons ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Nursing ', ' Public Health Nurses ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Police ', ' falls ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' career ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Area ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Discipline ', ' homeless ', ' unhoused ', ' Homelessness ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' probation ', ' social ', ' parole ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Jail ', ' Consent ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' life-time risk ', ' lifetime risk ', ' Older Population ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' early onset ', ' neglect ', ' community reintegration ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' safety net ', ' community safety ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health research ', ' social health determinants ', ' race bias ', ' racial bias ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R24,2020,338119,0.06460163622250631
"Sex Differences in Chronic and Acute Vascular Responses to Aerobic Exercise in Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the U.S. in both men and women. Although biological sex is an important determinant of CVD pathophysiology, a major knowledge gap remains regarding sex differences in CVD prevention and treatment. A key early event in CVD development is endothelial dysfunction, characterized by impaired flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Aging progressively impairs endothelial function which independently predicts CVD progression and events. Therefore, strategies to optimize endothelial function in aging are clinically important. Regular aerobic exercise ameliorates endothelial dysfunction in healthy older men, but the data in healthy postmenopausal women are inconsistent with many studies showing no effect. The mechanisms underlying these sex disparities are unknown. Higher intensity exercise is thought to be required for chronic endothelial adaptations in postmenopausal women, but this has not been investigated. We have recently developed a novel exercise strategy by adapting high intensity interval training (HIIT) on a non- weight-bearing all-extremity (NWA) ergometer. Our innovative NWA-HIIT can be implemented in a larger portion of the aging population because it allows compensation for lower extremity musculoskeletal problems. The primary objective of this grant application is to examine sex differences in acute and chronic endothelial responses to NWA-HIIT in older men vs. postmenopausal women. Our overarching hypothesis is that acute and chronic endothelial responsiveness to aerobic exercise is influenced by sex in healthy aging and acute endothelial responses to exercise will be predictive of chronic endothelial adaptations. To examine sex differences in chronic exercise adaptations, brachial artery FMD will be determined at baseline, after an 8-week control period and after 8-week NWA-HIIT. To examine sex differences in the acute response to exercise, FMD will be determined at pre-exercise, the end of a single session of NWA-HIIT and after 1-hour and 24-hours post- exercise. The acute responses to NWA-HIIT will be measured in both the untrained and trained state (i.e., at baseline and after 8-week NWA-HIIT). To gain mechanistic insight, we will determine: 1) protein/mRNA levels of key factors in endothelial cells biopsied using a state-of-the-art endovascular technique and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 2) circulating factors in blood known to be important for endothelial function. This novel translational application will significantly impact the field by: 1) Addressing a fundamental gap in knowledge regarding how sex influences the impact of acute and chronic aerobic exercise on endothelial function in older adults; 2) Providing preliminary mechanistic insight into sex differences regarding in vivo systemic/cellular/molecular adaptations to exercise in older adults by studying endothelial cells, PBMCs and key factors in blood; and 3) Forming the foundation for future studies focusing on dissecting in vivo the mechanisms underlying sex differences in endothelial adaptations to aerobic exercise. NARRATIVE Biological sex is an important determinant of cardiovascular disease pathophysiology, prevention and treatment. The proposed research will examine sex differences in acute and chronic vascular responses to a novel exercise intervention in older adults. The expected results may have important clinical implications for improving vascular function and preventing cardiovascular disease in both men and women.",Sex Differences in Chronic and Acute Vascular Responses to Aerobic Exercise in Older Adults,9999423,R21AG063143,"['Aerobic Exercise ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Aerobic fitness ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Attention ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' brachial artery ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Endothelium ', ' Exercise ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' post-menopausal ', ' postmenopausal ', ' Postmenopause ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Training ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Attenuated ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' stressor ', ' PBMC ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Load-Bearing ', ' Loadbearing ', ' Weight-Bearing ', ' Weightbearing ', ' Weight-Bearing state ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' intense exercise ', ' strenuous activity ', ' strenuous physical activity ', ' vigorous exercise ', ' vigorous physical activity ', ' Strenuous Exercise ', ' in vivo ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' older men ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational strategy ', ' translational approach ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' healthy aging ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' cardiac rehab ', ' Cardiac rehabilitation ', ' endothelial dysfunction ', ' physical activity intervention ', ' exercise intervention ', ' exercise intensity ', ' exercise prescription ', ' treadmill ', ' Interval training ', ' disparities in sex ', ' sex disparity ', ' preservation ', ' biological sex ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,190625,-0.0017250067107292706
"A Practice-based Intervention to Improve Care for Women with Urinary Incontinence PROJECT ABSTRACT The burden of urinary incontinence (UI) on American women is immense in human and financial terms, and continues to rise with the growing population of older adults. The goal of this proposal is to improve the care for UI provided to women and, in doing so, decrease the utilization of specialty care while improving patient outcomes. Specific Aim 1 seeks to improve the quality of incontinence care provided to an ethnically diverse population of women through a controlled practice-based intervention involving primary care providers. Three Southern California medical groups will participate in a cluster randomized controlled trial in which 40 offices (12- 14 per site) will be randomized to undergo a practice-based incontinence intervention led by a urologist/urogynecologist ”clinical champion” who is a member of that specific medical group. The intervention will include physician education, individual performance feedback, electronic decision support, and patient education. The quality of patient care, as evidenced by compliance with the quality indicators, will be measured across the two randomized arms after implementation of the intervention. The investigators for this proposal recently developed and pilot-tested a set of quality-of-care indicators (QIs) for urinary incontinence that encompass care provided at both the generalist and specialist level. Compliance with these quality indicators will be the key means to measure quality. In addition, in Specific Aim 2, utilization of specialists will be compared before and after the intervention. The investigators hypothesize that improved care at the level of the primary care physician will reduce the number of specialty referrals. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will seek to measure the effect of the intervention on patient outcomes. Under the hypothesis that a practice-based intervention will improve disease-specific outcomes, symptom severity and quality of life will be measured at baseline by the urogenital distress inventory-short form (UDI-6) and the incontinence impact questionnaire-short form (IIQ-7). After implementation of the intervention, these questionnaires will be given a second time and outcomes will be compared between control and intervention groups. We expect that this intervention will also reduce disparities in care for underrepresented minorities.

"Peer Enhanced Depression Care: Using Peer Mentors to Provide Self-Care Support to Low-Income and Minority Older Adults Project Summary Depression is a major burden for minority and low-income older adults who are less likely to use mental health services, and development of new service delivery models is needed to improve the quality of life and address disparities to access for this group. We propose to test the effectiveness of a peer- delivered depression care program that is embedded in the community and linked to the patient's primary care clinic. Our first aim will be to carry out a randomized controlled trial of the Peer Enhanced Depression Care program in which peer mentors who have personal experience of depression meet individually with older adults recruited in the community for 8 weekly meetings focused on relief of depressive symptoms through self-care support and linkages to community resources. This group of low-income and minority older adults in the intervention will be compared to a group that receives non- peer visits that provide social interaction. The Peer Enhanced Depression Care program takes a chronic disease self-management approach and is guided by the conceptual frameworks of social support, peer support, and social learning. Our second aim is to understand mediators such as self-efficacy and loneliness that may be responsible for the intervention effect. Our third aim is to evaluate the implementation of the intervention by conducting interviews with stakeholders, including older adults who received the intervention, peer mentors, social workers, the older adult's primary care physicians and health system administrators to obtain their perspectives on barriers and facilitators to implementation as well as the impact of the Peer Program. Our goal is to use peer-delivered depression care to decrease the mental health morbidity of at-risk low-income and minority adults. The potential public health impact is high because our project seeks to increase access to depression for a vulnerable group of older adults who often do not get care and leverages an existing workforce of peer workers whose services are reimbursed in many states. Narrative Fifteen to twenty percent of older Americans (6 to 8 million people) suffer from depression but more than one- half do not receive any services, a burden disproportionately shared by low-income and minority older adults who receive few or no services. We propose to test a community-based peer model of depression care that provides self-care support for minority and low-income older adults recruited from primary care settings. Our project has potential for high public health impact, specifically, to increase access to depression care for vulnerable and underserved older adults and meet the needs of health systems that are extending beyond medical models of care to include lay worker and community-based resources.",Peer Enhanced Depression Care: Using Peer Mentors to Provide Self-Care Support to Low-Income and Minority Older Adults,10022339,R01MH123165,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Appointment ', ' Charge ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Social Workers ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' information gathering ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial support ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' Health system ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' community organizations ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' primary care setting ', ' intervention effect ', ' social learning ', ' peer instruction ', ' peer led team learning ', ' peer mentoring ', ' peer teaching ', ' peer coaching ', ' peer support ', ' mentoring community ', ' Relationship-Building ', ' Active Listening ', ' depressive model ', ' depression model ', ' recruit ', ' Service model ', ' care delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' Service delivery model ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,570536,0.01814390604674739
"New Jersey Minority Aging Collaborative Abstract In response to PAR-18-749 (R24) to build collaborative teams to improve methods and outcomes regarding research participant recruitment and retention, we propose the New Jersey Minority Aging Collaborative (NJMAC) to improve research recruitment and retention and support culturally targeted and linguistically appropriate research for African American, Hispanic, and Asian older adults and their families. While NJ ranks as the 2nd wealthiest state by per capita income and 12th best in the country for overall health, there is a paradox in considering other population health rankings where New Jersey ranks one of the worst in disparity in health status (46th). For older adults in NJ, there are equally as large disparities when it comes to health and well-being especially among minority older adults, which is exacerbated by a lack of engagement in biomedical and social research. Additionally, there has been inadequate integration of community support necessary to empower minority communities in NJ to be fully engaged in biomedical research. These impediments necessitate further development and implementation of sustainable and equitable partnership among community partners and academic institutions through collaborative development, reciprocal transfer of knowledge, and expertise to improve recruitment and retention among minority older adults.  Using an adaptive and reciprocal “collective impact” design, the NJMAC will leverage and build team- science in NJ through Rutgers Institute for Health and Cooperative Extension in partnership with community organizations to foster trust with minority older adults and achieve greater intergration of community needs and research efforts. With a state-wide infrastructure and track record of culturally relevant community-research engagement, we aim to: 1) Build and sustain research capacity among academic and community partners through building a collaborative community steering committee and explore trust between collaborators to fully understand the barriers, challenges, and racial/ethnic and socio-cultural contexts of conducting research in and with African-American, Hispanic, and Asian aging populations across NJ; 2) Engage community members, their families, and partners through culturally targeted and linguistically appropriate reciprocal education, training, and measurements; manage a research repository to understand and document trust and feasibility of research recruitment and retention; 3) Expand, catalyze, and assess team science as a critical platform for collaborative research on aging populations and leverage an iterative platform for process and outcome evaluation among African-American, Hispanic, and Asian populations; and 4) Translate findings and lessons learned through the NJMAC to inform future academic-community partnerships in aging and AD-ADRD research; collaboratively build research resource to advance processes for recruitment/retention in diverse community settings at local and national levels. Findings and lessons learned will have significant implications for building community-academic research partnerships, culturally relevant research, practice, and policy. Narrative Despite the health disparities of minority older adults, there are vast gaps in approaches to engage these communities in culturally targeted and linguistically appropriate research efforts. In the New Jersey Aging Collaborative, we will build research infrastructure to reciprocal engage community members, their families, community partners, and academic partners throughout New Jersey to improve recruitment and retention of minority older adults and their families in biomedical research. Innovative approaches to build this infrastructure through the NJMAC will provide researchers with a breadth and depth in translational knowledge resources to further novel research, especially in particular areas of clinical and public health relevance like Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementia.",New Jersey Minority Aging Collaborative,10016166,R24AG063729,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Professional Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Resources ', ' New Brunswick ', ' New Jersey ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' ranpirnase ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P30 Protein ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' County ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' physically handicapped ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' empowered ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' social ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' information resource ', ' knowledge resource ', ' knowledge resources ', ' Information Resources ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Community Integration ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' volunteer ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' population health ', ' Minority Participation ', ' community building ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' minority communities ', ' recruit ', ' participant retention ', ' Service provision ', ' Infrastructure ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NIA,RUTGERS BIOMEDICAL/HEALTH SCIENCES-RBHS,R24,2020,1155522,0.043339039039335024
"Advance Care Planning among Midlife and Older Adult Sexual Minority Men Project Summary. In times of serious illness or at the end of life, many Americans receive unwanted care, including life- prolonging and painful interventions, and die in institutional settings. Advance care planning (ACP) permits individuals to communicate their preferences should they become unable to make decisions regarding their own medical care due to physical, cognitive, and/or communicative impairments. ACP improves the concordance between persons’ wishes and the care they receive, and increasing the utilization of ACP can yield benefits to patients, kin and families, and the health care system. Very little is known regarding ACP disparities and predictors among midlife and older adult gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). Existing ACP research has numerous gaps, and GBMSM have distinct life experiences that limit generalizing from existing data regarding ACP behaviors in the general population. It is not known whether there are disparities in ACP across sociodemographic groups such as race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status among GBMSM. There is also a need to identify psychosocial factors that may influence ACP behaviors among GBMSM. This research will examine formal and informal dimensions of two ACP behaviors (health care proxy, advance directives) using secondary data analyses from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, a longitudinal study of GBMSM with extensive data on sociodemographics, health and health care, and psychosocial factors. The specific aims are to 1) Describe the types and extent of advance care planning (ACP) among midlife and older adult GBMSM, and assess potential disparities across sociodemographic groups; 2) Assess differences in the prevalence of ACP across longitudinal health indicators, and longitudinal health care access and utilization; and 3) Test associations between psychosocial factors and ACP, and whether these associations differ across HIV serostatus groups. This research is critical to understanding ACP among older GBMSM, developing culturally-appropriate models of ACP, and addressing within-group disparities. Improving rates of ACP among GBMSM supports high quality care that is concordant with patients’ wishes during severe illness or at the end of life. These findings will also move the broader field of ACP research forward by virtue of examining factors that are understudied in ACP research more generally (e.g., psychosocial factors). Project Narrative. This project examines disparities and factors associated with advance care planning among midlife and older adult gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. Advance care planning helps individuals receive the types of medical care and treatments they desire during severe illness or at the end of life. By identifying disparities and related factors, we will inform the development of future research and interventions to increase rates of advance care planning.",Advance Care Planning among Midlife and Older Adult Sexual Minority Men,10012147,R03AG067871,"['Advance Directives ', ' advanced directive ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Bereavement ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Life Experience ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Persons ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Services ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Legal ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' cost ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', "" men's health "", ' male health ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' two-dimensional ', ' sexual minority ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' racial minority ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' The Multi-center AIDS Cohort Study ', ' The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographic groups ', ' sociodemographic group ', ' ']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,R03,2020,85364,0.0643555031243981
"Disparities in Access to High-Quality Home Health and the Impact of Public Reporting PROJECT SUMMARY Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) spends over $18 billion annually to care for approximately 3.4 million home health (HH) beneficiaries, little is known about access to HH for vulnerable populations (i.e., racial/ethnic minorities, low-income older adults, and older adults living in high minority and/or high poverty neighborhoods.) Prior research shows that lower quality home health agencies (HHAs) have higher proportions of minorities, low-income older adults, and beneficiaries from low-income neighborhoods. Reasons for these findings are not well understood, but they may be associated with disparate availability of high-quality HH for underserved populations. Additionally, there is limited information about whether or not current public reporting strategies (i.e., HHCompare Five-Star Ratings) have impacted access to HH or exacerbated disparities in access to HH. The long-term goal of this research is to ensure access to high-quality long-term services and supports for older adults in order to improve older adults' quality of life and care, regardless of individual- and neighborhood-level attributes. The first step towards this goal, and the overall objective of this application is to use national administrative datasets (e.g., standardized HH patient assessment data) to analyze differences in access to high-quality HH care for vulnerable older adults and to understand if and how public reporting influences patients' access to high-quality services. The central hypotheses are that low-income and racial/ethnic minority older adults, as well as beneficiaries living in vulnerable neighborhoods, are more likely to have lower access to high-quality HHAs as compared to their white, more affluent counterparts; and that HHCompare Five- Star ratings will negatively impact access for these underserved populations. To evaluate these hypotheses, the following specific aims are proposed: 1) Assess the impact of individual- and neighborhood-level factors on the utilization of high-quality HHAs among older racial/ethnic minorities and low-income older adults; and 2) Evaluate the differential impact of the HHCompare Five-Star ratings on the utilization of high-quality HHAs for vulnerable populations. To achieve these objectives, this study examines the national population of Medicare beneficiaries receiving HH care between 2012 and 2017 using enrollment, HH Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS), HHCompare, and Census data. The proposed work is innovative because 1) few studies examine HH disparities, 2) this is the first study to examine HHA and patient response to public reporting of quality summary measures, 3) it will link several national data sources, and 4) it will utilize models that jointly consider the relative influence of individual- and neighborhood-level effects. This work is significant because understanding within- (individual-level) and across-neighborhood disparities in access to high-quality HH, over time, can guide interventions and policy-making aimed at decreasing these disparities. This work is time sensitive and significant as it will generate critical evidence on how recent public reporting combined with individual attributes and neighborhood characteristics impact access to high-quality HH for vulnerable populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it examines the extent to which Medicare beneficiaries have access to high-quality home health, as well as if and how that access varies by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, and neighborhood. Ultimately, reducing health disparities and improving the health status of older adults in diverse populations begins with equitable access to high-quality care for all aging populations. This work is relevant to the mission of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) because assessing health disparities in access to quality care is critical to understanding health disparities among older adults and developing strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations, a goal established within the NIA's strategic plan.",Disparities in Access to High-Quality Home Health and the Impact of Public Reporting,10041137,R36AG068199,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Censuses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' home health care ', ' home healthcare ', ' Home Health Agency ', ' Incentives ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Mission ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patients ', ' Policy Making ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' care delivery ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cost ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' health equity ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R36,2020,53379,0.16097768234301232
"Access and use of long-term services and supports for older adults living alone with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias from four racial/ethnic groups One-third of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the United States (US) live alone. Previous studies have shown that older adults with ADRD who live alone have high risk for health threats. Because they lack cohabitants, who typically provide most of informal unpaid LTSS, older adults with ADRD living alone often have limited access to LTSS, which increases their distress. This also increases costs for unnecessary hospitalizations and institutionalizations. Therefore, the large population of older adults with ADRD living alone likely has large-scale underserved needs that constitute an urgent public health problem, but little is known about their access to, and use of, essential LTSS. Moreover, strategies for increasing access to LTSS are largely lacking and unknown. These knowledge gaps impede development, and thus implementation, of policies to ensure access to essential LTSS to older adults with ADRD living alone, especially with respect to racial/ethnic minorities who have increased risk of ADRD vs. Whites, often live alone and often have worse access to services. This project's objective is thus to elucidate specific barriers and facilitators to access to and use of LTSS among older adults with ADRD living alone vs those with ADRD living with others, and to compare how these barriers and facilitators may differ among racial/ethnic groups. We will then apply this knowledge to develop policy recommendations to increase access to and use of LTSS, emphasizing racial/ethnic minorities and older adults living alone. Building on the Goldberg-Huxley model, we will leverage our preliminary studies to conduct a longitudinal mixed-method study with convergent and independent quantitative (Aim 1) and qualitative aims (Aim 2) in Years 1-3, followed by a policy aim (Aim 3) in Years 4-5. The design and promise of this project were endorsed by our Community Advisory Board. Our interdisciplinary team's expertise in aging alone, LTSS, ADRD, health disparities, and policy positions us well to achieve the aims. The Specific Aims are: 1) To quantify multi-level barriers and facilitators of LTSS use among older adults with ADRDs and the extent to which these predictors of LTSS use vary by living arrangement (living alone vs. living with others) and race/ethnicity. 2) To elucidate in depth the barriers and facilitators to accessing and using LTSS via semi-structured interviews with older adults with ADRD, informants, and LTSS providers and administrators. 3) To develop policy recommendations to increase access to and use of LTSS among older adults with ADRD, emphasizing racial/ethnic minorities and older adults living alone. Our findings will inform development of policies to enhance the performance of LTSS in the US. Findings will support policies to increase access, affordability, acceptance, and use of essential LTSS for older adults with ADRD, especially those living alone and racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, the proposed project will likely reduce health disparities. Furthermore, this project will likely reduce unnecessary hospitalizations and institutionalizations, which will enhance the wellbeing of older adults with ADRD and reduce costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE A substantial proportion of the growing elderly population have Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD), and their progressive daily challenges to meeting essential needs (e.g., managing finances, medication, transportation) are exacerbated when they live alone and thus lack cohabitants who can compensate for the cognitive impairment, leading to emergent problems including untreated medical conditions, self-neglect, malnutrition, falls, and fires. To help address this large and growing problem, the proposed research will elucidate key barriers and facilitators to accessing and using long-term services and supports (LTSS) for older adults with ADRD, especially those who live alone and racial/ethnic minorities. The results of this study will support policies to increase access, affordability, acceptance, and use of essential LTSS for these vulnerable populations. 1",Access and use of long-term services and supports for older adults living alone with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias from four racial/ethnic groups,10054441,R01AG069147,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' development policy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Fires ', ' fire ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Interview ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Social Workers ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Friends ', ' falls ', ' Administrator ', ' Family member ', ' Latino ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' Malnutrition ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Home Care Aides ', ' Homemaker-Home Health Aides ', ' Home Health Aides ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' self-neglect ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Children ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Older Population ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' high risk ', ' family support ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' urban residence ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,806261,0.14607749319824806
"Mentoring Researchers in Advance Care Planning and Communication for Vulnerable Older Populations ABSTRACT The aims of this proposal are to (1) enable the candidate to further develop her research program focused on improving advance care planning (ACP) and informed medical decision making for vulnerable older adults and (2) use her research program as a platform for mentoring junior investigators interested in patient-oriented aging research, both within Geriatrics and other medical subspecialties. The candidate is a Geriatrician and Palliative Medicine physician who has established a high-impact independent clinical research program that is well funded with an outstanding publication record. In the 10 years since completing her Geriatrics fellowship, she has established herself as a successful mentor of students, fellows, and junior faculty who have published high-impact aging research, become successfully funded, and continue to participate in patient-oriented research in aging. The candidate has developed an extensive research portfolio focused on creating and testing literacy- and culturally appropriate health education materials to improve ACP and medical decision making for older adults. She developed a broader paradigm of ACP that focuses not only on one-time treatment decisions, such as for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but also on the process of preparing patients to communicate their wishes and to participate with clinicians in making real-time, complex medical decisions over the course of illness. She operationalized this paradigm into an easy-to-understand, patient- centered website called PREPARE that teaches patients, through videos, how to identify their wishes and communicate with surrogates and clinicians. The candidate received R01 funding from the NIA to test the efficacy of the PREPARE website to engage diverse, vulnerable older adults from an urban, county hospital in ACP using validated patient questionnaires. This K24 proposal will provide the candidate with protected time to expand her research in a new direction focused on direct observation (i.e., audio recording) of patient-clinician communication within primary care encounters in response to the PREPARE intervention. This new research will determine whether a patient-centered ACP website can empower and activate patients to discuss ACP and to facilitate communication with their primary care providers. The candidate will also develop her formal mentoring program with plans for the recruitment, selection, development, and evaluation of mentees who will become leaders in aging research. She will work with each mentee to establish a focused career development plan in which they complete research projects and develop the skills needed to become independent investigators. These plans will make full use of the outstanding clinical research training environment at UCSF. She will leverage her leadership positions at UCSF to recruit more mentees interested in research on ACP and aging in vulnerable populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will have unique public health importance because (1) it will increase mentoring of new clinical investigators interested in conducting patient-oriented research to improve advance care planning and patient- clinician communication for the rapidly growing elderly population, and (2) it will inform interventions to improve patient-clinician communication in the primary care setting, reduce health disparities in ACP, and result in diverse, older adults who are prepared for complex medical decision making.  ",Mentoring Researchers in Advance Care Planning and Communication for Vulnerable Older Populations,9851774,K24AG054415,"['Adoption ', ' Advance Directives ', ' advanced directive ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ', ' cardiac resuscitation ', ' heart resuscitation ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Medical Education ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' County Hospitals ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Leadership ', ' literacy ', ' Mentors ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' AHCPR ', ' AHRQ ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Palliative Medicine ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' empowerment ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Older Population ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' primary care setting ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' student-led learning ', ' student mentoring ', ' disenfranchised group ', ' disenfranchised population ', ' recruit ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' Infrastructure ', ' clinical encounter ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2020,187880,0.027643986098015265
"Impact of Behavioral Economic Strategies on Low-Income Older Adults' Food Choices in Online Retail Settings ABSTRACT The Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will support my long-term career objective of becoming an independent investigator who specializes in improving health behaviors and preventing chronic disease development in high-risk groups, including aging populations and those receiving nutrition assistance. Older adults have a higher risk of chronic disease, including several conditions strongly associated with poor nutrition. Increased intake of fruits and vegetables has been shown to lower the risk of multiple chronic diseases. However, very few older adults consume the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables, especially those with limited income. While most adults in the U.S. still visit a store to buy groceries at least once a week, online grocery shopping is rapidly expanding in popularity, including among older adults. The growth in online grocery shopping offers a promising opportunity to tailor healthy eating interventions to online food retail environments. However, to our knowledge, no research has evaluated interventions designed to promote healthier online food purchases among low-income older adults. To address these gaps in the literature, the specific aims of this proposal are to 1) develop the components of a behavioral economics strategy (i.e., healthy bundle defaults) to influence diet behaviors; 2) characterize the online grocery shopping behaviors and attitudes of low-income older adults nationally; and 3) examine the extent to which “healthy bundles defaults” and other behavioral economic strategies increase fruit and vegetable purchases among low- income adults in an online randomized controlled experiment. Data to inform the development of “healthy bundle defaults” in Aim 1 will come from the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS), a nationally representative survey of household food purchases and acquisitions, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) households. For Aims 2 and 3, I will recruit a nationwide nonprobability panel of 2,528 low-income adults aged >50 years through Survey Sampling International (SSI), an online surveying company that recruits volunteer research participants through their online panels and other online communities. The findings from the proposed research will support the development of novel and much- needed approaches to improving food purchases in an aging population with an elevated risk of developing nutrition-based diseases. My training goals closely parallel my research aims and will further enhance my understanding of: 1) aging and health, 2) behavioral economics, 3) experimental research methods, and 4) survey design and development. This training will be augmented with additional professional development activities, including attending and presenting at national academic meetings to disseminate findings.

"Epidemiology of racial differences in decision making among older adults ABSTRACT Sound decision making is important for maintaining independence and well-being across the lifespan but is critical in old age, when some of life’s most complex and impactful decisions are made. Recent work from our group and others has shown that decision making requires cognitive, contextual and psychosocial resources and that many older persons—even those without cognitive impairment—are vulnerable to poor decision making in key domains such as finance and health and frequently become victims of fraud. Poor decision making in aging predicts several adverse health outcomes including Alzheimer’s disease, incident mild cognitive impairment and mortality and poses a major public health and economic challenge. Importantly, however, most of the research on decision making to date has involved White participants. Relatively little is known about decision making among African Americans, despite well documented racial differences in the cognitive, contextual (e.g., socioeconomic status) and psychosocial (e.g., psychological distress) resources that influence decision making. Building on our conceptual model of decision making in aging and compelling preliminary data that suggest racial differences, we hypothesize that racial differences in decision making contribute to disparities in health outcomes and that contextual and psychosocial factors account for these differences. The goal of the proposed study, submitted in response to PAR-16-448, is to elucidate the determinants and adverse health consequences of racial differences in decision making. This study will leverage the unique resources of an ongoing study of African Americans, the Minority Aging Research Study, to collect new longitudinal data on multiple aspects of decision making (i.e., financial and health decision making, temporal discounting, scam susceptibility, fraud victimization) and related contextual and psychosocial factors in 600 older African Americans without dementia. These newly collected data will be linked with identical longitudinal decision making data already available from an ongoing study of more than 1,100 Whites from the Memory and Aging Project to support analyses of: 1) racial differences in decision making among African Americans and Whites matched on demographics and cognition, 2) the contextual and psychosocial factors that drive them, and 3) the degree to which racial differences in decision making contribute to disparities in health. Thus, this study is uniquely poised to efficiently identify the determinants and public health impact of racial differences in decision making and will facilitate new therapeutic approaches to promote independence, health and well-being among diverse older persons. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this study is to identify the determinants and adverse health consequences of racial differences in decision making among older adults. This study will yield new knowledge that is critically important for identifying modifiable targets for interventions to reduce racial differences in decision making and associated health disparities including the risk of Alzheimer’s disease among diverse older adults.",Epidemiology of racial differences in decision making among older adults,9986594,R01AG060376,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Cognition ', ' Decision Making ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Fraud ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Memory ', ' mortality ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Trust ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' psychosocial ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' health literacy ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' discounting ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' demographics ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive ability ', ' rate of change ', ' financial literacy ', ' ']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,691007,0.023100207124117325
"Understanding the Causes, Consequences, and Severity of Elder Mistreatment: A Longitudinal, Population-Based Study Project Summary/Abstract The current state of basic elder mistreatment (EM) science on risk factors and consequences to inform the development of effective primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention interventions is constrained by a literature with substantial methodological limitations. In particular, the field lacks longitudinal population-based research inclusive of vulnerable older adult sub-populations that provides generalizable and causally-inferred information. Further, population-based research to date has limited EM measurement to binary (no/yes) outcomes that obscure the variation in severity characterizing this issue. The goal of the proposed project is to overcome long-standing methodological limitations in the EM literature to advance more generalizable basic science on EM risk factors and consequences and to integrate severity into understanding of the problem. This study will collect a second wave of data (nine years post) from the population-based New York State Elder Mistreatment Prevalence Study (NYSEMPS). Drawing on a representative, probability Wave 1 sample, direct telephone interviews will be conducted with a follow-up sample (n = approx.1555) of older adults or close proxies, regardless of cognitive status or living setting to address the following aims: 1) identify longitudinal EM risk factors for older adults in the general population, 2) describe how EM severity changes over time among victims and identify factors predicting changes in severity, 3) identify longitudinal EM health consequences, and 4) understand the relationship between EM severity and adverse health consequences. The proposed study adheres to accepted conceptual boundaries that define EM as a distinct form of victimization and is informed by a longitudinal stress process conceptual framework. The methodological advancements underlying the proposed study have the capacity to generate the most valid, reliable, and generalizable information on EM risk factors, consequences, and severity to date. Findings from this study will directly inform targeted primary, secondary, and tertiary EM prevention interventions. Project Narrative Elder mistreatment is a pervasive problem affecting a growing older adult population that carries serious consequences, including mortality and physical/mental health morbidities. The proposed research will generate generalizable knowledge on elder mistreatment risk factors, consequences, and severity to inform targeted public health, social service, and medical interventions designed to prevent, respond to, and treat victimization.","Understanding the Causes, Consequences, and Severity of Elder Mistreatment: A Longitudinal, Population-Based Study",9977779,R01AG060080,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Communities ', ' Concept Formation ', ' conceptual processes ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Data Collection ', ' Elder Abuse ', ' abuse of older adults ', ' elder maltreatment ', ' elder mistreatment ', ' elderly abuse ', ' senior abuse ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Female ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' New York ', ' Population Growth ', ' Prevalence Study ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Probability ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Sociology ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Rural ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Physical Dependence ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' tertiary prevention ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' perpetrators ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Childhood maltreatment ', ' child maltreatment ', ' Child Abuse and Neglect ', ' Clinical Nursing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' modifiable risk ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' racial minority ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2020,156349,0.06728876729315356
"PAST-DUE (Prevention and Social Determinants: Disparities and Utilization in Latino Elders) Project Summary/Abstract  Americans aged 60 and over underutilize recommended preventive healthcare. Older Latino-Americans underutilize preventive services to an even greater degree than non-Hispanic whites, but the factors that drive this disparity most heavily are poorly understood. Some evidence in the health services literature suggests that social determinants of health (individual- and community-level economic, social, and environmental factors) affect utilization of preventive health care. It is uncertain, however, which specific services may be most underused by older Latinos, and which social determinants are most strongly associated with this group's utilization.  The dearth of knowledge about social determinants and preventive service utilization in older Latinos is due, at least in part, to the lack of comprehensive data on ambulatory health care utilization linked to data on individual- and community-level social determinants of health. This project will assess disparities in preventive service use between older Latinos and older non-Hispanic Whites, and identify the factors underlying those disparities. To do so, we will leverage a unique data resource from a large, national network of community health centers with shared electronic health record data that is linked to community-level social determinants of health data. This large, longitudinal dataset contains unprecedented data linkages which will let us assess disparities, evaluate which social determinants affect utilization and disparities, and determine which of these may do so most significantly over time; in so doing, we will address an important knowledge gap. Understanding the factors (individual or community) that most heavily impact preventive service use is crucial to the prioritization of population-based interventions to improve preventive screening.  Understanding the relative impact of social determinants of health on preventive service use in older Latinos will enable action/intervention in three ways: 1. It will enable more informed policy decisions to improve public health and wellness in older Americans. 2. It will facilitate strategic partnerships between healthcare providers and community agencies poised to intervene in social factors in the lives of older Americans. 3. It will help clinical providers understand their patients' barriers to care utilization, and further point-of-care efforts to address these barriers that influence their older patients' utilization of recommended health care services. Project Narrative  Many demographic and social factors affect the health of older Latinos in the United States, in part by impacting the use of recommended preventive health care. However, it is unknown which specific factors affect the use of specific preventive care in elders most significantly. This project will use a highly innovative, linked database that combines electronic health care data and community-level information to better understand which social factors most heavily affect the use of preventive care among Latino seniors.",PAST-DUE (Prevention and Social Determinants: Disparities and Utilization in Latino Elders),9967936,R01AG056337,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Americas ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Economics ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Language ', ' Literature ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' Community Health Networks ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' care seeking ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Preventative screening ', ' Preventive screening ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' service utilization ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' social health determinants ', ' screening ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' health data ', ' built environment ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative health care ', ' Preventative healthcare ', ' Preventive health care ', ' Preventive healthcare ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' health care community ', ' healthcare community ', ' fracture risk ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' data resource ', ' patient barriers ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' Migrant ', ' social factors ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,437526,0.012098677050760403
