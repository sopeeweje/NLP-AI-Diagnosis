"LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF SERIOUS OFFENDERS The proposed research is a long term follow-up of a sample of serious female offenders originally interviewed as adolescents.  In 1992, interviews were conducted with the entire population (n=127) of Ohio's only institution for girls and a comparable subsample of male institutionalized offenders (n=127).  These data were collected in connection with a larger neighborhood study which explored how gender and ethnicity may affect patterns of delinquency (n=942).  Because the level of antisocial behavior evidenced by the institutionalized females (and males) greatly exceeds that found among even the most delinquent youth within the neighborhood sample, it is important to attempt to locate and re-interview these more serious offenders, with the following specific objectives:  (1) to compare the success of the transitions made by the female in contrast to male serious offenders.  A successful transition will be measured by educational and occupational attainment, and life/relationship satisfaction, while a less than successful transition will be measured by continued involvement in criminal behavior, early/unintended pregnancies, and/or psychological distress.  (2) to determine those adolescent and adult processes which best predict variation in the kinds of transitions made by the female and male offenders in the sample.  Consistent with our interactionist conceptual orientation, emphasis is place on social network qualities and influences as they affect the desistence process; nevertheless we will also include attention to individual level (e.g., adult identities, roles and competencies) and structural level (e.g., economic marginality) variables.  (3) to compare the factors associated with desistence in a recent follow- up of the neighborhood sample with those affecting outcomes within this mores seriously delinquent subgroup.  (4) to determine the extent to which the long term consequences of delinquency, the likelihood of desistence, and factors associated with desistance are affected by respondent's ethnicity.  The body of scientific knowledge relating to female offenders is considerably less well developed than is that focused on males.  This disparity in theory/research continues to be justified by the greater prevalence rates among male adolescents.  Yet each generation produces a small subgroup of young women whose behavior is sufficiently disruptive and socially injurious to warrant official intervention.  We actually know very little about these young women, or the long term course and consequences of these early antisocial tendencies.  Findings from the comparative analysis we propose could be useful in the design of more gender (and ethnically) sensitive treatment strategies.

"MENTORED CLINICAL SCIENTIST DEVELOPMENT AWARD The overall goal of this career development plan is to establish an independent research program in the epidemiology of obesity in children at the University of Rochester School of Medicine. Prevalences of overweight and obesity are rising in the United States, especially among females of low socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minorities. Pregnancy has been described as a life event in which excessive weight can be gained and subsequently retained. Thus, research and training activities will concentrate on the identification of the independent and joint determinants of gestational weight gain and post-partum weight retention in adolescents and young adults of different racial/ethnic groups as major determinants of overweight and obesity in women. The specific aims are: 1) To establish a systematic training program in adolescent nutrition and behavior, special nutritional needs of pregnant adolescents, measurement of nutritional status in pregnant and non-pregnant adolescents, statistical analysis of longitudinal and multi-level data, and measurement and analysis of community-level variables; 2) To analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal data on biological, sociodemographic, behavioral, and community-level determinants of pregnancy weight gain and post-partum weight retention m women from the New York State Regional Perinatal Data System and the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (CARDIA); 3) To design an observational prospective study of adolescents and young adults to identify the biological, behavioral, sociodemographic, psychological, and community-level determinants of pregnancy weight-gain and post-partum weight retention among racial/ethnic minorities. The proposed career development activities involve training in the measurement and interpretation of body composition; in reproductive, behavioral/mental health, and nutrition and healthy lifestyle issues in adolescents; in Responsible Conduct of Research; and in longitudinal and qualitative data analysis. At the end of the training program, the candidate will be an independent investigator in the field of pediatric nutrition epidemiology. The clinical and public health significance of this proposal are based on a report from the Institute of Medicine suggesting that African-American women and adolescents gain in the upper end of the recommended weight-gain during pregnancy, a warning in the literature as to the health risks to young adolescents of retaining weight gained during pregnancy, and a national goal of reducing health disparities among Americans. In addition, there is a scarcity of empirical longitudinal data on the differential determinants of pregnancy weight-gain and post-partum weight retention in adolescents of various socioeconomic and racial/ethnic minorities. Examining biological, sociocultural, and community-level factors that may differ among specific population subgroups becomes relevant in order to tailor strategies which prevent post-partum weight retention without threatening either the mother's or the newborn's health.

"Reducing HIV Risk in AOD Abusing Multi-Cultural Youth   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed study addresses the               persistent disconnect between HIV prevention science and community practice as       urgently identified by the Institute of Medicine (1998,2000) and the NIH             (2000,2001).  Of noted priority is the need to transfer effective HIV                prevention interventions targeting adolescents to community-based settings           that directly serve the highest risk groups.  This study's primary aim is to         assess the effectiveness of a Cognitive Behavioral (CB) HIV adolescent               prevention intervention in an adapted design (CB-A) for implementation in            Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) by CBO staff.  The CB-A will be compared        to a time and attention matched Standard Care condition (SC) in a randomized         clinical trial, in which delivery of both is by well-established CBOs and            staff.  Similar to our originally developed CB that has shown great promise in       a research-based efficacy clinical trial, CB-A incorporates the same                 innovative mix of behavioral skills training, motivational enhancement, and          relapse prevention components of interventions previously demonstrated to be         effective and identified in the CDC's (1999) Compendium of HIV Prevention            Interventions with Evidence of Effectiveness.  In designing the randomized           clinical trial and the CB-A intervention for optimal translation and                 technology transfer, our academic university medical center research team has        formed a close partnership and collaboration with a network of CBOs,                 well-integrated as HIV prevention and treatment providers serving the                surrounding, socioeconomically disadvantaged racial/ethnic minority                  communities of Miami-Dade County, Florida.  This county carries the greatest         HIV/AIDS burden and is the most densely multicultural and urban area within          the state.  Using youth-serving CBOs as recruitment sites, the proposed sample       of 160 male and 160 female adolescents will be predominantly minority, low           income, culturally diverse, sexually active youths with recent histories of          Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) abuse.  The scondary aims of this proposed study        are to evaluate if key variables mediate and moderate relationships between          the intervention and HIV risk behavior outcomes.  This study is significant          because it addresses the urgent need to develop an effective, highly targeted        intervention that is usable by CBO practitioners to reduce HIV transmission          behaviors in this extremely vulnerable and risky population subgroup, in an          area of the country that is disproportionately affected by HIV and the               pervasive national problem of racial/ethnic health disparities.

The primary aim      is to compare the effects of E-CB on primary outcomes (HIV risk behaviors) with      a Health Promotion Comparison (HPC) condition, matched for attention, time, and      attention value, when administered under conditions approaching ecologically         valid ""real life"" community circumstances. E-CB is considered an enhancement         over existing CB approaches because it integrates key components derived from        ""effective"" CB adolescent-specific HIV interventions, as appraised in the CDC's      Compendium of HIV Prevention Interventions, and adds components to address           Soc-Influence (parental monitoring and parent-child communication) and Psych         factors (drug abuse & psychiatric symptom severity). The proposed sample of 160      male and 160 female adolescents will be drawn from a target population of            predominantly minority, low income, culturally diverse, sexually active,             alcohol and other drug (AOD) abusing youth-a group most disproportionately           affected by HIV and other health disparities.

"Understanding Social Status' Impact on Adolescent Health   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elimination of social inequalities in                                         health is one of the overarching goals of Healthy People 2010. Most past work        has defined social status as socioeconomic status (SES), an external measure         that does not account for subjective, internalized perceptions of social             standing. Most studies also do not explain how lower social status causes            poorer health. Using a new measure of subjective social standing developed by        members of the investigative team, this study tests a novel explanatory model        of social status' impact on health. The model identifies the HPA axis and            autonomic nervous system as critical biologic systems in the creation of social      inequalities in health. Social status, an environmental stress, causes               stimulation of these systems which, in turn, leads to alterations in                 neurohormonal mediators of the social status-health relationship. The study          dovetails to a new 4-year longitudinal cohort study of adolescent obesity and        Type 2 diabetes in a racially and socioeconomically diverse school district in       Ohio. Both of these diseases support this model. The specific aims are 1 )To         describe adolescents' perceptions of social standing and the developmental           changes which occur in these perceptions over a four year period; 2) To              characterize the associations between social status, measured both objectively       and subjectively, and obesity and insulin resistance among adolescents; and 3)       To determine the relationships between social status, measured both objectively      and subjectively, and potential biologic mediators of social status' impact on       health. To address these aims, yearly assessment of adolescents' subjective          social standing will take place. In addition, in Years 1 and 4, potential            primary and secondary biologic mediators (insulin, DHEA-S, blood pressure,           total and HDL cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin) will be obtained.            Parents will provide information on SES and their own perceptions of social          standing in Years 1 and 4. This study will provide unique, community-based           information on potential biologic mediators of social status' influence on           health. The population's diversity will enable us to differentiate the effects       of race/ethnicity and social status. The innovative measurement of social            status, which includes both subjective and objective components, may explain         some of the inconsistency in the SES-obesity relationship and the secular            trends in obesity and diabetes.

"Neighborhoods, Networks, and Adolescent Health   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a request for a dissertation            research grant (PAR-99-139) designed to stimulate minority doctoral candidates       to pursue research careers in mental health. The specific aims are to: 1)            develop a theoretical model, the Structural Inequality Network Model (SINM), to      examine how social networks and social support mediate and/or buffer the             influence of neighborhood race-specific inequality and segregation on multiple       mental and behavioral problems (i.e., depression, delinquency, suicide,              substance abuse, and violence) among adolescents; 2) develop measures of racial      inequality, and racial segregation at the neighborhood level that move beyond        traditional and static measures of poverty, unemployment, and female-headed          households with emphasis on the methodological properties of the inequality          indices, their theoretical grounding, and their integration into the                 development and testing of the SINM; and 3) examine how and whether                  race-specific inequality and segregation directly and indirectly (through            social networks and social support) affect each outcome. To accomplish these         aims, this study will use the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health,      a sample of 80 high schools and 52 middle schools in the United States. These        data provide a nationally representative sample of students (and racial/ethnic       over-samples) that links adolescents to a wide range of contextual variables at      Census block, Census tract, county, and state levels. To examine the                 simultaneous impact of individual and neighborhood characteristics, this             proposal uses hierarchical linear modeling, which allows researchers to              separate the impact of neighborhood-level errors from individual-level errors        and thus produces correct standard errors and efficient parameter estimates.         This research is expected to significantly contribute to the knowledge base of       the impact of social context on adolescent health. There have been few               systematic attempts to build a formal theoretical model that accounts for            ethnic differences in the impact that community factors, such as inequality and      segregation, have on adolescent mental and behavioral health. This study is          particularly timely since inequality is increasing across U.S. communities and       racial segregation continues.

"Understanding Social Status' Impact on Adolescent Health   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elimination of social inequalities in                                         health is one of the overarching goals of Healthy People 2010. Most past work        has defined social status as socioeconomic status (SES), an external measure         that does not account for subjective, internalized perceptions of social             standing. Most studies also do not explain how lower social status causes            poorer health. Using a new measure of subjective social standing developed by        members of the investigative team, this study tests a novel explanatory model        of social status' impact on health. The model identifies the HPA axis and            autonomic nervous system as critical biologic systems in the creation of social      inequalities in health. Social status, an environmental stress, causes               stimulation of these systems which, in turn, leads to alterations in                 neurohormonal mediators of the social status-health relationship.

"Adolescent HIV Risk-Social settings & Prevention Issues   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent HIV or STI clusters in youth are         associated with a particular social context for sexual behavior. The contexts        for adolescent sexual behaviors are understudied. Preliminary work in the high       HIV/STI prevalence Lower East Side of New York City indicates that                   approximately one-third of sexually active youth, age 11-16, have had a sexual       experience in a setting where multiple partnerships, partner age disparities         and concurrent drug/alcohol use are common; one in eight sampled 11-16 year old      youth report attending such a setting. We propose a two-phase                        qualitative/quantitative quasi- longitudinal study of sexual socialization of        LES 13-22 year olds. The project aims to describe for male and female youth 1)       the perceived sexual/relational norms and perceived availability of social           contexts for sexual/relational interaction; 2) the social controls and               pressures facilitating or inhibiting entry into and operating within social          contexts; 3) the relationship of norms and pressures to reported incidents of        HIV/STI/unintended pregnancy risk; 4) develop descriptions of high- and              low-risk relationship/setting trajectories using youth's descriptions of social      labeling and other consequences of setting participation, and youth's                descriptions of status and relationship management strategies attendant on           labeling and other consequences; and 5) refine provisional theory to inform          future research and prevention interventions. Developmentally- informed social       context and influence theories underlie our provisional model. Eighty 13-22          year old African-American and Latino/a youth will be theoretically sampled to        provide understanding of social contexts (e.g., particular high-risk setting         participation, no participation). They will take part in three in-depth              interviews for the study's qualitative model-building Phase 1. In Phase 2, a         refined model will be tested using a variety of multivariate techniques and an       additional 320 youth. For those youth that report on the same settings, network      analysis can be done of settings. Given the sensitive nature of the research,        we will be guided in study protocols by a panel with expertise in research and       service to adolescents, including intervention researchers, epidemiologists,         clinicians, policy analysts, legal advisors, and parents. Dissemination of           results will alert other investigators and interventionists to risks associated      with participation in particular social contexts among this age group, and           sensitize those who work with adolescents to the influences that adolescents         encounter within social contexts.

"MENTORED CLINICAL SCIENTIST DEVELOPMENT AWARD The overall goal of this career development plan is to establish an independent research program in the epidemiology of obesity in children at the University of Rochester School of Medicine. Prevalences of overweight and obesity are rising in the United States, especially among females of low socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minorities. Pregnancy has been described as a life event in which excessive weight can be gained and subsequently retained. Thus, research and training activities will concentrate on the identification of the independent and joint determinants of gestational weight gain and post-partum weight retention in adolescents and young adults of different racial/ethnic groups as major determinants of overweight and obesity in women. The specific aims are: 1) To establish a systematic training program in adolescent nutrition and behavior, special nutritional needs of pregnant adolescents, measurement of nutritional status in pregnant and non-pregnant adolescents, statistical analysis of longitudinal and multi-level data, and measurement and analysis of community-level variables; 2) To analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal data on biological, sociodemographic, behavioral, and community-level determinants of pregnancy weight gain and post-partum weight retention m women from the New York State Regional Perinatal Data System and the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (CARDIA); 3) To design an observational prospective study of adolescents and young adults to identify the biological, behavioral, sociodemographic, psychological, and community-level determinants of pregnancy weight-gain and post-partum weight retention among racial/ethnic minorities. The proposed career development activities involve training in the measurement and interpretation of body composition; in reproductive, behavioral/mental health, and nutrition and healthy lifestyle issues in adolescents; in Responsible Conduct of Research; and in longitudinal and qualitative data analysis. At the end of the training program, the candidate will be an independent investigator in the field of pediatric nutrition epidemiology. The clinical and public health significance of this proposal are based on a report from the Institute of Medicine suggesting that African-American women and adolescents gain in the upper end of the recommended weight-gain during pregnancy, a warning in the literature as to the health risks to young adolescents of retaining weight gained during pregnancy, and a national goal of reducing health disparities among Americans. In addition, there is a scarcity of empirical longitudinal data on the differential determinants of pregnancy weight-gain and post-partum weight retention in adolescents of various socioeconomic and racial/ethnic minorities. Examining biological, sociocultural, and community-level factors that may differ among specific population subgroups becomes relevant in order to tailor strategies which prevent post-partum weight retention without threatening either the mother's or the newborn's health.  Given the adverse health effect of obesity and the difficulties involved in maintaining weight loss, primary prevention of obesity is of particular public health importance.

"HIV PREVENTION FOR ADOLESCENTS: RESEARCH TO PRACTICE   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                                          This proposed study targeting drug abusing adolescents is a 5-year randomized        controlled trial of an Enhanced-Cognitive Behavioral HIV prevention                  intervention, augmented by components focused on Social Influence                    (Soc-Influence) and Psychiatric/Psychological (Psych) Symptoms. The primary aim      is to compare the effects of E-CB on primary outcomes (HIV risk behaviors) with      a Health Promotion Comparison (HPC) condition, matched for attention, time, and      attention value, when administered under conditions approaching ecologically         valid ""real life"" community circumstances. E-CB is considered an enhancement         over existing CB approaches because it integrates key components derived from        ""effective"" CB adolescent-specific HIV interventions, as appraised in the CDC's      Compendium of HIV Prevention Interventions, and adds components to address           Soc-Influence (parental monitoring and parent-child communication) and Psych         factors (drug abuse & psychiatric symptom severity). The proposed sample of 160      male and 160 female adolescents will be drawn from a target population of            predominantly minority, low income, culturally diverse, sexually active,             alcohol and other drug (AOD) abusing youth-a group most disproportionately           affected by HIV and other health disparities. We propose to examine how              intervention effects are 1) mediated by Attitude-Motivation-Skill variables,         Social Influence, and Psychiatric Variables and moderated by 4 key factors:          age, gender, cognitive functioning, and traumatic abuse history. HLM and SEM         procedures will be used to explore how study variables interrelate to predict        outcome. This project is significant in its response to the NIH priority on          translational research, in which HIV prevention is refocused on the adaptation       of ""effective"" interventions to reach new populations. The proposed project          further responds to the NIH priority on bridging clinical research and               practice, the emphasis is to bring interventions developed during efficacy           trials in a rigorous academic setting, into communities in a manner adaptable        to ""real world"" conditions by community based providers. If successful, this         research will delineate important HIV risk factors and new intervention              strategies that can be practically implemented with high-risk adolescents            within their communities.

"Enacted Stigma, Gender & Risk Behaviors of School Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and questioning (GLBQ) youth are at increased risk for health disparities, including HIV and teen pregnancy, vs. heterosexual peers, a risk attributed to the effects of nearly universal stigma for sexual minorities. Behaviors in a social group that convey or enforce stigma are enacted stigma; culture influences stigma, yet gender and ethnic variations in enacted stigma have seldom been examined among youth. Enacted stigma in school has been measured only indirectly in large-scale school-based surveys. To develop effective interventions, we need to understand enacted stigma among different cultural groups, develop culturally competent, reliable measures, and test the links between stigma and health behaviors in population-based surveys. Although GLBQ stigma is our primary focus, understanding how other types of stigma are enacted is important in developing general measures of enacted stigma. Therefore, the purpose of this 5-year, mixed-methods international study is to explore enacted stigma behaviors among indigenous, Asian-ancestry, and European-ancestry adolescents in school environments in Canada, New Zealand, and the U.S., to develop cross-cultural measures of enacted stigma for adolescent health surveys, and to examine the association of types of stigma and HIV risk behaviors among adolescents. The specific aims are:      I. To compare the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors associated with sexual orientation and other stigmatized identities among youth in existing large-scale school-based surveys, and to identify both the existing indirect measures of stigma that are risk factors plus the protective factors significantly associated with the HIV risk behaviors.      II. To identify the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors and associated risk and protective factors among indigenous adolescents--American Indian (U.S.), First Nations (Canada), Maori (New Zealand--as well as youth of Asian ancestry in each country, and to compare the patterns among adolescents of similar ethnic backgrounds in the 3 countries.      III. To explore among adolescent and adult key informants the ways stigma is understood, assigned, and enforced in the school environment, and to compare the patterns within the three countries. This exploration will be focused primarily on stigma based on sexual orientation status, but other types of stigmatized identities will be examined to understand the similarities and differences of how stigma is enacted, and the potential utility of generic stigma measures.      IV. Within each country, to elicit explanatory models from adolescents and youth workers on the survey findings of HIV risk behaviors and stigma, and to tap suggested strategies for reducing stigma and addressing sexual risk behaviors in culturally appropriate ways among GLBQ youth.      V. Incorporating the findings of aims I-IV, to develop, pilot, and psychometrically evaluate universal and country-specific culturally competent items and scales, for population-based adolescent health surveys, that measure perceived and enacted stigma in school, to allow cross-cultural comparisons of the effects of stigma among adolescents.

"Racial differences in physician-patient communication DESCRIPTION:  (Provided by the Applicant) Background: There are significant racial disparities in health care, and physician behaviors may contribute to these disparities. What little is known about racial differences in physician-patient communication suggests that white physicians are less patient centered with black patients than with white patients. Unconscious racial biases may result in less patient-centeredness which can be communicated through nonverbal channels. Aims: To examine differences in the tone of voice of physicians when they talk with white compared to black adolescents. Methods: Previously collected audiotapes of interviews occurring during a preventive health visit will be analyzed. Forty interviews between a white primary care physician and black adolescent will be randomly selected and individually matched to two interviews between the same physician and 2 white adolescents, creating 80 matched black/white pairs for analysis, Segments of the physicians' speech will be selected, content filtered and rated on several affective variables, using Thin Slice Analysis (TSA), a well established and validated method of measuring affect and emotion in physician-patient communication. It is hypothesized that physician's tone of voice when talking with black adolescents will be rated as less warm, less concerned, and more domineering, and thus less patient centered than when talking with white adolescents. Analysis: Unadjusted mean Thin Slice scores will be compared for black and white adolescents using paired T-tests. A conditional multivariate regression will be performed on the matched data in order to further refine the estimates for race. Backwards regression and propensity scores will be used to control for confounding and to increase precision. Significance: Identifying clinically significant differences in physicians' nonverbal communication with black patients compared to white patients will help to understand and address racial disparities in the quality of health care communication. Future studies will examine the relationship among these observed differences in nonverbal communication, verbal communication and outcome variables, including patient participation, satisfaction, and disparities in health care services.

"Behavioral clustering in adolescents with STDs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Though the risk for STDs among adolescents is well described, knowledge of their sexual, drug-using and social networks is less well developed. In addition, the role of behavioral and psychosocial factors in transmission of STDs and blood borne infections (BBIs) has been considered primarily on the individual level, and rarely as group phenomena. In this study, we will explore whether the networks of young persons demonstrate assortative mixing with regard to behaviors and psychosocial characteristics as a function of infection with STDs and BBIs. Our specific aims are (1.1) to compare the egocentric networks of infected and non-infected boys and girls with regard to specific behaviors, psychosocial characteristics, and types of associations; (1.2) to compare the sociograms (connected subgraphs) created by joining index respondents who have ties in common; (1.3) to compare the changes in egocentric networks and sociograms among adolescent boys and adolescent girls over time; (1.4) to estimate the relative importance of behavioral/psychosocial factors vs. network factors in the acquisition of STDs/BBIs; and (2.0) to examine the  extent to which assortative or disassortative mixing with regard to personal behaviors and psychosocial  factors in groupings of adolescents is associated with network structure and with the occurrence of  STDs/BBIs. We propose enrolling 20 boys and 20 girls, age 15 years (10 each infected and uninfected), interviewing and testing them for STDs/BBIs six times over a 3 year period, and, at every other interview, eliciting contacts according to a fixed chain link design (total N=440 at every other interview). The resulting clusters and groupings will provide the basis for testing hypotheses that relate to the specific aims, primary among which are that network structure will exert an independent influence on the probability of infection, and that ""infected clusters"" (i.e. those in which the index respondent is infected) will demonstrate a greater degree of assortative mixing with regard to behavioral and psychosocial variables than uninfected clusters.  For this purpose, we will take advantage of the fact that the intraclass correlation coefficient and the design effect derived from it measure intracluster homogeneity and are thus a direct measure of assortative mixing within clusters.

The contexts        for adolescent sexual behaviors are understudied. Preliminary work in the high       HIV/STI prevalence Lower East Side of New York City indicates that                   approximately one-third of sexually active youth, age 11-16, have had a sexual       experience in a setting where multiple partnerships, partner age disparities         and concurrent drug/alcohol use are common; one in eight sampled 11-16 year old      youth report attending such a setting. We propose a two-phase                        qualitative/quantitative quasi- longitudinal study of sexual socialization of        LES 13-22 year olds. The project aims to describe for male and female youth 1)       the perceived sexual/relational norms and perceived availability of social           contexts for sexual/relational interaction; 2) the social controls and               pressures facilitating or inhibiting entry into and operating within social          contexts; 3) the relationship of norms and pressures to reported incidents of        HIV/STI/unintended pregnancy risk; 4) develop descriptions of high- and              low-risk relationship/setting trajectories using youth's descriptions of social      labeling and other consequences of setting participation, and youth's                descriptions of status and relationship management strategies attendant on           labeling and other consequences; and 5) refine provisional theory to inform          future research and prevention interventions. Developmentally- informed social       context and influence theories underlie our provisional model. Eighty 13-22          year old African-American and Latino/a youth will be theoretically sampled to        provide understanding of social contexts (e.g., particular high-risk setting         participation, no participation). They will take part in three in-depth              interviews for the study's qualitative model-building Phase 1. In Phase 2, a         refined model will be tested using a variety of multivariate techniques and an       additional 320 youth. For those youth that report on the same settings, network      analysis can be done of settings. Given the sensitive nature of the research,        we will be guided in study protocols by a panel with expertise in research and       service to adolescents, including intervention researchers, epidemiologists,         clinicians, policy analysts, legal advisors, and parents. Dissemination of           results will alert other investigators and interventionists to risks associated      with participation in particular social contexts among this age group, and           sensitize those who work with adolescents to the influences that adolescents         encounter within social contexts.

"MENTORED CLINICAL SCIENTIST DEVELOPMENT AWARD The overall goal of this career development plan is to establish an independent research program in the epidemiology of obesity in children at the University of Rochester School of Medicine. Prevalences of overweight and obesity are rising in the United States, especially among females of low socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minorities. Pregnancy has been described as a life event in which excessive weight can be gained and subsequently retained. Thus, research and training activities will concentrate on the identification of the independent and joint determinants of gestational weight gain and post-partum weight retention in adolescents and young adults of different racial/ethnic groups as major determinants of overweight and obesity in women. The specific aims are: 1) To establish a systematic training program in adolescent nutrition and behavior, special nutritional needs of pregnant adolescents, measurement of nutritional status in pregnant and non-pregnant adolescents, statistical analysis of longitudinal and multi-level data, and measurement and analysis of community-level variables; 2) To analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal data on biological, sociodemographic, behavioral, and community-level determinants of pregnancy weight gain and post-partum weight retention m women from the New York State Regional Perinatal Data System and the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (CARDIA); 3) To design an observational prospective study of adolescents and young adults to identify the biological, behavioral, sociodemographic, psychological, and community-level determinants of pregnancy weight-gain and post-partum weight retention among racial/ethnic minorities. The proposed career development activities involve training in the measurement and interpretation of body composition; in reproductive, behavioral/mental health, and nutrition and healthy lifestyle issues in adolescents; in Responsible Conduct of Research; and in longitudinal and qualitative data analysis. At the end of the training program, the candidate will be an independent investigator in the field of pediatric nutrition epidemiology. The clinical and public health significance of this proposal are based on a report from the Institute of Medicine suggesting that African-American women and adolescents gain in the upper end of the recommended weight-gain during pregnancy, a warning in the literature as to the health risks to young adolescents of retaining weight gained during pregnancy, and a national goal of reducing health disparities among Americans. In addition, there is a scarcity of empirical longitudinal data on the differential determinants of pregnancy weight-gain and post-partum weight retention in adolescents of various socioeconomic and racial/ethnic minorities. Examining biological, sociocultural, and community-level factors that may differ among specific population subgroups becomes relevant in order to tailor strategies which prevent post-partum weight retention without threatening either the mother's or the newborn's health.  Given the adverse health effect of obesity and the difficulties involved in maintaining weight loss, primary prevention of obesity is of particular public health importance.

"Challenges of adjustment to HIV infection in adolescents  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Adolescents constitute one of the fastest growing populations of HIV-infected individuals today.  For a variety of reasons, adolescents living with HIV/AIDS constitute a population at risk for psychosocial adjustment to their illness.  First, like all adolescents with chronic diseases, they confront a variety of non-normative stresses that can increase their risk for psychological and social problems, as well as alter their development trajectories.  In addition, many of these adolescents, especially those who acquired infection through sexual practices and drug related activities, have histories of physical and sexual abuse, parental neglect, parental alcohol and substance abuse, and other significant stressors which are recognized risk factors for poor psychosocial morbidity.  Over the last decade, advances in the treatment of HIV disease have significantly extended survival, allowing most infected individuals who learn of their infection and enter treatment to now live with HIV/AIDS as a chronic disease.  Building on our previous work and given the scarcity of information about the lived experiences of HIV-infected adolescents we propose a qualitative study of 80 HIV-infected African-American and Latino youth, age 13-24 years, residing in New York City (40 males, 40 females) to assess the adaptive challenges, coping responses, the specific role of substance use in adaptive efforts and risky behavior; and how HIV infection in adolescents may interfere with the accomplishment of age-specific developmental tasks.

"Understanding Social Status' Impact on Adolescent Health   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elimination of social inequalities in                                         health is one of the overarching goals of Healthy People 2010. Most past work        has defined social status as socioeconomic status (SES), an external measure         that does not account for subjective, internalized perceptions of social             standing. Most studies also do not explain how lower social status causes            poorer health. Using a new measure of subjective social standing developed by        members of the investigative team, this study tests a novel explanatory model        of social status' impact on health. The model identifies the HPA axis and            autonomic nervous system as critical biologic systems in the creation of social      inequalities in health. Social status, an environmental stress, causes               stimulation of these systems which, in turn, leads to alterations in                 neurohormonal mediators of the social status-health relationship. The study          dovetails to a new 4-year longitudinal cohort study of adolescent obesity and        Type 2 diabetes in a racially and socioeconomically diverse school district in       Ohio. Both of these diseases support this model. The specific aims are 1 )To         describe adolescents' perceptions of social standing and the developmental           changes which occur in these perceptions over a four year period; 2) To              characterize the associations between social status, measured both objectively       and subjectively, and obesity and insulin resistance among adolescents; and 3)       To determine the relationships between social status, measured both objectively      and subjectively, and potential biologic mediators of social status' impact on       health. To address these aims, yearly assessment of adolescents' subjective          social standing will take place. In addition, in Years 1 and 4, potential            primary and secondary biologic mediators (insulin, DHEA-S, blood pressure,           total and HDL cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin) will be obtained.            Parents will provide information on SES and their own perceptions of social          standing in Years 1 and 4. This study will provide unique, community-based           information on potential biologic mediators of social status' influence on           health. The population's diversity will enable us to differentiate the effects       of race/ethnicity and social status. The innovative measurement of social            status, which includes both subjective and objective components, may explain         some of the inconsistency in the SES-obesity relationship and the secular            trends in obesity and diabetes. This work will also lay the foundation for           creation of effective primary prevention strategies by providing insight into        the processes through which social inequalities in health are created.

"Enacted Stigma, Gender & Risk Behaviors of School Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and questioning (GLBQ) youth are at increased risk for health disparities, including HIV and teen pregnancy, vs. heterosexual peers, a risk attributed to the effects of nearly universal stigma for sexual minorities. Behaviors in a social group that convey or enforce stigma are enacted stigma; culture influences stigma, yet gender and ethnic variations in enacted stigma have seldom been examined among youth. Enacted stigma in school has been measured only indirectly in large-scale school-based surveys. To develop effective interventions, we need to understand enacted stigma among different cultural groups, develop culturally competent, reliable measures, and test the links between stigma and health behaviors in population-based surveys. Although GLBQ stigma is our primary focus, understanding how other types of stigma are enacted is important in developing general measures of enacted stigma. Therefore, the purpose of this 5-year, mixed-methods international study is to explore enacted stigma behaviors among indigenous, Asian-ancestry, and European-ancestry adolescents in school environments in Canada, New Zealand, and the U.S., to develop cross-cultural measures of enacted stigma for adolescent health surveys, and to examine the association of types of stigma and HIV risk behaviors among adolescents. The specific aims are:      I. To compare the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors associated with sexual orientation and other stigmatized identities among youth in existing large-scale school-based surveys, and to identify both the existing indirect measures of stigma that are risk factors plus the protective factors significantly associated with the HIV risk behaviors.      II. To identify the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors and associated risk and protective factors among indigenous adolescents--American Indian (U.S.), First Nations (Canada), Maori (New Zealand--as well as youth of Asian ancestry in each country, and to compare the patterns among adolescents of similar ethnic backgrounds in the 3 countries.      III. To explore among adolescent and adult key informants the ways stigma is understood, assigned, and enforced in the school environment, and to compare the patterns within the three countries. This exploration will be focused primarily on stigma based on sexual orientation status, but other types of stigmatized identities will be examined to understand the similarities and differences of how stigma is enacted, and the potential utility of generic stigma measures.      IV. Within each country, to elicit explanatory models from adolescents and youth workers on the survey findings of HIV risk behaviors and stigma, and to tap suggested strategies for reducing stigma and addressing sexual risk behaviors in culturally appropriate ways among GLBQ youth.      V. Incorporating the findings of aims I-IV, to develop, pilot, and psychometrically evaluate universal and country-specific culturally competent items and scales, for population-based adolescent health surveys, that measure perceived and enacted stigma in school, to allow cross-cultural comparisons of the effects of stigma among adolescents.

"HIV PREVENTION FOR ADOLESCENTS: RESEARCH TO PRACTICE   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                                          This proposed study targeting drug abusing adolescents is a 5-year randomized        controlled trial of an Enhanced-Cognitive Behavioral HIV prevention                  intervention, augmented by components focused on Social Influence                    (Soc-Influence) and Psychiatric/Psychological (Psych) Symptoms. The primary aim      is to compare the effects of E-CB on primary outcomes (HIV risk behaviors) with      a Health Promotion Comparison (HPC) condition, matched for attention, time, and      attention value, when administered under conditions approaching ecologically         valid ""real life"" community circumstances. E-CB is considered an enhancement         over existing CB approaches because it integrates key components derived from        ""effective"" CB adolescent-specific HIV interventions, as appraised in the CDC's      Compendium of HIV Prevention Interventions, and adds components to address           Soc-Influence (parental monitoring and parent-child communication) and Psych         factors (drug abuse & psychiatric symptom severity). The proposed sample of 160      male and 160 female adolescents will be drawn from a target population of            predominantly minority, low income, culturally diverse, sexually active,             alcohol and other drug (AOD) abusing youth-a group most disproportionately           affected by HIV and other health disparities. We propose to examine how              intervention effects are 1) mediated by Attitude-Motivation-Skill variables,         Social Influence, and Psychiatric Variables and moderated by 4 key factors:          age, gender, cognitive functioning, and traumatic abuse history. HLM and SEM         procedures will be used to explore how study variables interrelate to predict        outcome. This project is significant in its response to the NIH priority on          translational research, in which HIV prevention is refocused on the adaptation       of ""effective"" interventions to reach new populations. The proposed project          further responds to the NIH priority on bridging clinical research and               practice, the emphasis is to bring interventions developed during efficacy           trials in a rigorous academic setting, into communities in a manner adaptable        to ""real world"" conditions by community based providers. If successful, this         research will delineate important HIV risk factors and new intervention              strategies that can be practically implemented with high-risk adolescents            within their communities.

"Parent Intervention in CBT for Depressed Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite progress in treating mental disorders in youth, little is known about these interventions with Latinos who are now the largest minority group in the United States. This study examines the impact of enhancing effective interventions through the involvement of parents in an 8 session of a psycho education intervention (PPI). This PPI will be incorporated into the 12-session CBT, a Cognitive Behavioral treatment method that has already been shown effective for the treatment of adolescent depression. This study will randomize 140 Latino adolescents with Major Depression to CBT with or without a PPI delivered in groups. Intake diagnoses will be obtained via structured diagnostic interviews (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-DISC for adolescents and Composite International Diagnostic Interview-CIDI for parents). The study will focus on Puerto Rican adolescents and their parents. The primary aims address both the efficacy and effectiveness of the intervention and treatments. Efficacy questions focus on the comparison of the active treatment with and without the PPI for reducing depressive symptoms and diagnosis (DISC) after 12 weeks of treatment and for preventing relapse over the course of one year post-treatment (DISC). Effectiveness questions focus on the impact of the treatment with or without the PPI on broader functional outcomes. Patient functional outcomes include general functioning status, family functioning, school attendance, and attrition rates. The relative value of CBT with and without the adjunctive parent intervention for improved parent functioning regarding psychiatric distress and symptoms, burden of patient illness, and work attendance will be examined. We hypothesize that the active treatment with PPI will be superior to no PPI in reducing depression at post treatment. Because the PPI is designed to involve parents and thus impact other aspects of the family system, this treatment is expected to produce better outcomes in several of the functional domains. To test the theoretical assumptions of the intervention, we also aim to examine the contribution of hypothesized treatment-specific change mechanisms to mediate the short-term outcome and predict long-term relapse over one year. This study responds to NIH and NIMH initiatives on decreasing disparities in health and mental health care between minorities and White populations and will contribute to our knowledge base.         ",Parent Intervention in CBT for Depressed Latino Youth,6777281,R01MH067893,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' clinical trial ', ' relapse /recurrence ', ' family structure /dynamics ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' mental disorder prevention ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' mental disorder diagnosis ', ' major depression ', ' Hispanic American ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' functional ability ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' patient oriented research ', ' mental health education ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO RIO PIEDRAS,R01,2004,388592,0.01208948216580988
"Maintaining HIV Prevention Gains in Female Adolescents DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is the only age category where the number of females becoming infected with HIV outnumber the number of males.  Despite these data, only four randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of a gender-specific HIV-risk reduction program for adolescent females.  The proposed research aims to address this gap in HIV prevention science, and will evaluate the short and longer-term efficacy of an HIV prevention intervention for adolescent girls.  We will recruit 640 adolescent females aged 15 to 19 years from family planning clinics and randomly assign them to one of two conditions: (a) an HIV-risk reduction intervention based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model (Fisher & Fisher, 1992); or, (b) a structurally equivalent health promotion control group (CTL), both supplemented by booster sessions at three and six months.  At a short-term (three-month) follow up, we hypothesize that IMB participants will increase HIV related knowledge, motivation, and behavioral skills, and decrease the frequency of risky sexual practices relative to CTL participants.  We will reassess all participants at six and 12 months to evaluate the longer-term efficacy of the interventions.  At these longer-term follow-ups, we hypothesize that IMB participants will demonstrate higher levels of HIV knowledge, motivation, and behavioral skills; decreased risky sexual practices; and decreased rates of STDs (chlamydia, gonorrhea) relative to the CTL participants.  The final aim of the proposed research is to determine whether the constructs in the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) Model (Fisher & Fisher, 1992), can account for variability in HIV-related behavior.  We hypothesize that preventive behavior at six and 12 months will be a function of a participant's HIV-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills at the three-month follow up, and that information and motivation will be partially mediated by behavioral skills to influence the initiation and maintenance of HIV preventive behavior.  The long-term intent of the proposed research is to develop a risk reduction program that can be used by community-based health organizations to reduce the risk of HIV infection among adolescent females.

"Sexual Orientation and Health Disparities in Adolescence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healthy People 2010, the nation's essential document for setting the national agenda for health, identifies the persistence of health disparities across communities to be among the leading health challenges of our era. Recent studies suggest that the health of the nation's adolescent population may be patterned in important ways by sexual orientation group disparities. Depressive symptoms and low self-esteem have been proposed as underlying vulnerabilities driving elevated rates of risk behaviors in sexual minority adolescents. Rosario et al. propose a psychosocial Coming Out Process (COP) Model for adolescents in which dimensions of the process are linked with health behaviors. Additionally, drawing on Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), we propose that social norms in lesbian/bisexual female (LB) and gay/bisexual male (GB) communities also influence both positively and negatively health behaviors of sexual minority youth through processes of social learning. Family environment, an adolescent's age at the time of coming out, and presence or absence of preexisting psychosocial distress may be important factors influencing a young person's resiliency or risk and their experience with the coming out process. Research is needed to explore important predictors of the process of coming out and how this process relates to health behavior.       We will examine sexual orientation in association with weight concerns, disordered weight control behaviors, binge eating, and tobacco and alcohol use in adolescent girls and boys in the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), a longitudinal cohort study of 16,882 adolescents living across the U.S. In addition, we will examine factors that underlie the coming out process in adolescence, leading some to be more resilient while others have greater difficulties. Our specific aims are to compare the prevalence and severity over 4 years of follow-up of weight concerns and tobacco and alcohol use across sexual orientation groups among adolescent girls and boys and to empirically test the application of the COP Model and SCT to understand sexual orientation group disparities in health. We will examine prospectively the contribution of components of the COP Model and SCT in their relation to psychological distress and factors linked with LB and GB community social norms and orientation group differences in health outcomes.

"MENTORED CLINICAL SCIENTIST DEVELOPMENT AWARD The overall goal of this career development plan is to establish an independent research program in the epidemiology of obesity in children at the University of Rochester School of Medicine. Prevalences of overweight and obesity are rising in the United States, especially among females of low socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minorities. Pregnancy has been described as a life event in which excessive weight can be gained and subsequently retained. Thus, research and training activities will concentrate on the identification of the independent and joint determinants of gestational weight gain and post-partum weight retention in adolescents and young adults of different racial/ethnic groups as major determinants of overweight and obesity in women. The specific aims are: 1) To establish a systematic training program in adolescent nutrition and behavior, special nutritional needs of pregnant adolescents, measurement of nutritional status in pregnant and non-pregnant adolescents, statistical analysis of longitudinal and multi-level data, and measurement and analysis of community-level variables; 2) To analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal data on biological, sociodemographic, behavioral, and community-level determinants of pregnancy weight gain and post-partum weight retention m women from the New York State Regional Perinatal Data System and the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (CARDIA); 3) To design an observational prospective study of adolescents and young adults to identify the biological, behavioral, sociodemographic, psychological, and community-level determinants of pregnancy weight-gain and post-partum weight retention among racial/ethnic minorities. The proposed career development activities involve training in the measurement and interpretation of body composition; in reproductive, behavioral/mental health, and nutrition and healthy lifestyle issues in adolescents; in Responsible Conduct of Research; and in longitudinal and qualitative data analysis. At the end of the training program, the candidate will be an independent investigator in the field of pediatric nutrition epidemiology. The clinical and public health significance of this proposal are based on a report from the Institute of Medicine suggesting that African-American women and adolescents gain in the upper end of the recommended weight-gain during pregnancy, a warning in the literature as to the health risks to young adolescents of retaining weight gained during pregnancy, and a national goal of reducing health disparities among Americans. In addition, there is a scarcity of empirical longitudinal data on the differential determinants of pregnancy weight-gain and post-partum weight retention in adolescents of various socioeconomic and racial/ethnic minorities. Examining biological, sociocultural, and community-level factors that may differ among specific population subgroups becomes relevant in order to tailor strategies which prevent post-partum weight retention without threatening either the mother's or the newborn's health.  Given the adverse health effect of obesity and the difficulties involved in maintaining weight loss, primary prevention of obesity is of particular public health importance.

"Adolescent HIV Risk-Social settings & Prevention Issues   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent HIV or STI clusters in youth are         associated with a particular social context for sexual behavior. The contexts        for adolescent sexual behaviors are understudied. Preliminary work in the high       HIV/STI prevalence Lower East Side of New York City indicates that                   approximately one-third of sexually active youth, age 11-16, have had a sexual       experience in a setting where multiple partnerships, partner age disparities         and concurrent drug/alcohol use are common; one in eight sampled 11-16 year old      youth report attending such a setting. We propose a two-phase                        qualitative/quantitative quasi- longitudinal study of sexual socialization of        LES 13-22 year olds. The project aims to describe for male and female youth 1)       the perceived sexual/relational norms and perceived availability of social           contexts for sexual/relational interaction; 2) the social controls and               pressures facilitating or inhibiting entry into and operating within social          contexts; 3) the relationship of norms and pressures to reported incidents of        HIV/STI/unintended pregnancy risk; 4) develop descriptions of high- and              low-risk relationship/setting trajectories using youth's descriptions of social      labeling and other consequences of setting participation, and youth's                descriptions of status and relationship management strategies attendant on           labeling and other consequences; and 5) refine provisional theory to inform          future research and prevention interventions. Developmentally- informed social       context and influence theories underlie our provisional model. Eighty 13-22          year old African-American and Latino/a youth will be theoretically sampled to        provide understanding of social contexts (e.g., particular high-risk setting         participation, no participation). They will take part in three in-depth              interviews for the study's qualitative model-building Phase 1. In Phase 2, a         refined model will be tested using a variety of multivariate techniques and an       additional 320 youth. For those youth that report on the same settings, network      analysis can be done of settings. Given the sensitive nature of the research,        we will be guided in study protocols by a panel with expertise in research and       service to adolescents, including intervention researchers, epidemiologists,         clinicians, policy analysts, legal advisors, and parents. Dissemination of           results will alert other investigators and interventionists to risks associated      with participation in particular social contexts among this age group, and           sensitize those who work with adolescents to the influences that adolescents         encounter within social contexts.

"Stigma, Social Structure, and Adolescent Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a request for a dissertation research grant (PAR-03-110) designed to encourage minority doctoral candidates to pursue research careers in mental health. The proposed dissertation research employs a social structural framework to explain why adolescents with same-gender attractions are at higher risk of mental health problems than adolescents with opposite-gender attractions. Specifically, sociological studies demonstrate that features of social structure such as social networks and social support from families and peers affect mental health outcomes. This study examines the premise that the experience of being an adolescent with same-gender attractions leads to stigmatizing social network and social support experiences, which in turn produce a high risk of mental health problems. The dissertation aims to: (1) describe and compare the social networks and social support of adolescents with same-gender attractions and adolescents with opposite-gender attractions as they contribute to mental health disparities; (2) examine how social status variations in social support (specifically based on age, gender, and race) among adolescents with same-gender attractions contribute to social status variations in mental health; (3) examine how the process of identifying with an attraction toward the same gender influences social support, which in turn affects mental health. To accomplish these aims, the proposed research will use a sample of adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Adolescents from grades 7 to 12 were initially interviewed in 1995 with two follow-up interviews in 1996 and 2001-2002. The longitudinal design of this dataset makes it possible to document stability and change in gender attraction, in the structure and quality of relationships to family members and peer groups, and in mental health status during the transition to adulthood. Linear regression, structural equation modeling, and social network analysis will be used to estimate the relationships between social structure, gender attraction, and mental health status across time. The study improves our understanding of the social structural arrangements that produce mental health disparities between adolescents with same-gender attractions and adolescents with opposite-gender attractions. Research findings can be used to develop intervention strategies at the group and community levels to reduce mental health problems among adolescents with same-gender attractions.         ","Stigma, Social Structure, and Adolescent Mental Health",6795608,R36MH071135,"['child psychology ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' family structure /dynamics ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' mental health epidemiology ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' psychological test ', ' attitude ', ' prejudice ', ' homosexual ', ' depression ', ' suicide ', ' social group process ', ' peer group ', ' psychosocial separation ', ' gender difference ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' social support network ', ' psychological stressor ', ' substance abuse ', ' age difference ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' heterosexual ', ' ']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R36,2004,32400,0.00554331921564325
"Anger Assessment and Intervention in Rural Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today's adolescents are living in violent times. The impending war with Iraq, the events of September 11, 2001, and the nations high terror alert prey upon adolescents' coping. The three leading causes of death among adolescents: injuries, homicide, and suicide, all have one thing in common, anger. Unattended anger often leads to violence, a pervasive problem among our nation's teens. An escalation in violence such as that seen in the tragedies at Columbine, Jonesboro, and other rural communities has made instituting coping strategies among this population essential. This project, Teaching Kids to Cope with Anger (TKC-A) is a school based behavioral intervention that addresses anger as a potential signal that may lead to problem behaviors in youth, especially those who live in rural areas for whom access to support is limited. One in six rural families live in poverty; high unemployment, bioterrorism, and other economic pressures put stress on teens, leading to increased risk for anxiety, depression, alcohol and substance use, delinquency, school failure, poor relations with peers, and loss of self esteem. It is no surprise; therefore, that youth who reside in rural areas are susceptible to anger management difficulties, which are compounded by a lack of access to mental health services that are typical of their communities. The goal of this study is to provide an intervention targeting anger as a factor that contributes to high-risk behavior for youth living in rural areas. TKC-A consists of eight one-hour interactive sessions that are led by a trained group leader. Coping skills are taught and practiced through role-playing, group projects, discussions, brainstorming, and handouts. The TKC-A targets freshman, sophomore, and junior level students who attend rural high schools in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Specific aims are to (1) describe anger experience, anger expression and its potential correlates (depressive symptoms, coping strategies, perceived social support, drug use, self-esteem, optimism, anxiety, life events, disciplinary actions, and demographic characteristics; (2) examine the relationship between anger and its potential correlates; and (3) evaluate the effect of the intervention. The intervention reduces a health disparity by providing a service for rural youth.

"Challenges of adjustment to HIV infection in adolescents  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Adolescents constitute one of the fastest growing populations of HIV-infected individuals today.  For a variety of reasons, adolescents living with HIV/AIDS constitute a population at risk for psychosocial adjustment to their illness.  First, like all adolescents with chronic diseases, they confront a variety of non-normative stresses that can increase their risk for psychological and social problems, as well as alter their development trajectories.  In addition, many of these adolescents, especially those who acquired infection through sexual practices and drug related activities, have histories of physical and sexual abuse, parental neglect, parental alcohol and substance abuse, and other significant stressors which are recognized risk factors for poor psychosocial morbidity.  Over the last decade, advances in the treatment of HIV disease have significantly extended survival, allowing most infected individuals who learn of their infection and enter treatment to now live with HIV/AIDS as a chronic disease.  Building on our previous work and given the scarcity of information about the lived experiences of HIV-infected adolescents we propose a qualitative study of 80 HIV-infected African-American and Latino youth, age 13-24 years, residing in New York City (40 males, 40 females) to assess the adaptive challenges, coping responses, the specific role of substance use in adaptive efforts and risky behavior; and how HIV infection in adolescents may interfere with the accomplishment of age-specific developmental tasks.

"Teen Males Reproductive Health Needs & Barriers to Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the U.S, teen males, especially older and minority adolescent males, engage in sexual risk behaviors that result in reproductive problems among adolescents of both genders, including sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy. Efforts to promote safe sexual behaviors have been shown to be effective to prevent such morbidity and should start ideally during adolescence. Practice guidelines recommend that clinicians promote reproductive health among all adolescents, such as screening and counseling about sex and its consequences. Current efforts however target primarily females. We know very little about how to effectively promote reproductive health for males or how males think about their reproductive health needs. This is especially relevant since boys' use of health care declines during adolescence, which can ultimately result in unmet health needs. The ultimate goal of this study is to better understand adolescent males' perceived reproductive health needs in context of their general needs and identify those factors that are amenable to change in order to inform the development of adolescent male reproductive health intervention programs.  The candidate is a pediatrician and specialist in adolescent medicine at the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) who has conducted preliminary research on adolescent males. The training phase of the award will include 5 activities:  1) to learn how to develop study measures for behavioral research, 2) to develop further skills in data collection, including semi-structured patient-oriented interviews, 3) to learn how to design and analyze longitudinal studies, 4) to develop skills in the responsible conduct of research, and 5) to refine skills in presenting, publishing and grant writing.  These objectives will be accomplished through mentored research activities, and complemented by focused coursework available through an existing UMB K30 award for training of clinical investigators. The research phase of the award includes a description of adolescent males' (ages 12-19) actual and perceived reproductive health needs, reproductive health care use, predictors of care use, and reproductive health morbidity by using an existing dataset and primary data collection. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health, Aim 1 of this study is to determine the extent to which adolescent males have reproductive health needs and the factors that predict reproductive health care use. Using primary data collection and analysis among adolescent males, parents and clinical experts, Aim 2 of this study is to explore adolescent males' perceived general and reproductive health needs and experiences with the health care system. Upon completion of this award, the candidate will become a rigorous behavioral scientist informed by his clinical orientation and enrich our understanding of domestic adolescent males' reproductive health and mechanisms by which to increase their access to clinical reproductive services.

"A Multilevel HIV-Prevention Strategy for High-Risk Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This multisite project provides a unique test of a multilevel HIV/STD prevention strategy for high-risk youth.  A total of 1600 African American adolescents, ages 12-16, will be recruited through CBOs in 4 cities, two in the Northeast (Providence and Syracuse) and two in the Southeast (Columbia and Macon), to participate in this HIV/STD prevention trial.  Adolescents will complete a baseline ACASI administered survey to assess their attitudes, beliefs and sexual behaviors, and provide a urine specimen for detection of three prevalent STDs.  Following baseline assessment, all adolescents will be randomly assigned to receive either the Focus on Kids HIV-prevention intervention or a General Health Promotion control. Subsequently, adolescents will be followed longitudinally and complete similar assessments at 6-, 12- and 18-months follow-up.  The second level of intervention involves tailored HIV/STD prevention messages through local mass media.  One city in each regional city-pair will be randomly assigned to receive the HIV prevention media campaign while the other city will serve as a control city (no media campaign).  Thus, the media messages will be directed to African American youth in only one of the two cities in each geographic region. The media program will deliver HIV-prevention messages that are culturally sensitive and age appropriate; these programs will promote both abstinence and risk reduction practices.  Cross-sectional surveys of 1200 African American youth using random-digit-dialing telephone interviews in the two cities that receive the media campaign and the two media control cities will be conducted over a 30-month period to determine the community-wide effects of the HIV media campaign.  This design will enable a test of the joint and separate effects of the two interventions over an 18-month follow-up for the youth participating in the small-group interventions.  In addition, the media campaign is predicted to independently enhance adolescents' adoption of HIV-preventive attitudes, beliefs and behaviors on a community-wide basis compared to youth in the non-media control cities.  Causal modeling methodology will be employed to assess the effects of the two levels of intervention and to identify the role of supportive messages received through the media and from peers that are predicted to maintain safer sexual behavior as adolescents mature.         ",A Multilevel HIV-Prevention Strategy for High-Risk Youth,6842169,U01MH066785,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' sexually transmitted disease ', ' cooperative study ', ' AIDS education /prevention ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' human subject ', ' information dissemination ', ' mass information media ', ' interview ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' sex behavior ', ' small social group ', ' African American ', ' community ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' safe sex /sex abstinence ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,U01,2004,185078,0.07988026471049575
"ADHD: Detection and Service Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a chronic, often lifelong, psychiatric disorder with onset in early childhood. ADHD treatment disparities for affected African-American youth and for girls have been consistently documented, but the contributing factors in the help-seeking process are poorly understood.  The Institute of Medicine, in its recent recommendations on improving quality of care, stresses the importance of ensuring that patient values guide clinical interventions.  This competing renewal seeks to follow a cohort of youth into their adolescent years and to conduct a parallel quantitative and qualitative study to achieve the following three objectives:  1) To test three sets of hypotheses addressing predictors of continuities or discontinuities of ADHD treatment status from childhood to adolescence, and relevant adolescent outcomes on multiple levels (symptoms, functioning, consumer perspectives, environments, and systems).  2) The qualitative study component seeks to describe elements and experiences that have helped or hindered help-seeking for ADHD for two underserved groups: girls and African-American youth with ADHD.  Special emphasis will be given to the interplay between ADHD knowledge, the social network consultation process, and values and treatment preferences, to identify interventions aimed at reducing treatment disparities that respect patient values.  3) Intervention options identified in the qualitative study, along with professional treatment guidelines, will be tested for acceptability, feasibility, and perceived benefit in a survey to the entire cohort and randomly selected health and education professionals.   To achieve Objective 1, a longitudinal observational study, collecting parent, youth and teacher data will be conducted among a high-risk cohort of youth that have already been followed over the past 4 years.  The first two study phases will focus on treatment continuity and discontinuity in adolescence, and the last phase on outcomes.  For this last phase, a matched group of low-risk youth will be recruited from the original screening cohort of our first study.  To achieve Objective 2, experience sampling method (ESM) with eight youth, their parents and teachers will be used to develop themes and questions for 10 focus groups (FG), four for parents, four for youths, and two for teachers.  Cohort participants will be sampled for ESM and FG based on criterion sampling (ADHD treatment status, gender, and race).  Feedback forums after each data collection phase will enhance validity and trustworthiness of findings.  A framework of critical theory will guide open coding, domain analysis, critical incident method and political analysis, which represent the qualitative data analysis methods used in this study.  In addition, the focus will be on perceived beneficial steps that could be taken to improve the help-seeking experience from the perspectives of the youth, parents, and teachers, culminating in a summary of suggested intervention options to improve equitable access to treatment.  For Objective 3, these intervention options, along with a summary of professional treatment guidelines for ADHD, will be presented to the entire study cohort, school district teachers, and medical treatment providers in the form of a survey for assessment of acceptability, feasibility, and perceived benefits.  Survey findings will be processed in feedback forums in preparation of pilot interventions.  The study occurs in partnership with the school district and an advisory board of school professionals, parents, and youth.  The research team has an extensive track record of success with similar study designs and will use innovative technologies to adhere to an efficient management plan.

"Behavioral clustering in adolescents with STDs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Though the risk for STDs among adolescents is well described, knowledge of their sexual, drug-using and social networks is less well developed. In addition, the role of behavioral and psychosocial factors in transmission of STDs and blood borne infections (BBIs) has been considered primarily on the individual level, and rarely as group phenomena. In this study, we will explore whether the networks of young persons demonstrate assortative mixing with regard to behaviors and psychosocial characteristics as a function of infection with STDs and BBIs. Our specific aims are (1.1) to compare the egocentric networks of infected and non-infected boys and girls with regard to specific behaviors, psychosocial characteristics, and types of associations; (1.2) to compare the sociograms (connected subgraphs) created by joining index respondents who have ties in common; (1.3) to compare the changes in egocentric networks and sociograms among adolescent boys and adolescent girls over time; (1.4) to estimate the relative importance of behavioral/psychosocial factors vs. network factors in the acquisition of STDs/BBIs; and (2.0) to examine the  extent to which assortative or disassortative mixing with regard to personal behaviors and psychosocial  factors in groupings of adolescents is associated with network structure and with the occurrence of  STDs/BBIs. We propose enrolling 20 boys and 20 girls, age 15 years (10 each infected and uninfected), interviewing and testing them for STDs/BBIs six times over a 3 year period, and, at every other interview, eliciting contacts according to a fixed chain link design (total N=440 at every other interview). The resulting clusters and groupings will provide the basis for testing hypotheses that relate to the specific aims, primary among which are that network structure will exert an independent influence on the probability of infection, and that ""infected clusters"" (i.e. those in which the index respondent is infected) will demonstrate a greater degree of assortative mixing with regard to behavioral and psychosocial variables than uninfected clusters.  For this purpose, we will take advantage of the fact that the intraclass correlation coefficient and the design effect derived from it measure intracluster homogeneity and are thus a direct measure of assortative mixing within clusters. Demonstration of such phenomena will be of use in designing interventions that incorporate network information into their formulation.           ",Behavioral clustering in adolescents with STDs,6699941,R01HD043678,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' sexually transmitted disease ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' sex behavior ', ' social behavior ', ' psychometrics ', ' gender difference ', ' African American ', ' social support network ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' substance abuse related behavior ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,499636,0.09845550870973445
"Stigma, Social Structure, and Adolescent Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a request for a dissertation research grant (PAR-03-110) designed to encourage minority doctoral candidates to pursue research careers in mental health. The proposed dissertation research employs a social structural framework to explain why adolescents with same-gender attractions are at higher risk of mental health problems than adolescents with opposite-gender attractions. Specifically, sociological studies demonstrate that features of social structure such as social networks and social support from families and peers affect mental health outcomes. This study examines the premise that the experience of being an adolescent with same-gender attractions leads to stigmatizing social network and social support experiences, which in turn produce a high risk of mental health problems. The dissertation aims to: (1) describe and compare the social networks and social support of adolescents with same-gender attractions and adolescents with opposite-gender attractions as they contribute to mental health disparities; (2) examine how social status variations in social support (specifically based on age, gender, and race) among adolescents with same-gender attractions contribute to social status variations in mental health; (3) examine how the process of identifying with an attraction toward the same gender influences social support, which in turn affects mental health. To accomplish these aims, the proposed research will use a sample of adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Adolescents from grades 7 to 12 were initially interviewed in 1995 with two follow-up interviews in 1996 and 2001-2002. The longitudinal design of this dataset makes it possible to document stability and change in gender attraction, in the structure and quality of relationships to family members and peer groups, and in mental health status during the transition to adulthood. Linear regression, structural equation modeling, and social network analysis will be used to estimate the relationships between social structure, gender attraction, and mental health status across time. The study improves our understanding of the social structural arrangements that produce mental health disparities between adolescents with same-gender attractions and adolescents with opposite-gender attractions. Research findings can be used to develop intervention strategies at the group and community levels to reduce mental health problems among adolescents with same-gender attractions.         ","Stigma, Social Structure, and Adolescent Mental Health",6863767,R36MH071135,"['child psychology ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' family structure /dynamics ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' mental health epidemiology ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' psychological test ', ' attitude ', ' prejudice ', ' homosexual ', ' depression ', ' suicide ', ' social group process ', ' peer group ', ' psychosocial separation ', ' gender difference ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' social support network ', ' psychological stressor ', ' substance abuse related disorder ', ' age difference ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' heterosexual ', ' ']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R36,2005,27048,0.00554331921564325
"Adolescent HIV Risk-Social settings & Prevention Issues   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent HIV or STI clusters in youth are         associated with a particular social context for sexual behavior. The contexts        for adolescent sexual behaviors are understudied. Preliminary work in the high       HIV/STI prevalence Lower East Side of New York City indicates that                   approximately one-third of sexually active youth, age 11-16, have had a sexual       experience in a setting where multiple partnerships, partner age disparities         and concurrent drug/alcohol use are common; one in eight sampled 11-16 year old      youth report attending such a setting. We propose a two-phase                        qualitative/quantitative quasi- longitudinal study of sexual socialization of        LES 13-22 year olds. The project aims to describe for male and female youth 1)       the perceived sexual/relational norms and perceived availability of social           contexts for sexual/relational interaction; 2) the social controls and               pressures facilitating or inhibiting entry into and operating within social          contexts; 3) the relationship of norms and pressures to reported incidents of        HIV/STI/unintended pregnancy risk; 4) develop descriptions of high- and              low-risk relationship/setting trajectories using youth's descriptions of social      labeling and other consequences of setting participation, and youth's                descriptions of status and relationship management strategies attendant on           labeling and other consequences; and 5) refine provisional theory to inform          future research and prevention interventions. Developmentally- informed social       context and influence theories underlie our provisional model. Eighty 13-22          year old African-American and Latino/a youth will be theoretically sampled to        provide understanding of social contexts (e.g., particular high-risk setting         participation, no participation). They will take part in three in-depth              interviews for the study's qualitative model-building Phase 1. In Phase 2, a         refined model will be tested using a variety of multivariate techniques and an       additional 320 youth. For those youth that report on the same settings, network      analysis can be done of settings. Given the sensitive nature of the research,        we will be guided in study protocols by a panel with expertise in research and       service to adolescents, including intervention researchers, epidemiologists,         clinicians, policy analysts, legal advisors, and parents. Dissemination of           results will alert other investigators and interventionists to risks associated      with participation in particular social contexts among this age group, and           sensitize those who work with adolescents to the influences that adolescents         encounter within social contexts.

"A Community-Academic Partnership to Address Disparities*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  As outlined in Healthy People 2010, eliminating health disparities, especially with respect to child obesity, is a major U.S. goal.  Obesity rates among youth have been rising dramatically in recent years, with a concomitant rise in the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  In Los Angles County, the site of our proposed study, the prevalence of obesity among African-American and Latino teenagers is about 50% higher than for White teenagers; available data for Asian/Pacific Islander youth also suggest disparities.  Limited physical activity and poor diet contribute to obesity and are prevalent among youth from all racial/ethnic groups, but especially among African Americans and Latinos.  We propose a three-year community-based participatory research project to develop and pilot test an intervention that addresses racial/ethnic disparities in obesity among adolescents in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).  We aim to (1) build a strong community-academic partnership and assess community needs and priorities for obesity-related programs among adolescents through effective collaboration among LAUSD staff, researchers, and key community stakeholders; (2.) jointly design a pilot intervention to reduce/prevent obesity among adolescents of diverse race/ethnicity through such potential strategies as increasing physical activity and/or healthy eating behaviors; and (3) pilot test the feasibility and effects of the intervention among adolescents of diverse race/ethnicity.  To accomplish these aims, we will build upon an existing collaboration among LAUSD, the UCLA/RAND Center for Adolescent Health Promotion, and stakeholders in an ethnically and racially-diverse community-the Carson-Wilmington area of LA. LAUSD and community stakeholders have identified addressing adolescent obesity as a high priority. We will conduct extensive formative work, including qualitative interviews, focus groups, site visits, and surveys with community stakeholders, to assess priorities and potential strategies for addressing adolescent obesity; we will use this information to design and pilot test an intervention uniquely tailored to the community.  We anticipate revising the intervention based on pilot results and seeking additional funds to conduct a full evaluation throughout LAUSD.  We also anticipate that the community-academic partnership and infrastructure developed during this process will allow us to continue to collaborate in addressing health disparities facing the youth of LA.         ",A Community-Academic Partnership to Address Disparities*,7057655,R24MD001648,[''],NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R24,2005,710014,0.11967475554002055
"Maintaining HIV Prevention Gains in Female Adolescents DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is the only age category where the number of females becoming infected with HIV outnumber the number of males.  Despite these data, only four randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of a gender-specific HIV-risk reduction program for adolescent females.  The proposed research aims to address this gap in HIV prevention science, and will evaluate the short and longer-term efficacy of an HIV prevention intervention for adolescent girls.  We will recruit 640 adolescent females aged 15 to 19 years from family planning clinics and randomly assign them to one of two conditions: (a) an HIV-risk reduction intervention based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model (Fisher & Fisher, 1992); or, (b) a structurally equivalent health promotion control group (CTL), both supplemented by booster sessions at three and six months.  At a short-term (three-month) follow up, we hypothesize that IMB participants will increase HIV related knowledge, motivation, and behavioral skills, and decrease the frequency of risky sexual practices relative to CTL participants.  We will reassess all participants at six and 12 months to evaluate the longer-term efficacy of the interventions.  At these longer-term follow-ups, we hypothesize that IMB participants will demonstrate higher levels of HIV knowledge, motivation, and behavioral skills; decreased risky sexual practices; and decreased rates of STDs (chlamydia, gonorrhea) relative to the CTL participants.  The final aim of the proposed research is to determine whether the constructs in the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) Model (Fisher & Fisher, 1992), can account for variability in HIV-related behavior.  We hypothesize that preventive behavior at six and 12 months will be a function of a participant's HIV-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills at the three-month follow up, and that information and motivation will be partially mediated by behavioral skills to influence the initiation and maintenance of HIV preventive behavior.  The long-term intent of the proposed research is to develop a risk reduction program that can be used by community-based health organizations to reduce the risk of HIV infection among adolescent females.

"Race, Obesity and Enteroinsular Axis in Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    My career goals are focused upon two concurrent diseases, childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, affecting prominently adolescents of minority groups. Identifying new etiopathogenic mechanisms that explain the racial disparity and the potential influence of racial and lifestyle factors on predicting treatment outcomes are my long-term goals. With this focus, I am committed to patient-oriented translational research but I need to acquire specific skills that allow me to be more effective in this area. This award will allow me to accomplish these goals in the following way. I will: 1) enhance my statistical and epidemiological foundation; 2) develop skills in methodology, measurements, and analysis of epidemiological data; 3) develop the necessary knowledge in preventive medicine, pharmacoepidemiology and bioinformatics necessary for implementing interventional studies based on the experience gained in my training and the preliminary results of the proposed project. In obese African-American (AA) subjects, we have proposed that increased GLP-1 levels [marker of enteroinsular axis activity (EIA)] could promote adipogenesis and the development of comorbidities. It is still unclear whether these racial differences in EIA are determined by age, severity of overweight, differences in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) or autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulation. We will assess these three interrelated areas (EIA, CRF, and ANS modulation) in a biracial sample of wide-ranging overweight adolescents. In particular, we are interested in the relation between EIA activity and insulin dynamics as a potential mechanistic pathway to explain the increased prevalence of obesity, type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in AA youth. Therefore, we will determine the associations among EIA, CRF, glucose homeostasis, and risk factors for ICVD in adolescents. The results of this study can be translated into medical practice changes and may help   to implement a more physiologically effective approach to obesity treatment in AA adolescents, in particular.         ","Race, Obesity and Enteroinsular Axis in Adolescents",6863827,K23RR020788,"['body composition ', ' obesity ', ' glucose tolerance test ', ' blood chemistry ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' insulin sensitivity /resistance ', ' noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus ', ' hormone regulation /control mechanism ', ' physical fitness ', ' heart rate ', ' human subject ', ' autonomic nervous system ', ' insulin ', ' pancreatic islet function ', ' oxygen consumption ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' photon absorptiometry ', ' incretin hormone ', ' clinical research ', ' patient oriented research ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,K23,2005,134619,0.03490574546060127
"HIV PREVENTION FOR ADOLESCENTS: RESEARCH TO PRACTICE   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                                          This proposed study targeting drug abusing adolescents is a 5-year randomized        controlled trial of an Enhanced-Cognitive Behavioral HIV prevention                  intervention, augmented by components focused on Social Influence                    (Soc-Influence) and Psychiatric/Psychological (Psych) Symptoms. The primary aim      is to compare the effects of E-CB on primary outcomes (HIV risk behaviors) with      a Health Promotion Comparison (HPC) condition, matched for attention, time, and      attention value, when administered under conditions approaching ecologically         valid ""real life"" community circumstances. E-CB is considered an enhancement         over existing CB approaches because it integrates key components derived from        ""effective"" CB adolescent-specific HIV interventions, as appraised in the CDC's      Compendium of HIV Prevention Interventions, and adds components to address           Soc-Influence (parental monitoring and parent-child communication) and Psych         factors (drug abuse & psychiatric symptom severity). The proposed sample of 160      male and 160 female adolescents will be drawn from a target population of            predominantly minority, low income, culturally diverse, sexually active,             alcohol and other drug (AOD) abusing youth-a group most disproportionately           affected by HIV and other health disparities. We propose to examine how              intervention effects are 1) mediated by Attitude-Motivation-Skill variables,         Social Influence, and Psychiatric Variables and moderated by 4 key factors:          age, gender, cognitive functioning, and traumatic abuse history. HLM and SEM         procedures will be used to explore how study variables interrelate to predict        outcome. This project is significant in its response to the NIH priority on          translational research, in which HIV prevention is refocused on the adaptation       of ""effective"" interventions to reach new populations. The proposed project          further responds to the NIH priority on bridging clinical research and               practice, the emphasis is to bring interventions developed during efficacy           trials in a rigorous academic setting, into communities in a manner adaptable        to ""real world"" conditions by community based providers.

It is particularly important to understand why minority adolescents living in resource-poor communities are vulnerable to STIs in the light of the inability of individual-level factors to fully explain disease risk in this population. This study aims 1) to identify sexual networks features that are associated with individual-level STI risk, controlling for individual-level demographic and behavioral risk factors, 2) to identify neighborhood level socioeconomic characteristics that are associated with individual-level STI risk, and 3) to determine if network- and individual-level characteristics mediate the relationship between neighborhood-level socioeconomic context and individual-level disease risk.

"ADHD: Detection and Service Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a chronic, often lifelong, psychiatric disorder with onset in early childhood. ADHD treatment disparities for affected African-American youth and for girls have been consistently documented, but the contributing factors in the help-seeking process are poorly understood.  The Institute of Medicine, in its recent recommendations on improving quality of care, stresses the importance of ensuring that patient values guide clinical interventions.  This competing renewal seeks to follow a cohort of youth into their adolescent years and to conduct a parallel quantitative and qualitative study to achieve the following three objectives:  1) To test three sets of hypotheses addressing predictors of continuities or discontinuities of ADHD treatment status from childhood to adolescence, and relevant adolescent outcomes on multiple levels (symptoms, functioning, consumer perspectives, environments, and systems).  2) The qualitative study component seeks to describe elements and experiences that have helped or hindered help-seeking for ADHD for two underserved groups: girls and African-American youth with ADHD.  Special emphasis will be given to the interplay between ADHD knowledge, the social network consultation process, and values and treatment preferences, to identify interventions aimed at reducing treatment disparities that respect patient values.  3) Intervention options identified in the qualitative study, along with professional treatment guidelines, will be tested for acceptability, feasibility, and perceived benefit in a survey to the entire cohort and randomly selected health and education professionals.   To achieve Objective 1, a longitudinal observational study, collecting parent, youth and teacher data will be conducted among a high-risk cohort of youth that have already been followed over the past 4 years.  The first two study phases will focus on treatment continuity and discontinuity in adolescence, and the last phase on outcomes.  For this last phase, a matched group of low-risk youth will be recruited from the original screening cohort of our first study.  To achieve Objective 2, experience sampling method (ESM) with eight youth, their parents and teachers will be used to develop themes and questions for 10 focus groups (FG), four for parents, four for youths, and two for teachers.  Cohort participants will be sampled for ESM and FG based on criterion sampling (ADHD treatment status, gender, and race).  Feedback forums after each data collection phase will enhance validity and trustworthiness of findings.  A framework of critical theory will guide open coding, domain analysis, critical incident method and political analysis, which represent the qualitative data analysis methods used in this study.  In addition, the focus will be on perceived beneficial steps that could be taken to improve the help-seeking experience from the perspectives of the youth, parents, and teachers, culminating in a summary of suggested intervention options to improve equitable access to treatment.  For Objective 3, these intervention options, along with a summary of professional treatment guidelines for ADHD, will be presented to the entire study cohort, school district teachers, and medical treatment providers in the form of a survey for assessment of acceptability, feasibility, and perceived benefits.  Survey findings will be processed in feedback forums in preparation of pilot interventions.  The study occurs in partnership with the school district and an advisory board of school professionals, parents, and youth.  The research team has an extensive track record of success with similar study designs and will use innovative technologies to adhere to an efficient management plan.

"Enacted Stigma, Gender & Risk Behaviors of School Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and questioning (GLBQ) youth are at increased risk for health disparities, including HIV and teen pregnancy, vs. heterosexual peers, a risk attributed to the effects of nearly universal stigma for sexual minorities. Behaviors in a social group that convey or enforce stigma are enacted stigma; culture influences stigma, yet gender and ethnic variations in enacted stigma have seldom been examined among youth. Enacted stigma in school has been measured only indirectly in large-scale school-based surveys. To develop effective interventions, we need to understand enacted stigma among different cultural groups, develop culturally competent, reliable measures, and test the links between stigma and health behaviors in population-based surveys. Although GLBQ stigma is our primary focus, understanding how other types of stigma are enacted is important in developing general measures of enacted stigma. Therefore, the purpose of this 5-year, mixed-methods international study is to explore enacted stigma behaviors among indigenous, Asian-ancestry, and European-ancestry adolescents in school environments in Canada, New Zealand, and the U.S., to develop cross-cultural measures of enacted stigma for adolescent health surveys, and to examine the association of types of stigma and HIV risk behaviors among adolescents. The specific aims are:      I. To compare the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors associated with sexual orientation and other stigmatized identities among youth in existing large-scale school-based surveys, and to identify both the existing indirect measures of stigma that are risk factors plus the protective factors significantly associated with the HIV risk behaviors.      II. To identify the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors and associated risk and protective factors among indigenous adolescents--American Indian (U.S.), First Nations (Canada), Maori (New Zealand--as well as youth of Asian ancestry in each country, and to compare the patterns among adolescents of similar ethnic backgrounds in the 3 countries.      III. To explore among adolescent and adult key informants the ways stigma is understood, assigned, and enforced in the school environment, and to compare the patterns within the three countries. This exploration will be focused primarily on stigma based on sexual orientation status, but other types of stigmatized identities will be examined to understand the similarities and differences of how stigma is enacted, and the potential utility of generic stigma measures.      IV. Within each country, to elicit explanatory models from adolescents and youth workers on the survey findings of HIV risk behaviors and stigma, and to tap suggested strategies for reducing stigma and addressing sexual risk behaviors in culturally appropriate ways among GLBQ youth.      V. Incorporating the findings of aims I-IV, to develop, pilot, and psychometrically evaluate universal and country-specific culturally competent items and scales, for population-based adolescent health surveys, that measure perceived and enacted stigma in school, to allow cross-cultural comparisons of the effects of stigma among adolescents.

"Behavioral clustering in adolescents with STDs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Though the risk for STDs among adolescents is well described, knowledge of their sexual, drug-using and social networks is less well developed. In addition, the role of behavioral and psychosocial factors in transmission of STDs and blood borne infections (BBIs) has been considered primarily on the individual level, and rarely as group phenomena. In this study, we will explore whether the networks of young persons demonstrate assortative mixing with regard to behaviors and psychosocial characteristics as a function of infection with STDs and BBIs.

We propose enrolling 20 boys and 20 girls, age 15 years (10 each infected and uninfected), interviewing and testing them for STDs/BBIs six times over a 3 year period, and, at every other interview, eliciting contacts according to a fixed chain link design (total N=440 at every other interview). The resulting clusters and groupings will provide the basis for testing hypotheses that relate to the specific aims, primary among which are that network structure will exert an independent influence on the probability of infection, and that ""infected clusters"" (i.e. those in which the index respondent is infected) will demonstrate a greater degree of assortative mixing with regard to behavioral and psychosocial variables than uninfected clusters.  For this purpose, we will take advantage of the fact that the intraclass correlation coefficient and the design effect derived from it measure intracluster homogeneity and are thus a direct measure of assortative mixing within clusters. Demonstration of such phenomena will be of use in designing interventions that incorporate network information into their formulation.           ",Behavioral clustering in adolescents with STDs,6940793,R01HD043678,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' sexually transmitted disease ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' sex behavior ', ' social behavior ', ' psychometrics ', ' gender difference ', ' African American ', ' social support network ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' substance abuse related behavior ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,508601,0.09845550870973445
"Adolescent Preventive Services: Disparities and Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale and Objectives: Significant racial/ethnic disparities in health care utilization exist among adolescents. When adolescents do access the system, the preventive services delivery is below the recommended levels. However, little is known about racial/ethnic disparities in preventive services delivery. Minority adolescents have higher rates of risky health behaviors and associated outcomes in several key areas that are preventable. The long-term research objective is to decrease racial/ethnic disparities in adolescent health behaviors and outcomes. Specific aims are to determine if: 1) There are racial/ethnic disparities in the delivery of adolescent preventive services; 2) An intervention to increase the delivery of preventive services in primary care reduces racial/ethnic disparities in the receipt of preventive services; 3) Receipt of preventive services has a similar effect on adolescents of different racial/ethnic backgrounds. Research Design: Population: 2 samples will be utilized: 1) UCSF Sample: 3369 adolescents participated in an evaluation of adolescent preventive services in a large managed care organization; and 2) CHIS sample: 2898 California adolescents participated in The California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) in 2001. Measures: UCSF adolescent participants completed surveys immediately following clinical well care visits that queried whether providers screened and counseled them during the visit in 3 target areas: substance use, safety, and sexual behavior. A UCSF subsample also participated in a longitudinal study of health behaviors, completing health outcome and self-efficacy surveys prior to well visits and one year later at a 2nd annual well visit. CHIS participants completed phone surveys that included their attendance of well visits and whether their providers screened them in target areas. Methods: Secondary data analyses of these established data sets will be conducted to test for the presence of racial/ethnic disparities in adolescent preventive services and outcomes. We will conduct multiple regression and logistic regression analyses to examine the proposed aims. Outcomes for aims 1 and 2 are provider screening and counseling during well visits. Outcomes for aim 3 are behavior change and self- efficacy in the longitudinal subsample of adolescents who received preventive services. We will control for covariation from variables including adolescent characteristics, such as age and gender, and family characteristics, such as socio-economic status. Public Health Relevance: The identification of racial/ethnic disparities in preventive services delivery could increase awareness and prompt improvements in healthcare for all adolescents. The identification of disparities in health behavior and self-efficacy outcomes as the result of preventive services could lead to increased focus on meeting the needs of adolescents of differing racial/ethnic backgrounds.         ",Adolescent Preventive Services: Disparities and Outcomes,7037713,R03NR009397,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' managed care ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' health care service utilization ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' health behavior ', ' sex behavior ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' substance abuse related disorder ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' transportation /recreation safety ', ' ']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2005,75750,0.12877238806633884
"Anger Assessment and Intervention in Rural Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today's adolescents are living in violent times. The impending war with Iraq, the events of September 11, 2001, and the nations high terror alert prey upon adolescents' coping. The three leading causes of death among adolescents: injuries, homicide, and suicide, all have one thing in common, anger. Unattended anger often leads to violence, a pervasive problem among our nation's teens. An escalation in violence such as that seen in the tragedies at Columbine, Jonesboro, and other rural communities has made instituting coping strategies among this population essential. This project, Teaching Kids to Cope with Anger (TKC-A) is a school based behavioral intervention that addresses anger as a potential signal that may lead to problem behaviors in youth, especially those who live in rural areas for whom access to support is limited. One in six rural families live in poverty; high unemployment, bioterrorism, and other economic pressures put stress on teens, leading to increased risk for anxiety, depression, alcohol and substance use, delinquency, school failure, poor relations with peers, and loss of self esteem. It is no surprise; therefore, that youth who reside in rural areas are susceptible to anger management difficulties, which are compounded by a lack of access to mental health services that are typical of their communities. The goal of this study is to provide an intervention targeting anger as a factor that contributes to high-risk behavior for youth living in rural areas. TKC-A consists of eight one-hour interactive sessions that are led by a trained group leader. Coping skills are taught and practiced through role-playing, group projects, discussions, brainstorming, and handouts. The TKC-A targets freshman, sophomore, and junior level students who attend rural high schools in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Specific aims are to (1) describe anger experience, anger expression and its potential correlates (depressive symptoms, coping strategies, perceived social support, drug use, self-esteem, optimism, anxiety, life events, disciplinary actions, and demographic characteristics; (2) examine the relationship between anger and its potential correlates; and (3) evaluate the effect of the intervention. The intervention reduces a health disparity by providing a service for rural youth.

"Parent Intervention in CBT for Depressed Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite progress in treating mental disorders in youth, little is known about these interventions with Latinos who are now the largest minority group in the United States. This study examines the impact of enhancing effective interventions through the involvement of parents in an 8 session of a psycho education intervention (PPI). This PPI will be incorporated into the 12-session CBT, a Cognitive Behavioral treatment method that has already been shown effective for the treatment of adolescent depression. This study will randomize 140 Latino adolescents with Major Depression to CBT with or without a PPI delivered in groups. Intake diagnoses will be obtained via structured diagnostic interviews (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-DISC for adolescents and Composite International Diagnostic Interview-CIDI for parents). The study will focus on Puerto Rican adolescents and their parents. The primary aims address both the efficacy and effectiveness of the intervention and treatments. Efficacy questions focus on the comparison of the active treatment with and without the PPI for reducing depressive symptoms and diagnosis (DISC) after 12 weeks of treatment and for preventing relapse over the course of one year post-treatment (DISC). Effectiveness questions focus on the impact of the treatment with or without the PPI on broader functional outcomes. Patient functional outcomes include general functioning status, family functioning, school attendance, and attrition rates. The relative value of CBT with and without the adjunctive parent intervention for improved parent functioning regarding psychiatric distress and symptoms, burden of patient illness, and work attendance will be examined. We hypothesize that the active treatment with PPI will be superior to no PPI in reducing depression at post treatment. Because the PPI is designed to involve parents and thus impact other aspects of the family system, this treatment is expected to produce better outcomes in several of the functional domains. To test the theoretical assumptions of the intervention, we also aim to examine the contribution of hypothesized treatment-specific change mechanisms to mediate the short-term outcome and predict long-term relapse over one year. This study responds to NIH and NIMH initiatives on decreasing disparities in health and mental health care between minorities and White populations and will contribute to our knowledge base.         ",Parent Intervention in CBT for Depressed Latino Youth,6900991,R01MH067893,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' clinical trial ', ' relapse /recurrence ', ' family structure /dynamics ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' mental disorder prevention ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' mental disorder diagnosis ', ' major depression ', ' Hispanic American ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' functional ability ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' patient oriented research ', ' mental health education ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO RIO PIEDRAS,R01,2005,398308,0.01208948216580988
"Trauma, Loss, and Grief in African American Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is ample evidence that many African American teens are exposed to considerable violence as victims, witnesses and close others of victims. Health disparities literature suggests that black youth also will experience the loss of close others through non-violent means and are themselves at risk for illness and accident. However, the role of these types of events, particularly the loss of close others from violence and non-violence, has not been adequately investigated as a factor in behavior problems or mental health difficulties for these high risk youth. The specific aims of the study are to examine: 1) the occurrence of loss and trauma involving close others in a sample of urban adolescents; 2) the extent to which trauma involving close others, and grief, are related to mental health outcomes (PTSD, anxiety, depression) and problem behaviors (internalizing and externalizing) relative to other sources of trauma (witnessing of violence, victimization, and non-violent trauma), and; 3) gender differences in the pattern of trauma exposure and its impact. The current study will screen a sample of 260 black adolescents, in grades 6-8, at a local elementary school located in a moderately high violence, but typical, neighborhood on the south side of Chicago. Students will complete a series of standard outcome measures and a packet of instruments that have been used with similar populations to screen for trauma, loss, grief, and PTSD symptoms. The immediate goal of the study is to understand how loss and trauma associated with death and injury of close others contribute to negative outcomes for these at-risk youth. The findings will help to identify those factors that influence the well-being of black youth, and provide a clearer framework for intervention. This work is seen as a preliminary study of relationships that should be examined in a more representative sample of black youth and their caregivers using multiple methods and sources of data.         ","Trauma, Loss, and Grief in African American Adolescents",6925059,R03MH071423,"['child behavior ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' human subject ', ' questionnaire ', ' psychological shock ', ' anxiety ', ' depression ', ' grief ', ' early experience ', ' gender difference ', ' African American ', ' posttraumatic stress disorder ', ' violence ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' patient oriented research ', ' ']",NIMH,CHICAGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2005,74500,0.013679586768356192
"Sexual Orientation and Health Disparities in Adolescence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healthy People 2010, the nation's essential document for setting the national agenda for health, identifies the persistence of health disparities across communities to be among the leading health challenges of our era. Recent studies suggest that the health of the nation's adolescent population may be patterned in important ways by sexual orientation group disparities. Depressive symptoms and low self-esteem have been proposed as underlying vulnerabilities driving elevated rates of risk behaviors in sexual minority adolescents. Rosario et al. propose a psychosocial Coming Out Process (COP) Model for adolescents in which dimensions of the process are linked with health behaviors. Additionally, drawing on Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), we propose that social norms in lesbian/bisexual female (LB) and gay/bisexual male (GB) communities also influence both positively and negatively health behaviors of sexual minority youth through processes of social learning. Family environment, an adolescent's age at the time of coming out, and presence or absence of preexisting psychosocial distress may be important factors influencing a young person's resiliency or risk and their experience with the coming out process. Research is needed to explore important predictors of the process of coming out and how this process relates to health behavior.       We will examine sexual orientation in association with weight concerns, disordered weight control behaviors, binge eating, and tobacco and alcohol use in adolescent girls and boys in the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), a longitudinal cohort study of 16,882 adolescents living across the U.S. In addition, we will examine factors that underlie the coming out process in adolescence, leading some to be more resilient while others have greater difficulties. Our specific aims are to compare the prevalence and severity over 4 years of follow-up of weight concerns and tobacco and alcohol use across sexual orientation groups among adolescent girls and boys and to empirically test the application of the COP Model and SCT to understand sexual orientation group disparities in health. We will examine prospectively the contribution of components of the COP Model and SCT in their relation to psychological distress and factors linked with LB and GB community social norms and orientation group differences in health outcomes.

"HIV PREVENTION FOR ADOLESCENTS: RESEARCH TO PRACTICE   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                                          This proposed study targeting drug abusing adolescents is a 5-year randomized        controlled trial of an Enhanced-Cognitive Behavioral HIV prevention                  intervention, augmented by components focused on Social Influence                    (Soc-Influence) and Psychiatric/Psychological (Psych) Symptoms. The primary aim      is to compare the effects of E-CB on primary outcomes (HIV risk behaviors) with      a Health Promotion Comparison (HPC) condition, matched for attention, time, and      attention value, when administered under conditions approaching ecologically         valid ""real life"" community circumstances. E-CB is considered an enhancement         over existing CB approaches because it integrates key components derived from        ""effective"" CB adolescent-specific HIV interventions, as appraised in the CDC's      Compendium of HIV Prevention Interventions, and adds components to address           Soc-Influence (parental monitoring and parent-child communication) and Psych         factors (drug abuse & psychiatric symptom severity). The proposed sample of 160      male and 160 female adolescents will be drawn from a target population of            predominantly minority, low income, culturally diverse, sexually active,             alcohol and other drug (AOD) abusing youth-a group most disproportionately           affected by HIV and other health disparities. We propose to examine how              intervention effects are 1) mediated by Attitude-Motivation-Skill variables,         Social Influence, and Psychiatric Variables and moderated by 4 key factors:          age, gender, cognitive functioning, and traumatic abuse history. HLM and SEM         procedures will be used to explore how study variables interrelate to predict        outcome. This project is significant in its response to the NIH priority on          translational research, in which HIV prevention is refocused on the adaptation       of ""effective"" interventions to reach new populations. The proposed project          further responds to the NIH priority on bridging clinical research and               practice, the emphasis is to bring interventions developed during efficacy           trials in a rigorous academic setting, into communities in a manner adaptable        to ""real world"" conditions by community based providers. If successful, this         research will delineate important HIV risk factors and new intervention              strategies that can be practically implemented with high-risk adolescents            within their communities.

"Challenges of adjustment to HIV infection in adolescents  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Adolescents constitute one of the fastest growing populations of HIV-infected individuals today.  For a variety of reasons, adolescents living with HIV/AIDS constitute a population at risk for psychosocial adjustment to their illness.  First, like all adolescents with chronic diseases, they confront a variety of non-normative stresses that can increase their risk for psychological and social problems, as well as alter their development trajectories.  In addition, many of these adolescents, especially those who acquired infection through sexual practices and drug related activities, have histories of physical and sexual abuse, parental neglect, parental alcohol and substance abuse, and other significant stressors which are recognized risk factors for poor psychosocial morbidity.  Over the last decade, advances in the treatment of HIV disease have significantly extended survival, allowing most infected individuals who learn of their infection and enter treatment to now live with HIV/AIDS as a chronic disease.  Building on our previous work and given the scarcity of information about the lived experiences of HIV-infected adolescents we propose a qualitative study of 80 HIV-infected African-American and Latino youth, age 13-24 years, residing in New York City (40 males, 40 females) to assess the adaptive challenges, coping responses, the specific role of substance use in adaptive efforts and risky behavior; and how HIV infection in adolescents may interfere with the accomplishment of age-specific developmental tasks.

"Bronx Youth as Partners Community Participatory Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This 3-year project uses community-based participatory action research to address health disparities among African American and Latino youth in the Bronx, NY, who are the defined ""community"" for this project.  We will design, implement and conduct a process evaluation of an intervention to reduce one health disparity selected by this community.  Adolescents are the lead decision-makers; there are two levels of partnership: The Project Planning Group (PPG) and The Bronx Coalition for Adolescent Health (Coalition) Both will be full participants in each phase of the work. The PPG includes: 14 Bronx teenagers age 14-19 that represent the larger community of Bronx teens; 2 researchers with scientific expertise; 2 program specialists with expertise on developing/implementing interventions; and 3 physicians who will provide health information.  The Coalition includes organizations having broad experience serving youth or specific expertise in a health disparity and will provide advice, and political and practical support. Specific Aim 1, building a partnership, will be accomplished through recommended strategies (e.g., having someone responsible for nurturing the partnership itself, shared responsibility for developing rules and processes, equity in decision making).  Specific Aim 2, conducting a needs assessment, includes analyses of national and local data; in-depth community interviews with stakeholders; a ""Windshield Tour"" to identify community factors; and data on relevant Bronx programs.  Specific Aim 3, selecting a health disparity, will be guided by Friere's structured dialogue model of listening-dialogue-action. Consensus methods will be used to select one disparity.  Friere's action phase will be implemented in Specific Aim 4, developing the intervention. We will develop the program using techniques used in our adolescent intervention trials.

"Adolescent Obesity: Academic-Community Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal is designed to obtain the perspectives of 50 adolescents as well as 100 parents and community members about barriers to and effective community-based interventions for managing adolescent obesity. Obesity is the second leading cause of preventable disease in the United States and as such is a public health priority. Twenty-five percent of all adolescents are overweight or obese and of those seventy percent will become obese adults who are at risk for diabetes, hypertension, and cardiac disease. This proposal relies on the combined resources of Saint Paul's Missionary Baptist Church (serving a low income African American population), Ponderosa High School (a rural school serving a large number of Hispanic/Latino teens), California State University, Sacramento (CSUS, an EARDA school), and the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of California Davis (UCD, a research intensive school). Six focus groups aimed at identifying the causes of and solutions to adolescent obesity will be conducted. Phenomenology will be used to analyze the results of the focus groups and workshops will be designed based on those results. Nine workshops will be offered by CSUS' and UCD faculty members to promote healthy adolescent lifestyle choices and minimize obesity. A nationally known NIH funded researcher will also present a workshop on preventing and treating adolescent obesity. Subsequent focus groups will be held to evaluate the perspectives of teens, parents, and community leaders about the effectiveness of these 10 workshops as an intervention to minimize adolescent obesity. Planning groups will also be held to design a translational intervention grant targeting adolescent obesity. In summary, specific aims of the proposal include: 1) identifying and documenting adolescents', parents', and community leaders' views regarding the attitudes, beliefs, health behaviors, and lifestyle habits that influence adolescent eating and exercise habits, and 2) developing a translational intervention grant designed to minimize adolescent obesity at Saint Paul's Missionary Baptist Church and Ponderosa High School.

"ALDINE - UT PARTNERSHIP TO PREVENT OBESITY IN YOUTH    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents has increased and the greatest increases have been among ethnic/racial minority groups. This two-year developmental study will be conducted through a partnership between the University of Texas-Houston and the Aldine Independent School District (AISD). In this large school district in the Houston metropolitan area, large proportions of students are at high risk for obesity; 55% of the students are Hispanic, 34% are African American, and 72% of students are economically disadvantaged. The efficacy of school-based interventions to improve health behavior, reduce fat and sodium in school meal programs, and increase the dose and frequency of moderate to vigorous physical activity has been tested in previous studies but few have had an impact on body mass or percent body fat. Further, there is little evidence to support interventions for ethnic minority children and those economically disadvantaged. This project will build on previous studies, but will be innovative, and perhaps more sustainable, by engaging the community in a partnership approach. The aims of this developmental phase are to assess the prevalence of obesity and associated risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes in the target population of school age children (Kindergarten through 6th grade); assess the school environments of these children in relation to food options and opportunities for physical activity; and engage school personnel, students and their parents in a participatory process to assess, analyze and plan new approaches to prevent and reduce obesity in youth. The long-range goal is to work with the community to plan actions that are culturally congruent, could be tested for effectiveness, and are sustainable. The ultimate goal is reduce health disparities attributable to obesity-related conditions.

"Understanding Social Status' Impact on Adolescent Health   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elimination of social inequalities in                                         health is one of the overarching goals of Healthy People 2010. Most past work        has defined social status as socioeconomic status (SES), an external measure         that does not account for subjective, internalized perceptions of social             standing. Most studies also do not explain how lower social status causes            poorer health. Using a new measure of subjective social standing developed by        members of the investigative team, this study tests a novel explanatory model        of social status' impact on health. The model identifies the HPA axis and            autonomic nervous system as critical biologic systems in the creation of social      inequalities in health. Social status, an environmental stress, causes               stimulation of these systems which, in turn, leads to alterations in                 neurohormonal mediators of the social status-health relationship. The study          dovetails to a new 4-year longitudinal cohort study of adolescent obesity and        Type 2 diabetes in a racially and socioeconomically diverse school district in       Ohio. Both of these diseases support this model. The specific aims are 1 )To         describe adolescents' perceptions of social standing and the developmental           changes which occur in these perceptions over a four year period; 2) To              characterize the associations between social status, measured both objectively       and subjectively, and obesity and insulin resistance among adolescents; and 3)       To determine the relationships between social status, measured both objectively      and subjectively, and potential biologic mediators of social status' impact on       health. To address these aims, yearly assessment of adolescents' subjective          social standing will take place. In addition, in Years 1 and 4, potential            primary and secondary biologic mediators (insulin, DHEA-S, blood pressure,           total and HDL cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin) will be obtained.            Parents will provide information on SES and their own perceptions of social          standing in Years 1 and 4. This study will provide unique, community-based           information on potential biologic mediators of social status' influence on           health. The population's diversity will enable us to differentiate the effects       of race/ethnicity and social status.

"A Multilevel HIV-Prevention Strategy for High-Risk Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This multisite project provides a unique test of a multilevel HIV/STD prevention strategy for high-risk youth.  A total of 1600 African American adolescents, ages 12-16, will be recruited through CBOs in 4 cities, two in the Northeast (Providence and Syracuse) and two in the Southeast (Columbia and Macon), to participate in this HIV/STD prevention trial.  Adolescents will complete a baseline ACASI administered survey to assess their attitudes, beliefs and sexual behaviors, and provide a urine specimen for detection of three prevalent STDs.  Following baseline assessment, all adolescents will be randomly assigned to receive either the Focus on Kids HIV-prevention intervention or a General Health Promotion control. Subsequently, adolescents will be followed longitudinally and complete similar assessments at 6-, 12- and 18-months follow-up.  The second level of intervention involves tailored HIV/STD prevention messages through local mass media.  One city in each regional city-pair will be randomly assigned to receive the HIV prevention media campaign while the other city will serve as a control city (no media campaign).  Thus, the media messages will be directed to African American youth in only one of the two cities in each geographic region. The media program will deliver HIV-prevention messages that are culturally sensitive and age appropriate; these programs will promote both abstinence and risk reduction practices.  Cross-sectional surveys of 1200 African American youth using random-digit-dialing telephone interviews in the two cities that receive the media campaign and the two media control cities will be conducted over a 30-month period to determine the community-wide effects of the HIV media campaign.  This design will enable a test of the joint and separate effects of the two interventions over an 18-month follow-up for the youth participating in the small-group interventions.  In addition, the media campaign is predicted to independently enhance adolescents' adoption of HIV-preventive attitudes, beliefs and behaviors on a community-wide basis compared to youth in the non-media control cities.  Causal modeling methodology will be employed to assess the effects of the two levels of intervention and to identify the role of supportive messages received through the media and from peers that are predicted to maintain safer sexual behavior as adolescents mature.         ",A Multilevel HIV-Prevention Strategy for High-Risk Youth,6954235,U01MH066785,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' sexually transmitted disease ', ' cooperative study ', ' AIDS education /prevention ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' human subject ', ' information dissemination ', ' mass information media ', ' interview ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' sex behavior ', ' small social group ', ' African American ', ' community ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' safe sex /sex abstinence ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,U01,2005,612403,0.07988026471049575
"Anger Assessment and Intervention in Rural Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today's adolescents are living in violent times. The impending war with Iraq, the events of September 11, 2001, and the nations high terror alert prey upon adolescents' coping. The three leading causes of death among adolescents: injuries, homicide, and suicide, all have one thing in common, anger. Unattended anger often leads to violence, a pervasive problem among our nation's teens. An escalation in violence such as that seen in the tragedies at Columbine, Jonesboro, and other rural communities has made instituting coping strategies among this population essential. This project, Teaching Kids to Cope with Anger (TKC-A) is a school based behavioral intervention that addresses anger as a potential signal that may lead to problem behaviors in youth, especially those who live in rural areas for whom access to support is limited. One in six rural families live in poverty; high unemployment, bioterrorism, and other economic pressures put stress on teens, leading to increased risk for anxiety, depression, alcohol and substance use, delinquency, school failure, poor relations with peers, and loss of self esteem. It is no surprise; therefore, that youth who reside in rural areas are susceptible to anger management difficulties, which are compounded by a lack of access to mental health services that are typical of their communities. The goal of this study is to provide an intervention targeting anger as a factor that contributes to high-risk behavior for youth living in rural areas. TKC-A consists of eight one-hour interactive sessions that are led by a trained group leader. Coping skills are taught and practiced through role-playing, group projects, discussions, brainstorming, and handouts. The TKC-A targets freshman, sophomore, and junior level students who attend rural high schools in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Specific aims are to (1) describe anger experience, anger expression and its potential correlates (depressive symptoms, coping strategies, perceived social support, drug use, self-esteem, optimism, anxiety, life events, disciplinary actions, and demographic characteristics; (2) examine the relationship between anger and its potential correlates; and (3) evaluate the effect of the intervention. The intervention reduces a health disparity by providing a service for rural youth.

"ALDINE - UT PARTNERSHIP TO PREVENT OBESITY IN YOUTH    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents has increased and the greatest increases have been among ethnic/racial minority groups. This two-year developmental study will be conducted through a partnership between the University of Texas-Houston and the Aldine Independent School District (AISD). In this large school district in the Houston metropolitan area, large proportions of students are at high risk for obesity; 55% of the students are Hispanic, 34% are African American, and 72% of students are economically disadvantaged. The efficacy of school-based interventions to improve health behavior, reduce fat and sodium in school meal programs, and increase the dose and frequency of moderate to vigorous physical activity has been tested in previous studies but few have had an impact on body mass or percent body fat. Further, there is little evidence to support interventions for ethnic minority children and those economically disadvantaged. This project will build on previous studies, but will be innovative, and perhaps more sustainable, by engaging the community in a partnership approach. The aims of this developmental phase are to assess the prevalence of obesity and associated risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes in the target population of school age children (Kindergarten through 6th grade); assess the school environments of these children in relation to food options and opportunities for physical activity; and engage school personnel, students and their parents in a participatory process to assess, analyze and plan new approaches to prevent and reduce obesity in youth. The long-range goal is to work with the community to plan actions that are culturally congruent, could be tested for effectiveness, and are sustainable. The ultimate goal is reduce health disparities attributable to obesity-related conditions.

"HIV PREVENTION FOR ADOLESCENTS: RESEARCH TO PRACTICE   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                                          This proposed study targeting drug abusing adolescents is a 5-year randomized        controlled trial of an Enhanced-Cognitive Behavioral HIV prevention                  intervention, augmented by components focused on Social Influence                    (Soc-Influence) and Psychiatric/Psychological (Psych) Symptoms. The primary aim      is to compare the effects of E-CB on primary outcomes (HIV risk behaviors) with      a Health Promotion Comparison (HPC) condition, matched for attention, time, and      attention value, when administered under conditions approaching ecologically         valid ""real life"" community circumstances. E-CB is considered an enhancement         over existing CB approaches because it integrates key components derived from        ""effective"" CB adolescent-specific HIV interventions, as appraised in the CDC's      Compendium of HIV Prevention Interventions, and adds components to address           Soc-Influence (parental monitoring and parent-child communication) and Psych         factors (drug abuse & psychiatric symptom severity). The proposed sample of 160      male and 160 female adolescents will be drawn from a target population of            predominantly minority, low income, culturally diverse, sexually active,             alcohol and other drug (AOD) abusing youth-a group most disproportionately           affected by HIV and other health disparities. We propose to examine how              intervention effects are 1) mediated by Attitude-Motivation-Skill variables,         Social Influence, and Psychiatric Variables and moderated by 4 key factors:          age, gender, cognitive functioning, and traumatic abuse history. HLM and SEM         procedures will be used to explore how study variables interrelate to predict        outcome. This project is significant in its response to the NIH priority on          translational research, in which HIV prevention is refocused on the adaptation       of ""effective"" interventions to reach new populations. The proposed project          further responds to the NIH priority on bridging clinical research and               practice, the emphasis is to bring interventions developed during efficacy           trials in a rigorous academic setting, into communities in a manner adaptable        to ""real world"" conditions by community based providers.

"Understanding Social Status' Impact on Adolescent Health   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elimination of social inequalities in                                         health is one of the overarching goals of Healthy People 2010. Most past work        has defined social status as socioeconomic status (SES), an external measure         that does not account for subjective, internalized perceptions of social             standing. Most studies also do not explain how lower social status causes            poorer health. Using a new measure of subjective social standing developed by        members of the investigative team, this study tests a novel explanatory model        of social status' impact on health. The model identifies the HPA axis and            autonomic nervous system as critical biologic systems in the creation of social      inequalities in health. Social status, an environmental stress, causes               stimulation of these systems which, in turn, leads to alterations in                 neurohormonal mediators of the social status-health relationship. The study          dovetails to a new 4-year longitudinal cohort study of adolescent obesity and        Type 2 diabetes in a racially and socioeconomically diverse school district in       Ohio. Both of these diseases support this model. The specific aims are 1 )To         describe adolescents' perceptions of social standing and the developmental           changes which occur in these perceptions over a four year period; 2) To              characterize the associations between social status, measured both objectively       and subjectively, and obesity and insulin resistance among adolescents; and 3)       To determine the relationships between social status, measured both objectively      and subjectively, and potential biologic mediators of social status' impact on       health. To address these aims, yearly assessment of adolescents' subjective          social standing will take place. In addition, in Years 1 and 4, potential            primary and secondary biologic mediators (insulin, DHEA-S, blood pressure,           total and HDL cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin) will be obtained.            Parents will provide information on SES and their own perceptions of social          standing in Years 1 and 4. This study will provide unique, community-based           information on potential biologic mediators of social status' influence on           health. The population's diversity will enable us to differentiate the effects       of race/ethnicity and social status. The innovative measurement of social            status, which includes both subjective and objective components, may explain         some of the inconsistency in the SES-obesity relationship and the secular            trends in obesity and diabetes. This work will also lay the foundation for           creation of effective primary prevention strategies by providing insight into        the processes through which social inequalities in health are created.

"Trauma, Loss, and Grief in African American Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is ample evidence that many African American teens are exposed to considerable violence as victims, witnesses and close others of victims. Health disparities literature suggests that black youth also will experience the loss of close others through non-violent means and are themselves at risk for illness and accident. However, the role of these types of events, particularly the loss of close others from violence and non-violence, has not been adequately investigated as a factor in behavior problems or mental health difficulties for these high risk youth. The specific aims of the study are to examine: 1) the occurrence of loss and trauma involving close others in a sample of urban adolescents; 2) the extent to which trauma involving close others, and grief, are related to mental health outcomes (PTSD, anxiety, depression) and problem behaviors (internalizing and externalizing) relative to other sources of trauma (witnessing of violence, victimization, and non-violent trauma), and; 3) gender differences in the pattern of trauma exposure and its impact. The current study will screen a sample of 260 black adolescents, in grades 6-8, at a local elementary school located in a moderately high violence, but typical, neighborhood on the south side of Chicago. Students will complete a series of standard outcome measures and a packet of instruments that have been used with similar populations to screen for trauma, loss, grief, and PTSD symptoms. The immediate goal of the study is to understand how loss and trauma associated with death and injury of close others contribute to negative outcomes for these at-risk youth. The findings will help to identify those factors that influence the well-being of black youth, and provide a clearer framework for intervention. This work is seen as a preliminary study of relationships that should be examined in a more representative sample of black youth and their caregivers using multiple methods and sources of data.         ","Trauma, Loss, and Grief in African American Adolescents",7030236,R03MH071423,"['child behavior ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' human subject ', ' questionnaire ', ' psychological shock ', ' anxiety ', ' depression ', ' grief ', ' early experience ', ' gender difference ', ' African American ', ' posttraumatic stress disorder ', ' violence ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' patient oriented research ', ' ']",NIMH,CHICAGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2006,72749,0.013679586768356192
"Maintaining HIV Prevention Gains in Female Adolescents DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is the only age category where the number of females becoming infected with HIV outnumber the number of males.  Despite these data, only four randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of a gender-specific HIV-risk reduction program for adolescent females.  The proposed research aims to address this gap in HIV prevention science, and will evaluate the short and longer-term efficacy of an HIV prevention intervention for adolescent girls.  We will recruit 640 adolescent females aged 15 to 19 years from family planning clinics and randomly assign them to one of two conditions: (a) an HIV-risk reduction intervention based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model (Fisher & Fisher, 1992); or, (b) a structurally equivalent health promotion control group (CTL), both supplemented by booster sessions at three and six months.  At a short-term (three-month) follow up, we hypothesize that IMB participants will increase HIV related knowledge, motivation, and behavioral skills, and decrease the frequency of risky sexual practices relative to CTL participants.  We will reassess all participants at six and 12 months to evaluate the longer-term efficacy of the interventions.  At these longer-term follow-ups, we hypothesize that IMB participants will demonstrate higher levels of HIV knowledge, motivation, and behavioral skills; decreased risky sexual practices; and decreased rates of STDs (chlamydia, gonorrhea) relative to the CTL participants.  The final aim of the proposed research is to determine whether the constructs in the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) Model (Fisher & Fisher, 1992), can account for variability in HIV-related behavior.  We hypothesize that preventive behavior at six and 12 months will be a function of a participant's HIV-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills at the three-month follow up, and that information and motivation will be partially mediated by behavioral skills to influence the initiation and maintenance of HIV preventive behavior.  The long-term intent of the proposed research is to develop a risk reduction program that can be used by community-based health organizations to reduce the risk of HIV infection among adolescent females.

"A Community-Academic Partnership to Address Disparities*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  As outlined in Healthy People 2010, eliminating health disparities, especially with respect to child obesity, is a major U.S. goal.  Obesity rates among youth have been rising dramatically in recent years, with a concomitant rise in the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  In Los Angles County, the site of our proposed study, the prevalence of obesity among African-American and Latino teenagers is about 50% higher than for White teenagers; available data for Asian/Pacific Islander youth also suggest disparities.  Limited physical activity and poor diet contribute to obesity and are prevalent among youth from all racial/ethnic groups, but especially among African Americans and Latinos.  We propose a three-year community-based participatory research project to develop and pilot test an intervention that addresses racial/ethnic disparities in obesity among adolescents in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).  We aim to (1) build a strong community-academic partnership and assess community needs and priorities for obesity-related programs among adolescents through effective collaboration among LAUSD staff, researchers, and key community stakeholders; (2.) jointly design a pilot intervention to reduce/prevent obesity among adolescents of diverse race/ethnicity through such potential strategies as increasing physical activity and/or healthy eating behaviors; and (3) pilot test the feasibility and effects of the intervention among adolescents of diverse race/ethnicity.  To accomplish these aims, we will build upon an existing collaboration among LAUSD, the UCLA/RAND Center for Adolescent Health Promotion, and stakeholders in an ethnically and racially-diverse community-the Carson-Wilmington area of LA. LAUSD and community stakeholders have identified addressing adolescent obesity as a high priority. We will conduct extensive formative work, including qualitative interviews, focus groups, site visits, and surveys with community stakeholders, to assess priorities and potential strategies for addressing adolescent obesity; we will use this information to design and pilot test an intervention uniquely tailored to the community.  We anticipate revising the intervention based on pilot results and seeking additional funds to conduct a full evaluation throughout LAUSD.  We also anticipate that the community-academic partnership and infrastructure developed during this process will allow us to continue to collaborate in addressing health disparities facing the youth of LA.         ",A Community-Academic Partnership to Address Disparities*,7126408,R24MD001648,[''],NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R24,2006,702086,0.11967475554002055
"Parent Intervention in CBT for Depressed Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite progress in treating mental disorders in youth, little is known about these interventions with Latinos who are now the largest minority group in the United States. This study examines the impact of enhancing effective interventions through the involvement of parents in an 8 session of a psycho education intervention (PPI). This PPI will be incorporated into the 12-session CBT, a Cognitive Behavioral treatment method that has already been shown effective for the treatment of adolescent depression. This study will randomize 140 Latino adolescents with Major Depression to CBT with or without a PPI delivered in groups. Intake diagnoses will be obtained via structured diagnostic interviews (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-DISC for adolescents and Composite International Diagnostic Interview-CIDI for parents). The study will focus on Puerto Rican adolescents and their parents. The primary aims address both the efficacy and effectiveness of the intervention and treatments. Efficacy questions focus on the comparison of the active treatment with and without the PPI for reducing depressive symptoms and diagnosis (DISC) after 12 weeks of treatment and for preventing relapse over the course of one year post-treatment (DISC). Effectiveness questions focus on the impact of the treatment with or without the PPI on broader functional outcomes. Patient functional outcomes include general functioning status, family functioning, school attendance, and attrition rates. The relative value of CBT with and without the adjunctive parent intervention for improved parent functioning regarding psychiatric distress and symptoms, burden of patient illness, and work attendance will be examined. We hypothesize that the active treatment with PPI will be superior to no PPI in reducing depression at post treatment. Because the PPI is designed to involve parents and thus impact other aspects of the family system, this treatment is expected to produce better outcomes in several of the functional domains. To test the theoretical assumptions of the intervention, we also aim to examine the contribution of hypothesized treatment-specific change mechanisms to mediate the short-term outcome and predict long-term relapse over one year. This study responds to NIH and NIMH initiatives on decreasing disparities in health and mental health care between minorities and White populations and will contribute to our knowledge base.         ",Parent Intervention in CBT for Depressed Latino Youth,7082126,R01MH067893,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' clinical trial ', ' relapse /recurrence ', ' family structure /dynamics ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' mental disorder prevention ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' mental disorder diagnosis ', ' major depression ', ' Hispanic American ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' functional ability ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' patient oriented research ', ' mental health education ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO RIO PIEDRAS,R01,2006,407979,0.01208948216580988
"Teen Males Reproductive Health Needs & Barriers to Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the U.S, teen males, especially older and minority adolescent males, engage in sexual risk behaviors that result in reproductive problems among adolescents of both genders, including sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy. Efforts to promote safe sexual behaviors have been shown to be effective to prevent such morbidity and should start ideally during adolescence. Practice guidelines recommend that clinicians promote reproductive health among all adolescents, such as screening and counseling about sex and its consequences. Current efforts however target primarily females. We know very little about how to effectively promote reproductive health for males or how males think about their reproductive health needs. This is especially relevant since boys' use of health care declines during adolescence, which can ultimately result in unmet health needs. The ultimate goal of this study is to better understand adolescent males' perceived reproductive health needs in context of their general needs and identify those factors that are amenable to change in order to inform the development of adolescent male reproductive health intervention programs.  The candidate is a pediatrician and specialist in adolescent medicine at the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) who has conducted preliminary research on adolescent males. The training phase of the award will include 5 activities:  1) to learn how to develop study measures for behavioral research, 2) to develop further skills in data collection, including semi-structured patient-oriented interviews, 3) to learn how to design and analyze longitudinal studies, 4) to develop skills in the responsible conduct of research, and 5) to refine skills in presenting, publishing and grant writing.  These objectives will be accomplished through mentored research activities, and complemented by focused coursework available through an existing UMB K30 award for training of clinical investigators. The research phase of the award includes a description of adolescent males' (ages 12-19) actual and perceived reproductive health needs, reproductive health care use, predictors of care use, and reproductive health morbidity by using an existing dataset and primary data collection. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health, Aim 1 of this study is to determine the extent to which adolescent males have reproductive health needs and the factors that predict reproductive health care use. Using primary data collection and analysis among adolescent males, parents and clinical experts, Aim 2 of this study is to explore adolescent males' perceived general and reproductive health needs and experiences with the health care system. Upon completion of this award, the candidate will become a rigorous behavioral scientist informed by his clinical orientation and enrich our understanding of domestic adolescent males' reproductive health and mechanisms by which to increase their access to clinical reproductive services.

"Bronx Youth as Partners in Community Participatory Rese*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This 3-year project uses community-based participatory action research to address health disparities among African American and Latino youth in the Bronx, NY, who are the defined ""community"" for this project.  We will design, implement and conduct a process evaluation of an intervention to reduce one health disparity selected by this community.  Adolescents are the lead decision-makers; there are two levels of partnership: The Project Planning Group (PPG) and The Bronx Coalition for Adolescent Health (Coalition) Both will be full participants in each phase of the work. The PPG includes: 14 Bronx teenagers age 14-19 that represent the larger community of Bronx teens; 2 researchers with scientific expertise; 2 program specialists with expertise on developing/implementing interventions; and 3 physicians who will provide health information.  The Coalition includes organizations having broad experience serving youth or specific expertise in a health disparity and will provide advice, and political and practical support. Specific Aim 1, building a partnership, will be accomplished through recommended strategies (e.g., having someone responsible for nurturing the partnership itself, shared responsibility for developing rules and processes, equity in decision making).  Specific Aim 2, conducting a needs assessment, includes analyses of national and local data; in-depth community interviews with stakeholders; a ""Windshield Tour"" to identify community factors; and data on relevant Bronx programs.  Specific Aim 3, selecting a health disparity, will be guided by Friere's structured dialogue model of listening-dialogue-action. Consensus methods will be used to select one disparity.  Friere's action phase will be implemented in Specific Aim 4, developing the intervention. We will develop the program using techniques used in our adolescent intervention trials. The PPG/Coalition will identify goals with the PPG staff will provide technical assistance. Specific Aim 5, piloting/conducting a process evaluation, will identify problems in recruitment, retention, receptivity, etc.  Specific Aim 6, evaluating the partnership, will assess the success of the partnership on leadership/management, the collaborative process, efficiency, synergy, empowerment, and satisfaction using the Partnership Self-Assessment Tool along with qualitative interviews.  This process will lead to a testable community-based intervention that has grown from the community's own experience and expertise, informed by epidemiologic data, program expertise and theory.         ",Bronx Youth as Partners in Community Participatory Rese*,7126763,R24MD001784,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' health education ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' health care service planning ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' health care model ', ' health survey ', ' health behavior ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' community ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R24,2006,503013,0.06450025080560957
"Understanding Social Status' Impact on Adolescent Health   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elimination of social inequalities in                                         health is one of the overarching goals of Healthy People 2010. Most past work        has defined social status as socioeconomic status (SES), an external measure         that does not account for subjective, internalized perceptions of social             standing. Most studies also do not explain how lower social status causes            poorer health. Using a new measure of subjective social standing developed by        members of the investigative team, this study tests a novel explanatory model        of social status' impact on health. The model identifies the HPA axis and            autonomic nervous system as critical biologic systems in the creation of social      inequalities in health. Social status, an environmental stress, causes               stimulation of these systems which, in turn, leads to alterations in                 neurohormonal mediators of the social status-health relationship. The study          dovetails to a new 4-year longitudinal cohort study of adolescent obesity and        Type 2 diabetes in a racially and socioeconomically diverse school district in       Ohio. Both of these diseases support this model. The specific aims are 1 )To         describe adolescents' perceptions of social standing and the developmental           changes which occur in these perceptions over a four year period; 2) To              characterize the associations between social status, measured both objectively       and subjectively, and obesity and insulin resistance among adolescents; and 3)       To determine the relationships between social status, measured both objectively      and subjectively, and potential biologic mediators of social status' impact on       health. To address these aims, yearly assessment of adolescents' subjective          social standing will take place. In addition, in Years 1 and 4, potential            primary and secondary biologic mediators (insulin, DHEA-S, blood pressure,           total and HDL cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin) will be obtained.            Parents will provide information on SES and their own perceptions of social          standing in Years 1 and 4. This study will provide unique, community-based           information on potential biologic mediators of social status' influence on           health. The population's diversity will enable us to differentiate the effects       of race/ethnicity and social status. The innovative measurement of social            status, which includes both subjective and objective components, may explain         some of the inconsistency in the SES-obesity relationship and the secular            trends in obesity and diabetes. This work will also lay the foundation for           creation of effective primary prevention strategies by providing insight into        the processes through which social inequalities in health are created.

"Behavioral clustering in adolescents with STDs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Though the risk for STDs among adolescents is well described, knowledge of their sexual, drug-using and social networks is less well developed. In addition, the role of behavioral and psychosocial factors in transmission of STDs and blood borne infections (BBIs) has been considered primarily on the individual level, and rarely as group phenomena. In this study, we will explore whether the networks of young persons demonstrate assortative mixing with regard to behaviors and psychosocial characteristics as a function of infection with STDs and BBIs. Our specific aims are (1.1) to compare the egocentric networks of infected and non-infected boys and girls with regard to specific behaviors, psychosocial characteristics, and types of associations; (1.2) to compare the sociograms (connected subgraphs) created by joining index respondents who have ties in common; (1.3) to compare the changes in egocentric networks and sociograms among adolescent boys and adolescent girls over time; (1.4) to estimate the relative importance of behavioral/psychosocial factors vs. network factors in the acquisition of STDs/BBIs; and (2.0) to examine the  extent to which assortative or disassortative mixing with regard to personal behaviors and psychosocial  factors in groupings of adolescents is associated with network structure and with the occurrence of  STDs/BBIs. We propose enrolling 20 boys and 20 girls, age 15 years (10 each infected and uninfected), interviewing and testing them for STDs/BBIs six times over a 3 year period, and, at every other interview, eliciting contacts according to a fixed chain link design (total N=440 at every other interview). The resulting clusters and groupings will provide the basis for testing hypotheses that relate to the specific aims, primary among which are that network structure will exert an independent influence on the probability of infection, and that ""infected clusters"" (i.e. those in which the index respondent is infected) will demonstrate a greater degree of assortative mixing with regard to behavioral and psychosocial variables than uninfected clusters.  For this purpose, we will take advantage of the fact that the intraclass correlation coefficient and the design effect derived from it measure intracluster homogeneity and are thus a direct measure of assortative mixing within clusters. Demonstration of such phenomena will be of use in designing interventions that incorporate network information into their formulation.           ",Behavioral clustering in adolescents with STDs,7009967,R01HD043678,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' sexually transmitted disease ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' sex behavior ', ' social behavior ', ' psychometrics ', ' gender difference ', ' African American ', ' social support network ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' substance abuse related behavior ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,382803,0.09845550870973445
"Sexual Orientation and Health Disparities in Adolescence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healthy People 2010, the nation's essential document for setting the national agenda for health, identifies the persistence of health disparities across communities to be among the leading health challenges of our era. Recent studies suggest that the health of the nation's adolescent population may be patterned in important ways by sexual orientation group disparities. Depressive symptoms and low self-esteem have been proposed as underlying vulnerabilities driving elevated rates of risk behaviors in sexual minority adolescents. Rosario et al. propose a psychosocial Coming Out Process (COP) Model for adolescents in which dimensions of the process are linked with health behaviors. Additionally, drawing on Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), we propose that social norms in lesbian/bisexual female (LB) and gay/bisexual male (GB) communities also influence both positively and negatively health behaviors of sexual minority youth through processes of social learning. Family environment, an adolescent's age at the time of coming out, and presence or absence of preexisting psychosocial distress may be important factors influencing a young person's resiliency or risk and their experience with the coming out process. Research is needed to explore important predictors of the process of coming out and how this process relates to health behavior.       We will examine sexual orientation in association with weight concerns, disordered weight control behaviors, binge eating, and tobacco and alcohol use in adolescent girls and boys in the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), a longitudinal cohort study of 16,882 adolescents living across the U.S. In addition, we will examine factors that underlie the coming out process in adolescence, leading some to be more resilient while others have greater difficulties. Our specific aims are to compare the prevalence and severity over 4 years of follow-up of weight concerns and tobacco and alcohol use across sexual orientation groups among adolescent girls and boys and to empirically test the application of the COP Model and SCT to understand sexual orientation group disparities in health. We will examine prospectively the contribution of components of the COP Model and SCT in their relation to psychological distress and factors linked with LB and GB community social norms and orientation group differences in health outcomes.

"Contextual Determinants of HIV/STI Sexual Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Using data from a study of the sexual networks of African American urban adolescents in San Francisco, CA, and from the US Census, this application will be one of the first to assess how individual factors, network characteristics, and neighborhood socioeconomic context combine to create HIV and STI risk. It is particularly important to understand why minority adolescents living in resource-poor communities are vulnerable to STIs in the light of the inability of individual-level factors to fully explain disease risk in this population. This study aims 1) to identify sexual networks features that are associated with individual-level STI risk, controlling for individual-level demographic and behavioral risk factors, 2) to identify neighborhood level socioeconomic characteristics that are associated with individual-level STI risk, and 3) to determine if network- and individual-level characteristics mediate the relationship between neighborhood-level socioeconomic context and individual-level disease risk. Identification of risk factors at the individual, network and community levels will provide the targets necessary for the development of the next generation of multilevel interventions to prevent HIV and other STIs in disadvantaged communities.                 ",Contextual Determinants of HIV/STI Sexual Transmission,7064811,F31DA019848,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' sexually transmitted disease ', ' human subject ', ' HIV infection ', ' health behavior ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' interpersonal relations ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioenvironment ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' predoctoral investigator ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2006,39184,-0.0023439276267003305
"Parent Intervention in CBT for Depressed Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite progress in treating mental disorders in youth, little is known about these interventions with Latinos who are now the largest minority group in the United States. This study examines the impact of enhancing effective interventions through the involvement of parents in an 8 session of a psycho education intervention (PPI). This PPI will be incorporated into the 12-session CBT, a Cognitive Behavioral treatment method that has already been shown effective for the treatment of adolescent depression. This study will randomize 140 Latino adolescents with Major Depression to CBT with or without a PPI delivered in groups. Intake diagnoses will be obtained via structured diagnostic interviews (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-DISC for adolescents and Composite International Diagnostic Interview-CIDI for parents). The study will focus on Puerto Rican adolescents and their parents. The primary aims address both the efficacy and effectiveness of the intervention and treatments. Efficacy questions focus on the comparison of the active treatment with and without the PPI for reducing depressive symptoms and diagnosis (DISC) after 12 weeks of treatment and for preventing relapse over the course of one year post-treatment (DISC). Effectiveness questions focus on the impact of the treatment with or without the PPI on broader functional outcomes. Patient functional outcomes include general functioning status, family functioning, school attendance, and attrition rates. The relative value of CBT with and without the adjunctive parent intervention for improved parent functioning regarding psychiatric distress and symptoms, burden of patient illness, and work attendance will be examined. We hypothesize that the active treatment with PPI will be superior to no PPI in reducing depression at post treatment. Because the PPI is designed to involve parents and thus impact other aspects of the family system, this treatment is expected to produce better outcomes in several of the functional domains. To test the theoretical assumptions of the intervention, we also aim to examine the contribution of hypothesized treatment-specific change mechanisms to mediate the short-term outcome and predict long-term relapse over one year. This study responds to NIH and NIMH initiatives on decreasing disparities in health and mental health care between minorities and White populations and will contribute to our knowledge base.         ",Parent Intervention in CBT for Depressed Latino Youth,7245711,R01MH067893,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' clinical trial ', ' relapse /recurrence ', ' family structure /dynamics ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' mental disorder prevention ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' mental disorder diagnosis ', ' major depression ', ' Hispanic American ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' functional ability ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' patient oriented research ', ' mental health education ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO RIO PIEDRAS,R01,2006,108546,0.01208948216580988
"Adolescent Obesity: Academic-Community Partnership Conf*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal is designed to obtain the perspectives of 50 adolescents as well as 100 parents and community members about barriers to and effective community-based interventions for managing adolescent obesity. Obesity is the second leading cause of preventable disease in the United States and as such is a public health priority. Twenty-five percent of all adolescents are overweight or obese and of those seventy percent will become obese adults who are at risk for diabetes, hypertension, and cardiac disease. This proposal relies on the combined resources of Saint Paul's Missionary Baptist Church (serving a low income African American population), Ponderosa High School (a rural school serving a large number of Hispanic/Latino teens), California State University, Sacramento (CSUS, an EARDA school), and the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of California Davis (UCD, a research intensive school). Six focus groups aimed at identifying the causes of and solutions to adolescent obesity will be conducted. Phenomenology will be used to analyze the results of the focus groups and workshops will be designed based on those results. Nine workshops will be offered by CSUS' and UCD faculty members to promote healthy adolescent lifestyle choices and minimize obesity. A nationally known NIH funded researcher will also present a workshop on preventing and treating adolescent obesity. Subsequent focus groups will be held to evaluate the perspectives of teens, parents, and community leaders about the effectiveness of these 10 workshops as an intervention to minimize adolescent obesity. Planning groups will also be held to design a translational intervention grant targeting adolescent obesity. In summary, specific aims of the proposal include: 1) identifying and documenting adolescents', parents', and community leaders' views regarding the attitudes, beliefs, health behaviors, and lifestyle habits that influence adolescent eating and exercise habits, and 2) developing a translational intervention grant designed to minimize adolescent obesity at Saint Paul's Missionary Baptist Church and Ponderosa High School.

"Adolescent Preventive Services: Disparities and Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale and Objectives: Significant racial/ethnic disparities in health care utilization exist among adolescents. When adolescents do access the system, the preventive services delivery is below the recommended levels. However, little is known about racial/ethnic disparities in preventive services delivery. Minority adolescents have higher rates of risky health behaviors and associated outcomes in several key areas that are preventable. The long-term research objective is to decrease racial/ethnic disparities in adolescent health behaviors and outcomes. Specific aims are to determine if: 1) There are racial/ethnic disparities in the delivery of adolescent preventive services; 2) An intervention to increase the delivery of preventive services in primary care reduces racial/ethnic disparities in the receipt of preventive services; 3) Receipt of preventive services has a similar effect on adolescents of different racial/ethnic backgrounds. Research Design: Population: 2 samples will be utilized: 1) UCSF Sample: 3369 adolescents participated in an evaluation of adolescent preventive services in a large managed care organization; and 2) CHIS sample: 2898 California adolescents participated in The California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) in 2001. Measures: UCSF adolescent participants completed surveys immediately following clinical well care visits that queried whether providers screened and counseled them during the visit in 3 target areas: substance use, safety, and sexual behavior. A UCSF subsample also participated in a longitudinal study of health behaviors, completing health outcome and self-efficacy surveys prior to well visits and one year later at a 2nd annual well visit. CHIS participants completed phone surveys that included their attendance of well visits and whether their providers screened them in target areas. Methods: Secondary data analyses of these established data sets will be conducted to test for the presence of racial/ethnic disparities in adolescent preventive services and outcomes. We will conduct multiple regression and logistic regression analyses to examine the proposed aims. Outcomes for aims 1 and 2 are provider screening and counseling during well visits. Outcomes for aim 3 are behavior change and self- efficacy in the longitudinal subsample of adolescents who received preventive services. We will control for covariation from variables including adolescent characteristics, such as age and gender, and family characteristics, such as socio-economic status. Public Health Relevance: The identification of racial/ethnic disparities in preventive services delivery could increase awareness and prompt improvements in healthcare for all adolescents. The identification of disparities in health behavior and self-efficacy outcomes as the result of preventive services could lead to increased focus on meeting the needs of adolescents of differing racial/ethnic backgrounds.         ",Adolescent Preventive Services: Disparities and Outcomes,7128193,R03NR009397,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' managed care ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' health care service utilization ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' health behavior ', ' sex behavior ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' substance abuse related disorder ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' transportation /recreation safety ', ' ']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2006,73970,0.12877238806633884
"A Multilevel HIV-Prevention Strategy for High-Risk Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This multisite project provides a unique test of a multilevel HIV/STD prevention strategy for high-risk youth.  A total of 1600 African American adolescents, ages 12-16, will be recruited through CBOs in 4 cities, two in the Northeast (Providence and Syracuse) and two in the Southeast (Columbia and Macon), to participate in this HIV/STD prevention trial.  Adolescents will complete a baseline ACASI administered survey to assess their attitudes, beliefs and sexual behaviors, and provide a urine specimen for detection of three prevalent STDs.  Following baseline assessment, all adolescents will be randomly assigned to receive either the Focus on Kids HIV-prevention intervention or a General Health Promotion control. Subsequently, adolescents will be followed longitudinally and complete similar assessments at 6-, 12- and 18-months follow-up.  The second level of intervention involves tailored HIV/STD prevention messages through local mass media.  One city in each regional city-pair will be randomly assigned to receive the HIV prevention media campaign while the other city will serve as a control city (no media campaign).  Thus, the media messages will be directed to African American youth in only one of the two cities in each geographic region. The media program will deliver HIV-prevention messages that are culturally sensitive and age appropriate; these programs will promote both abstinence and risk reduction practices.  Cross-sectional surveys of 1200 African American youth using random-digit-dialing telephone interviews in the two cities that receive the media campaign and the two media control cities will be conducted over a 30-month period to determine the community-wide effects of the HIV media campaign.  This design will enable a test of the joint and separate effects of the two interventions over an 18-month follow-up for the youth participating in the small-group interventions.  In addition, the media campaign is predicted to independently enhance adolescents' adoption of HIV-preventive attitudes, beliefs and behaviors on a community-wide basis compared to youth in the non-media control cities.  Causal modeling methodology will be employed to assess the effects of the two levels of intervention and to identify the role of supportive messages received through the media and from peers that are predicted to maintain safer sexual behavior as adolescents mature.         ",A Multilevel HIV-Prevention Strategy for High-Risk Youth,7105547,U01MH066785,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' sexually transmitted disease ', ' cooperative study ', ' AIDS education /prevention ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' human subject ', ' information dissemination ', ' mass information media ', ' interview ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' sex behavior ', ' small social group ', ' African American ', ' community ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' safe sex /sex abstinence ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,U01,2006,1023656,0.07988026471049575

"ADHD: Detection and Service Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a chronic, often lifelong, psychiatric disorder with onset in early childhood. ADHD treatment disparities for affected African-American youth and for girls have been consistently documented, but the contributing factors in the help-seeking process are poorly understood.  The Institute of Medicine, in its recent recommendations on improving quality of care, stresses the importance of ensuring that patient values guide clinical interventions.  This competing renewal seeks to follow a cohort of youth into their adolescent years and to conduct a parallel quantitative and qualitative study to achieve the following three objectives:  1) To test three sets of hypotheses addressing predictors of continuities or discontinuities of ADHD treatment status from childhood to adolescence, and relevant adolescent outcomes on multiple levels (symptoms, functioning, consumer perspectives, environments, and systems).  2) The qualitative study component seeks to describe elements and experiences that have helped or hindered help-seeking for ADHD for two underserved groups: girls and African-American youth with ADHD.  Special emphasis will be given to the interplay between ADHD knowledge, the social network consultation process, and values and treatment preferences, to identify interventions aimed at reducing treatment disparities that respect patient values.  3) Intervention options identified in the qualitative study, along with professional treatment guidelines, will be tested for acceptability, feasibility, and perceived benefit in a survey to the entire cohort and randomly selected health and education professionals.   To achieve Objective 1, a longitudinal observational study, collecting parent, youth and teacher data will be conducted among a high-risk cohort of youth that have already been followed over the past 4 years.  The first two study phases will focus on treatment continuity and discontinuity in adolescence, and the last phase on outcomes.  For this last phase, a matched group of low-risk youth will be recruited from the original screening cohort of our first study.  To achieve Objective 2, experience sampling method (ESM) with eight youth, their parents and teachers will be used to develop themes and questions for 10 focus groups (FG), four for parents, four for youths, and two for teachers.  Cohort participants will be sampled for ESM and FG based on criterion sampling (ADHD treatment status, gender, and race).  Feedback forums after each data collection phase will enhance validity and trustworthiness of findings.  A framework of critical theory will guide open coding, domain analysis, critical incident method and political analysis, which represent the qualitative data analysis methods used in this study.  In addition, the focus will be on perceived beneficial steps that could be taken to improve the help-seeking experience from the perspectives of the youth, parents, and teachers, culminating in a summary of suggested intervention options to improve equitable access to treatment.  For Objective 3, these intervention options, along with a summary of professional treatment guidelines for ADHD, will be presented to the entire study cohort, school district teachers, and medical treatment providers in the form of a survey for assessment of acceptability, feasibility, and perceived benefits.  Survey findings will be processed in feedback forums in preparation of pilot interventions.

"Reducing Behavioral Health Disparities for Black Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract: Antisocial behavior and violence among youth has become a national health crisis for which African American youth are disproportionately at risk (Cicchetti & Lynch, 1993; Prothrow-Stith & Spivak,1992). A vast health disparity exists where African American youth are significantly more likely to both exhibit antisocial behavior and to be the victim of others' antisocial acts. For example, victimization rates for violent crimes are greater than 750% higher for African American adolescents compared to white adolescents (Centers for Disease Control, 2004; Rachuba, Stanton, & Howard, 1995). To further exacerbate this health disparity, there is a tremendous lack of culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions to combat the specific risk factors that foster antisocial behavior for African American youth. The limited availability of culturally relevant behavioral interventions for ethnic minority groups serves to create a barrier to accessing and utilizing mental health services by African Americans of all ages (Mandersheid & Sonnenschen, 1996). For example, African Americans under-consume community mental health services of all kinds, enter mental health treatment services at a later stage in the course of illness, and prematurely discontinue services at a significantly higher rate compared to white populations. To effectively combat the development of antisocial behavior among youth, cultural factors must be strategically and purposefully incorporated into program designs (Hill, Soriano, Chen, & LaFromboise, 1994). The goal of this project is to develop and test a child intervention curriculum specifically designed to be culturally relevant and effective for African American youth. This new intervention, entitled Black Parenting Strengths & Strategies-Child (BPSS-C), will build on an existing culturally modified parenting intervention curriculum, Black Parenting Strengths & Strategies (BPSS; Coard, 2003). The end product will represent an innovative, much needed resource for preventing and decreasing existing behavioral health disparities in   African American children (ages 5 to 8 years-old).             ",Reducing Behavioral Health Disparities for Black Youth,7163159,R43HD049938,"['young adult human (21-34) ', ' child behavior disorder ', ' child mental health service ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' child rearing ', ' family structure /dynamics ', ' human subject ', ' community mental health service ', ' health behavior ', ' problem solving ', ' social behavior ', ' African American ', ' culture ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' mental health education ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy design /development ', ' early /brief intervention /therapy ', ' ']",NICHD,3-C INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT,R43,2006,92980,0.009533478768191671
"Hispanic Stress Inventory Adolescent Immigrant and Non-Immigrant (HSI-A I/NI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic adolescents are at elevated risk for mental health and related behavioral problems. Culturally specific stress is associated with the risk for these problems. The objective of the proposed research is to develop a stress assessment inventory for Hispanic adolescents. This Phase II study builds upon the results of the Phase I feasibility study. The study will further validate and norm immigrant and non-immigrant versions of the Hispanic Stress Inventory-Adolescent (HSI- A.). A cross-sectional research design with a nested test-retest component and multisite, multimeasure features will be applied. A stratified sample of middle and high school students (N=1600) and clinical sample of adolescents with a diagnosed behavioral health problem will be selected (N=400) in 4 research sites representing the diversity of the United States Hispanic population: LosAngeles, Miami, Dallas and Boston. The 160 items developed in the Phase I study will be self administered to the adolescents along with the criterion measures and analysis will determine the standardized version of the HSI-A. The six objectives of this study of Hispanic early (13-15 years) and late adolescents (15-17 years) are: 1) To determine, through a series of exploratory factor analyses, the global construct validity and factor structures of the HSI-A immigrant and non- immigrant versions; 2) Estimate the construct validity of the final HSI-A by analyzing the similarities and differences in scale and subscale scores between the student sample and the clinically defined contrast group; 3) Assess the HSI-A for criterion-related validity using concurrent measures; 4) Assess the reliability of the HSI-A through the use of internal consistency, split-half and test-retest procedures; 5) Using survey data from a national sample of Hispanic adolescents, generate national normative data and actuarial profiles of the HSI-A; 6)Assess the reliability of the HSI-Athat includes web-based administration and scoring features as an integral part of the commercialization plan. The HSI-A will be marketed through a commercialization plan and will provide a screening tool for early detection of elevated stress and the prevention of the onset of mental health disorders by mental health professionals. The President's New Freedom Commission has recommended that the screening and early detection of mental disorders and the reduction of health disparities be priorities in the transformation of the nation's mental health system. The proposed research will address these two national public mental health needs through the development and commercialization of the Hispanic Stress Inventory - Adolescent. This new clinical screening tool will significantly increase the capacity of mental health professionals to prevent and reduce the risk in the vulnerable and rapidly growing population of Hispanic adolescents of serious mental health and behavioral problems through effective assessment of abnormal levels of stress.          ",Hispanic Stress Inventory Adolescent Immigrant and Non-Immigrant (HSI-A I/NI),7332904,R44MH073180,"['Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Provider ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Purpose ', ' Immigrant ', ' Phase II Clinical Trials ', ' phase II trial ', ' phase II protocol ', ' phase 2 trial ', ' Phase 2 Clinical Trials ', ' Nurses ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Physicians ', ' tool ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Small Business Funding Mechanisms ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Justice ', ' Language ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Psychologist ', ' instrument ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' English Language ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Event ', ' Score ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Services ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' high school ', ' Boston ', ' Structure ', ' prevention service ', ' technological innovation ', ' Prevention ', ' probation ', ' Reporting ', ' CD-ROM ', ' Compact Disk Read-Only Memory ', ' CDROM ', ' CD-ROM (Compact Disc-Read Only Memory) ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Businesses ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Climacteric ', ' life change ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' phase I trial ', ' phase I protocol ', ' phase 1 trial ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' commercial application ', ' commercialization ', ' ']",NIMH,"BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT, INC.",R44,2007,439088,0.01798204176636707
"""Development and Crash Injury Risk in Adolescent Latino Males""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unintentional injury remains the leading cause of death in children over age one. This is no different for children entering and traversing the adolescent period of life (age 10 - age 18). While adolescence has been described as a development period of strength and resilience, experts have highlighted the dual paradox that exists during this time of life. This dual paradox describes adolescence as a time of increased injury-related morbidity and mortality rates despite it also being a time of acquiring greater physical strength and capacity for decision-making. Because of their higher than expected mortality rate as they navigate the adolescent and emerging adult period of life, Latino adolescent males have been identified as the anomaly to the Latino Epidemiological Paradox. Cause of death during this time is largely attributed to motor vehicle crashes. The research proposed in this application will explore adolescent developmental sources of crash risk in the context of Latino and youth culture. The first component of this research program will involve analysis of data sets from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. It will provide longitudinal information on adolescent friend influence on risky driving behavior in the general population. The second component will involve comprehensive in-depth interviews of Latino adolescent males in order gain greater insight into Latino and youth culture and risky driving behavior. The last research component will utilize survey and diaries methodologies to elucidate the social context of risky driving in Latino adolescents and how this changes over the adolescent and emerging adult periods of life.  Successfully completing this training and research, the applicant will acquire a skill set needed to become an independent clinical investigator. Furthermore, the information gained will lead to broader understanding of injury disparity in Latino adolescent males and be applied to future development of a clinical contact injury prevention intervention.         ","""Development and Crash Injury Risk in Adolescent Latino Males""",7318222,K23HD050630,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' concept ', ' Health ', ' Depth ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Investigation ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' skills ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Friends ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Latino ', ' driving behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' injured ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K23,2007,123293,0.05304398261450578
"Maternal Influences & Adolescent Sexual Behaviors: AAPI & Caucasian    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long range goal of this study is to conduct community-based research that will contribute to the body of knowledge in nursing and health care delivery related to the AAPI and Caucasian populations. The objective of this study is to conduct a secondary analysis on the Add Health data set at two points of time (09/94 and 08/96) to test a preliminary model that was generated from the applicant's preliminary study (4 focus group interviews). The theoretical framework has the potential to explain and predict the relationships among AAPI mothers' and adolescents' perceptions of their interactions, adolescents' perceived maternal sexual expectations (APMSE), and age at the first sexual initiation. The theoretical framework also can be used as a basis for understanding different cultural influences on adolescents' sexual behaviors by comparing AAPI adolescents with those of their Caucasian peers. The specific aims of this study are 1) to explore the relationships among AAPI mothers' and adolescents' perceptions of their interactions, APMSE, and age at first sexual initiation; 2) to examine whether the relationships among AAPI mothers' and adolescents' perceptions of their interactions, APMSE, and age at first sexual initiation vary according to gender and the level of acculturation; 3) to compare the relationships among AAPI mothers' and adolescents' perceptions of their interactions, APMSE, and age at first sexual initiation with those of their Caucasian peers. The relevance of this project to public health is to bridge the sexual health care disparities among AAPI adolescents. The common perception that Asian Americans are a ""model minority"" has led the public to believe that this population does not have health related problems. However, in reality, this group has health needs that are as serious as those of other ethnic and racial groups, such as pressure related to overcoming differences in appearance and cultural practices. Little is known about these adolescents' decision making processes in terms of their maternal influences, particularly in relation to their sexual initiation. By understanding and comparing the influences of APMSE with those of Caucasians, nursing professionals could bridge the knowledge gaps and develop effective interventions for this long overlooked population. This proposed study fits into the National Institute of Nursing Research priority area of health promotion during developmental transitions (i.e., adolescents) and the development of culturally sensitive intervention programs for the AAPI population. This study is fundamental to the design of a family intervention to improve mother-adolescent interactions, enhance adolescents' sexual health behaviors, and ultimately decrease sexual health care disparities for AAPI adolescents.           ",Maternal Influences & Adolescent Sexual Behaviors: AAPI & Caucasian,7334286,F31NR010174,"['Family dynamics ', ' family structure/dynamics ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' residence ', ' teenage mother ', ' teenage mom ', ' teen mother ', ' teen mom ', ' adolescent mother ', ' Literature ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' male ', ' Mothers ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Perception ', ' pressure ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Taboo ', ' Testing ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Time ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Belief ', ' intervention program ', ' Proxy ', ' expectation ', ' peer ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Gender ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Purpose ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Range ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Family ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2007,21041,0.09940362428432355
"Family Centered Advance Care Planning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goals are to enhance quality of life and to integrate effective EOL care throughout the course of treatment for adolescents living with HIV/AIDS, as well as to test an intervention to support HIV positive adolescents and their family members in order to prevent depression and anxiety. These goals are consistent with the NIH 2006 Plan for HIV Related Research (NIH, 2004, pp. 260-261). Our specific aims are 1) to adapt and standardize interventions already established as efficacious for use with a new group: HIV positive adolescents and their families;2) to pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of the Family Centered ACP intervention;3) to estimate the effect of the intervention on adaptive coping, psychological adjustment, quality of life, plans. Stage of illness will also be studied. More than 30,000 adolescents in the U. S. die annually from the effects of all chronic illnesses (Mineno, et al., 2002). EOL care for these patients is a public health issue (Freyer, 2004; Rao, et al., 2002), because of its high burden and potential for the prevention of suffering. We will recruit from two sites and enroll 40 (N=80) adolescent/legal guardian or surrogate dyads. Temporarily not ready dyads will be placed in an observational group. We will randomly assign 35 dyads to either the Family Centered ACP intervention (n=20) or the Adolescent Health Control (n=15). The format is three 60 to 90 minute sessions: (1) structured EOL survey; (2) Family Centered ACP interview; (3) optional Family Problem Solving. Standardized, self-report measures will be administered at baseline, immediate post intervention and 3 month follow-up. To assess the feasibility and acceptance of the intervention in Aim 2, frequency distributions in Stata 8 will be used to estimate each of the indicators of performance from enrollment to data completeness. Analysis of covariance models will be used to estimate the effect of the intervention on hypothesized outcomes in Aim 3. The NIH Strategic Plan (IOM, 2003) to reduce health disparities is relevant to this study, which aims to improve the quality of life for a condition that disproportionately affects minorities, as is the NIH Statement on Improving EOL Care (Dec.6-8, 2004) to increase the study of minorities and children who are underrepresented in EOL research. Careful research in psychologically sensitive areas such as EOL care is consistent with IOM recommendations (IOM, 2002) and the NIH Roadmap intention to discourage ""risk-adverse"" research and to encourage innovation (IOM, 2003).

"A Community-Academic Partnership to Address Disparities*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  As outlined in Healthy People 2010, eliminating health disparities, especially with respect to child obesity, is a major U.S. goal.  Obesity rates among youth have been rising dramatically in recent years, with a concomitant rise in the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  In Los Angles County, the site of our proposed study, the prevalence of obesity among African-American and Latino teenagers is about 50% higher than for White teenagers; available data for Asian/Pacific Islander youth also suggest disparities.  Limited physical activity and poor diet contribute to obesity and are prevalent among youth from all racial/ethnic groups, but especially among African Americans and Latinos.  We propose a three-year community-based participatory research project to develop and pilot test an intervention that addresses racial/ethnic disparities in obesity among adolescents in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).  We aim to (1) build a strong community-academic partnership and assess community needs and priorities for obesity-related programs among adolescents through effective collaboration among LAUSD staff, researchers, and key community stakeholders; (2.) jointly design a pilot intervention to reduce/prevent obesity among adolescents of diverse race/ethnicity through such potential strategies as increasing physical activity and/or healthy eating behaviors; and (3) pilot test the feasibility and effects of the intervention among adolescents of diverse race/ethnicity.  To accomplish these aims, we will build upon an existing collaboration among LAUSD, the UCLA/RAND Center for Adolescent Health Promotion, and stakeholders in an ethnically and racially-diverse community-the Carson-Wilmington area of LA. LAUSD and community stakeholders have identified addressing adolescent obesity as a high priority. We will conduct extensive formative work, including qualitative interviews, focus groups, site visits, and surveys with community stakeholders, to assess priorities and potential strategies for addressing adolescent obesity; we will use this information to design and pilot test an intervention uniquely tailored to the community.  We anticipate revising the intervention based on pilot results and seeking additional funds to conduct a full evaluation throughout LAUSD.  We also anticipate that the community-academic partnership and infrastructure developed during this process will allow us to continue to collaborate in addressing health disparities facing the youth of LA.         ",A Community-Academic Partnership to Address Disparities*,7247128,R24MD001648,"['Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Site Visit ', ' Rate ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Process ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Physical Education ', ' Prevalence Study ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Behavior ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' Body Weight ', ' elementary school ', ' intervention program ', ' California ', ' member ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' County ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Instruction ', ' obesity prevention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' health empowerment ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' community safety ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R24,2007,684383,0.11967475554002055
"Sexual Relationship Power and HIV Risk Behavior in Adolescent Girls    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent girls in violent or controlling relationships are likely to be at higher risk for HIV and STIs. Their risk of relationship violence or power imbalances may be greater when the partner is two or more years older. The purpose of this study is to test a proposed model of the correlations between sexual relationship power and intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV risk related sexual behaviors in a sample of at-risk adolescent girls. The model is derived from Blanc's evidence-based framework for assessing the relationship between gender power relations and reproductive health in populations as risk for power imbalances. Specifically, the study aims to investigate the relationship of sexual partners' age discordance of more than two years to high-risk sexual behavior, in adolescent girls ages 14-18, as well as the mediating role of sexual relationship power and IPV in that relationship. A cross-sectional, descriptive, survey design will be used to evaluate the model of Proposed Predictors of Sexual Risk in Adolescent Girls. Data will be collected from 150 sexually active adolescent girls at an urban school-based health center, in a low-income neighborhood. Data collection will be done via a self-administered, computer-assisted survey, Promote Health, which will analyze responses and format a report with health information, referrals, and resources specific to the individual participant. Data will be analyzed for main effects of demographic variables, including age of adolescent girl, race/ethnicity and acculturation status, and history of physical or sexual abuse. If main effects are determined, then these factors will be controlled for in regression analysis. The role of sexual relationship power and IPV as mediators of the relationship among partner age discordance and high risk sexual behaviors will be determined through multiple regression analysis. Sub-analyses will be conducted to further investigate the correlations among variables, for example sexual relationship power and IPV. The proposed research questions are critical in addressing the needs for early intervention in HIV/STD prevention for adolescent girls, who are at high risk for IPV and one of the fastest growing groups infected with HIV and other STIs. Understanding the prevalence and effects of power imbalances in romantic relationships is essential in developing strategies to reduce HIV, other STIs, and IPV. If relationship factors, such as age discordance, relative power, and violence increase the likelihood of sexual risk behaviors in at-risk adolescent girls, this knowledge can be used to shape questions asked in clinical risk assessment, and to develop prevention interventions and public health policy.          ",Sexual Relationship Power and HIV Risk Behavior in Adolescent Girls,7421118,F31MH082646,"['Data Collection ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Elder Abuse ', ' senior abuse ', ' elderly abuse ', ' abuse of older adults ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Rate ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Laws ', ' statutory rape ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Early Intervention (Education) ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' sex abuse ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rosa ', ' Rose ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Behavior ', ' age group ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' community intervention ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' relationship violence ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,F31,2007,27871,0.05585291241231924
"RESEARCH AND TRAINING ON CONTEXTUAL EFFECTS IMPACTING ADOLESCENT HEALTH    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 will allow the PI to establish an independent career in public health and to help her achieve her career goal to conduct research that explains a variety of health outcomes and disparities in outcomes, in terms of the role of modifiable factors in the local environmental context. The candidate is applying for the award to gain extensive training and experience in social and spatial epidemiology, including multilevel modeling, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and the built environment, analysis of complex survey design data, and adolescent health. The knowledge and experience obtained will be used to investigate the role of the physical and social macro-environments on adolescent behavior substance use, physical activity, and dietary habits. Despite the growth in empirical research on neighborhood environmental characteristics and their influence on adolescent health behaviors, much remains to be learned. Many researchers have not gone beyond the two-level conceptualizations of a multilevel model, yet it is reasonable to assume that adolescent health is influenced by numerous levels. Adolescents will be nested not only within their neighborhoods but also within their family or household unit providing a unique and rare opportunity to examine multiple levels of influence. Although there have been calls to modify environments to reduce negative health outcomes, most work has focused on the micro-environment (e.g., home, school influences). This study will use the unique opportunity of georeferenced national survey data on a racially diverse sample of adolescents included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Primary Aims are:1) to develop neighborhood-level measures that characterize physical and social neighborhood factors thought to influence adolescent health behavior; 2) to evaluate whether characteristics of the physical and social environment explain a substantial proportion of the variance in adolescent health behaviors; 3) to determine moderators of the association between the physical and social environment and adolescent health behavior; and 4) to identify racial and ethnic disparities in health behavior and to examine whether physical and characteristics of the neighborhood where an adolescent resides explains disparities. The skills gained during the proposed training will provide the candidate with the requisite training to become a strong independent investigator in neighborhood influences on health and specifically, adolescent health.           ",RESEARCH AND TRAINING ON CONTEXTUAL EFFECTS IMPACTING ADOLESCENT HEALTH,7394734,K01SH000002,[''],NCHS,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,K01,2007,130340,0.09184049337315198
"Parent Intervention in CBT for Depressed Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite progress in treating mental disorders in youth, little is known about these interventions with Latinos who are now the largest minority group in the United States. This study examines the impact of enhancing effective interventions through the involvement of parents in an 8 session of a psycho education intervention (PPI). This PPI will be incorporated into the 12-session CBT, a Cognitive Behavioral treatment method that has already been shown effective for the treatment of adolescent depression. This study will randomize 140 Latino adolescents with Major Depression to CBT with or without a PPI delivered in groups. Intake diagnoses will be obtained via structured diagnostic interviews (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-DISC for adolescents and Composite International Diagnostic Interview-CIDI for parents). The study will focus on Puerto Rican adolescents and their parents. The primary aims address both the efficacy and effectiveness of the intervention and treatments. Efficacy questions focus on the comparison of the active treatment with and without the PPI for reducing depressive symptoms and diagnosis (DISC) after 12 weeks of treatment and for preventing relapse over the course of one year post-treatment (DISC). Effectiveness questions focus on the impact of the treatment with or without the PPI on broader functional outcomes. Patient functional outcomes include general functioning status, family functioning, school attendance, and attrition rates. The relative value of CBT with and without the adjunctive parent intervention for improved parent functioning regarding psychiatric distress and symptoms, burden of patient illness, and work attendance will be examined. We hypothesize that the active treatment with PPI will be superior to no PPI in reducing depression at post treatment. Because the PPI is designed to involve parents and thus impact other aspects of the family system, this treatment is expected to produce better outcomes in several of the functional domains. To test the theoretical assumptions of the intervention, we also aim to examine the contribution of hypothesized treatment-specific change mechanisms to mediate the short-term outcome and predict long-term relapse over one year. This study responds to NIH and NIMH initiatives on decreasing disparities in health and mental health care between minorities and White populations and will contribute to our knowledge base.         ",Parent Intervention in CBT for Depressed Latino Youth,7239480,R01MH067893,"['Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Intake ', ' International ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Affect ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Psychiatric Hospitals ', ' mental health facility ', ' Mental Institutions ', ' Mental Hospitals ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Interview ', ' Distress ', ' Numbers ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Week ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' social ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' relapse prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' psychoeducation ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' 14 year old ', ' fourteen year old ', ' age 14 years ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO RIO PIEDRAS,R01,2007,518676,0.01208948216580988
"Enacted Stigma, Gender & Risk Behaviors of School Youth Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and questioning (GLBQ) youth are at increased risk for health disparities, including HIV and teen pregnancy, vs. heterosexual peers, a risk attributed to the effects of nearly universal stigma for sexual minorities. Behaviors in a social group that convey or enforce stigma are enacted stigma; culture influences stigma, yet gender and ethnic variations in enacted stigma have seldom been examined among youth. Enacted stigma in school has been measured only indirectly in large-scale school-based surveys. To develop effective interventions, we need to understand enacted stigma among different cultural groups, develop culturally competent, reliable measures, and test the links between stigma and health behaviors in population-based surveys. Although GLBQ stigma is our primary focus, understanding how other types of stigma are enacted is important in developing general measures of enacted stigma.  Therefore, the purpose of this 5-year, mixed-methods international study is to explore enacted stigma behaviors among indigenous, Asian-ancestry, and European-ancestry adolescents in school environments in Canada, New Zea- land, and the US, to develop cross-cultural measures of enacted stigma for adolescent health surveys, and to examine the association of types of stigma and HIV risk behaviors among adolescents. The specific aims are:  I. To compare the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors associated with sexual orientation and other stigmatized identi- ties among youth in existing large-scale school-based surveys, and to identify both the existing indirect measures of stigma that are risk factors plus the protective factors significantly associated with the HIV risk behaviors.  II. To identify the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors and associated risk and protective factors among indigenous adolescents--American Indian (US), First Nations (Canada), Maori (New Zealand--as well as youth of Asian ancestry in each country, and to compare the patterns among adolescents of similar ethnic backgrounds in the 3 countries.  III. To explore among adolescent and adult key informants the ways stigma is understood, assigned, and enforced in the school environment, and to compare the patterns within the three countries. This exploration will be focused pri- marily on stigma based on sexual orientation status, but other types of stigmatized identities will be examined to under- stand the similarities and differences of how stigma is enacted, and the potential utility of generic stigma measures.  IV. Within each country, to elicit explanatory models from adolescents and youth workers on the survey findings of HIV risk behaviors and stigma, and to tap suggested strategies for reducing stigma and addressing sexual risk behaviors in culturally appropriate ways among GLBQ youth.  V. Incorporating the findings of aims I-IV, to develop, pilot, and psychometrically evaluate universal and country- specific culturally competent items and scales, for population-based adolescent health surveys, that measure perceived and enacted stigma in school, to allow cross-cul_ral comparisons of the effects of stigma among adolescents.

"Obesity in Minority Youth in Los Angeles: A Generation ""At Risk""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall Focus: We propose a Comprehensive NCMHD Research Center of Excellence focused on obesity in Minority Youth. This center will focus on research, translation and training to improve minority health in Hispanic and African American youth, with a major focus on exploring innovative ways to identify, prevent and reduce minority health disparities related to obesity, especially type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This center is based on the principle that obesity and associated disease risk is apparent early in life, and therefore novel interventions early in life are essential public health strategies to reduce the burden of disease-risk into adulthood. Organization: The center, with broad support from the university and its affiliate, the Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, will be led by Michael I. Goran, PhD and Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, PhD, who between them have an impressive track record in minority health research. The Administrative Core will assume leadership on all programmatic and fiscal matters and provide shared resources for data management, subject recruitment, common assays, community translation, and training and mentoring. The Research Core will provide scientific leadership and integration across three synergistic RO1-type projects that share subjects (Hispanic and African American teenagers) and methods, and have both within and between project hypotheses. Project #1 (PI: D Spruijt-Metz) will examine the hypothesis that high sugar meals contribute to fat deposition through an abnormal hormonal milieu that promotes negative moods and low physical activity levels. Project #2 (PI: V Gilsanze) will use an array of advanced imaging techniques to examine the ectopic fat hypothesis in minority adolescents by assessment of various fat depots (subcutaneous, visceral, muscle, liver and pancreas) and intima media thickness across the cascade of disease progression in minority adolescents (lean -> healthy obese -> obese with pre-diabetes -> obese with type 2 diabetes). Project #3 (PI: C Roberts) will examine the hypothesis that resistance training is an ""effective"" exercise intervention for improving insulin sensitivity, ectopic fat, and other risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in minority adolescents. Pilot Study #1 will examine gene expression profiles from various fat depots in obese Hispanic and African American adults undergoing surgical weight loss. Pilot Study #2 will translate the intervention in Project 3 for utility in a home environment. Summary & Significance. The center will support a nexus of health researchers dedicated to reducing obesity-related health disparities in minority youth. The center will provide new information and training that is scalable to community settings and unique programs that will elucidate the biological, behavioral and metabolic factors contributing to obesity and related disease-risk in Hispanic and African American children.          ","Obesity in Minority Youth in Los Angeles: A Generation ""At Risk""",7277038,P60MD002254,[''],NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,P60,2007,1497645,0.06561596150218904

"Adolescent Obesity: Academic-Community Partnership Conferences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal is designed to obtain the perspectives of 50 adolescents as well as 100 parents and community members about barriers to and effective community-based interventions for managing adolescent obesity. Obesity is the second leading cause of preventable disease in the United States and as such is a public health priority. Twenty-five percent of all adolescents are overweight or obese and of those seventy percent will become obese adults who are at risk for diabetes, hypertension, and cardiac disease. This proposal relies on the combined resources of Saint Paul's Missionary Baptist Church (serving a low income African American population), Ponderosa High School (a rural school serving a large number of Hispanic/Latino teens), California State University, Sacramento (CSUS, an EARDA school), and the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of California Davis (UCD, a research intensive school). Six focus groups aimed at identifying the causes of and solutions to adolescent obesity will be conducted. Phenomenology will be used to analyze the results of the focus groups and workshops will be designed based on those results. Nine workshops will be offered by CSUS' and UCD faculty members to promote healthy adolescent lifestyle choices and minimize obesity. A nationally known NIH funded researcher will also present a workshop on preventing and treating adolescent obesity. Subsequent focus groups will be held to evaluate the perspectives of teens, parents, and community leaders about the effectiveness of these 10 workshops as an intervention to minimize adolescent obesity. Planning groups will also be held to design a translational intervention grant targeting adolescent obesity. In summary, specific aims of the proposal include: 1) identifying and documenting adolescents', parents', and community leaders' views regarding the attitudes, beliefs, health behaviors, and lifestyle habits that influence adolescent eating and exercise habits, and 2) developing a translational intervention grant designed to minimize adolescent obesity at Saint Paul's Missionary Baptist Church and Ponderosa High School. These specific aims are planned to establish a community-academic partnership capable of reducing the health disparities associated with adolescent obesity in two low-income communities.             ",Adolescent Obesity: Academic-Community Partnership Conferences,7289284,U13HD052406,"['Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Rural ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Saints ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Clinical Nurse Specialists ', ' Nurse Clinicians ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Parents ', ' Baptist Church ', ' Baptists ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Schools ', ' Stigmata ', ' Solutions ', ' Research Priority ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Award ', ' Belief ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' California ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Missionary ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Community Medicine ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Address ', ' International ', ' Range ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Priorities ', ' teenage parent ', ' teen parents ', ' teen parent ', ' Population ', ' therapeutic effectiveness ', ' translational study ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' ']",NICHD,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SACRAMENTO,U13,2007,30000,0.15705186539528168
"DEVELOPMENTAL AND TESTING OF A JAMAICAN MOTHER-DAUGHTER HIV RISK-REDUCED PROGRAM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Caribbean nations, including Jamaica, exhibit HIV rates that are second only to sub-Saharan Africa. Jamaican young women and adolescent girls are at particularly high risk due to a number of cultural factors, gender norms, partnering with older male partners, and lack of knowledge and skills related to sexual refusal and HIV prevention. U.S. studies have shown that mothers may act as a key influence of their daughters' sexual risk beliefs and behaviors. However, no studies have documented these effects outside of the U.S. and no studies have evaluated HIV risk-reduction interventions with Jamaican adolescent girls and their mothers. Hence, the purpose of the proposed project is to partner with the University of the West Indies, Jamaican community based organizations (CBOs) and families in order to develop and test a culture-specific mother-daughter HIV risk-reduction intervention in a randomized pilot field experiment. Specifically, we propose to test whether a culture-specific, theory-based, skill-building intervention with Jamaican adolescent girls and their mothers can directly and/or indirectly reduce these girls' HIV risk-associated sexual behaviors. Jamaican girls, ages 14-18, and their mothers/female guardians will be recruited from CBOs and randomly assigned to either: (a) a mother-daughter HIV risk-reduction intervention condition or (b) a ""no intervention"" control condition. The HIV risk-reduction intervention includes 8 modules scheduled over 2 days and implemented by trained adult Jamaican women recruited from among CBO staff. The mother component is designed to increase parenting behaviors (e.g., parental monitoring, parent-child sexual communication [PCSC]) associated with reduced adolescent sexual risk-taking; the teen component is designed to improve girls' beliefs and skills related to abstinence, sexual negotiation and condom use. A ""no intervention"" control condition is being employed as the proposed project is a pilot study of the HIV risk-reduction intervention. Primary outcomes include mothers'/daughters' reports of parenting behaviors and daughters' self-reports of sexual risk behaviors (sexual intercourse, unprotected sex, condom use, number of partners). Secondary outcomes include mothers' beliefs regarding parenting behaviors and daughters beliefs regarding sexual risk behaviors-the theoretical mediators of intervention effects.

"Sexual Orientation and Health Disparities in Adolescence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healthy People 2010, the nation's essential document for setting the national agenda for health, identifies the persistence of health disparities across communities to be among the leading health challenges of our era. Recent studies suggest that the health of the nation's adolescent population may be patterned in important ways by sexual orientation group disparities. Depressive symptoms and low self-esteem have been proposed as underlying vulnerabilities driving elevated rates of risk behaviors in sexual minority adolescents. Rosario et al. propose a psychosocial Coming Out Process (COP) Model for adolescents in which dimensions of the process are linked with health behaviors. Additionally, drawing on Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), we propose that social norms in lesbian/bisexual female (LB) and gay/bisexual male (GB) communities also influence both positively and negatively health behaviors of sexual minority youth through processes of social learning. Family environment, an adolescent's age at the time of coming out, and presence or absence of preexisting psychosocial distress may be important factors influencing a young person's resiliency or risk and their experience with the coming out process. Research is needed to explore important predictors of the process of coming out and how this process relates to health behavior.       We will examine sexual orientation in association with weight concerns, disordered weight control behaviors, binge eating, and tobacco and alcohol use in adolescent girls and boys in the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), a longitudinal cohort study of 16,882 adolescents living across the U.S. In addition, we will examine factors that underlie the coming out process in adolescence, leading some to be more resilient while others have greater difficulties. Our specific aims are to compare the prevalence and severity over 4 years of follow-up of weight concerns and tobacco and alcohol use across sexual orientation groups among adolescent girls and boys and to empirically test the application of the COP Model and SCT to understand sexual orientation group disparities in health. We will examine prospectively the contribution of components of the COP Model and SCT in their relation to psychological distress and factors linked with LB and GB community social norms and orientation group differences in health outcomes.

"ADHD: Detection and Service Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a chronic, often lifelong, psychiatric disorder with onset in early childhood. ADHD treatment disparities for affected African-American youth and for girls have been consistently documented, but the contributing factors in the help-seeking process are poorly understood.  The Institute of Medicine, in its recent recommendations on improving quality of care, stresses the importance of ensuring that patient values guide clinical interventions.  This competing renewal seeks to follow a cohort of youth into their adolescent years and to conduct a parallel quantitative and qualitative study to achieve the following three objectives:  1) To test three sets of hypotheses addressing predictors of continuities or discontinuities of ADHD treatment status from childhood to adolescence, and relevant adolescent outcomes on multiple levels (symptoms, functioning, consumer perspectives, environments, and systems).  2) The qualitative study component seeks to describe elements and experiences that have helped or hindered help-seeking for ADHD for two underserved groups: girls and African-American youth with ADHD.  Special emphasis will be given to the interplay between ADHD knowledge, the social network consultation process, and values and treatment preferences, to identify interventions aimed at reducing treatment disparities that respect patient values.  3) Intervention options identified in the qualitative study, along with professional treatment guidelines, will be tested for acceptability, feasibility, and perceived benefit in a survey to the entire cohort and randomly selected health and education professionals.   To achieve Objective 1, a longitudinal observational study, collecting parent, youth and teacher data will be conducted among a high-risk cohort of youth that have already been followed over the past 4 years.  The first two study phases will focus on treatment continuity and discontinuity in adolescence, and the last phase on outcomes.  For this last phase, a matched group of low-risk youth will be recruited from the original screening cohort of our first study.  To achieve Objective 2, experience sampling method (ESM) with eight youth, their parents and teachers will be used to develop themes and questions for 10 focus groups (FG), four for parents, four for youths, and two for teachers.  Cohort participants will be sampled for ESM and FG based on criterion sampling (ADHD treatment status, gender, and race).  Feedback forums after each data collection phase will enhance validity and trustworthiness of findings.  A framework of critical theory will guide open coding, domain analysis, critical incident method and political analysis, which represent the qualitative data analysis methods used in this study.  In addition, the focus will be on perceived beneficial steps that could be taken to improve the help-seeking experience from the perspectives of the youth, parents, and teachers, culminating in a summary of suggested intervention options to improve equitable access to treatment.  For Objective 3, these intervention options, along with a summary of professional treatment guidelines for ADHD, will be presented to the entire study cohort, school district teachers, and medical treatment providers in the form of a survey for assessment of acceptability, feasibility, and perceived benefits.  Survey findings will be processed in feedback forums in preparation of pilot interventions.  The study occurs in partnership with the school district and an advisory board of school professionals, parents, and youth.  The research team has an extensive track record of success with similar study designs and will use innovative technologies to adhere to an efficient management plan.

"Social Messages and Teen Sexual Health: Voices of Urban African American Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Teen pregnancy and childbearing have negative social consequences for adolescents, for their children, and for society. Pregnant teens are less likely to receive adequate prenatal care and more likely to give birth to low-birth weight infants. Teen mothers are at increased risk of school drop out and chronic poverty. Children of teen mothers tend to be hospitalized more often, have more chronic health problems, and more behavioral problems. Teenage childbearing is also associated with high costs for society. In Minneapolis, the majority of long-term welfare recipients are families that began with a teen birth, and these families account for a large percentage of the most costly families supported by the state. The goal of the proposed study is to explore from the perspectives of low-income, urban African American young women how social messages influenced their perceptions and experiences of sexual behavior and childbearing as adolescents. The following aims guide the proposed study: I. Compare sources and content of social messages regarding adolescent sexual behavior and pregnancy from the perspectives of urban, low-income African American young women who have and have not given birth during adolescence II. Describe ways in which social messages received during adolescence influenced participants' sexual behaviors and beliefs about pregnancy timing. Findings from this study will contribute to understanding the ways in which social contexts influence the sexual health of urban, low-income African American girls. The perspectives and experiences of these young women can be utilized to guide culturally and socially relevant research, policy and interventions to address significant racial disparities in adolescent childbearing and associated public health outcomes. The proposed study will use a focused ethnography approach. Focus groups and individual interviews will be conducted with a purposive, nominated sample of twelve African American young women ages 18 to 22. These young women will be asked to reflect upon their adolescence. In addition, field notes will be recorded. The proposed study will be conducted with the guidance of established community consultants.           ",Social Messages and Teen Sexual Health: Voices of Urban African American Youth,7329228,F31NR010182,"['Decision Making ', ' Childbirth ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Family ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Depth ', ' Chronic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Influentials ', ' Interview ', ' Individual ', ' teenage mother ', ' teenage mom ', ' teen mother ', ' teen mom ', ' adolescent mother ', ' African ', ' Literature ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Mollies ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Rate ', ' Prenatal care ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexuality ', ' Single Parent ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social Perception ', ' Social Welfare ', ' welfare ', ' Societies ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Time ', ' Attitude ', ' Voice ', ' Woman ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Patient currently pregnant ', ' gravid Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy not delivered ', ' Gravid ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' pregnant teen ', ' pregnant adolescent ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' desire ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' teen birth ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' child bearing ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2007,34572,0.04002273860283977
"MOTHER /DAUGHTER HIV RISK REDUCTION INTERVENTION Though HIV risk reduction interventions delivered by health experts have generally proven successful, their success has not significantly reduced the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic among African American adolescent girls, especially low-income girls from single mother headed homes, who are at high risk for contracting HIV. While several researchers have advocated that active parental involvement may have a more profound effect on HIV risk reduction, they also note that parents have inadequate skills to assist their adolescents. Few programs have tested the effectiveness of preparing mothers with the knowledge and skills needed to assist their daughters to develop HIV risk reduction behavior. The specific aim is to examine systematically over a two-year period the effectiveness of the Mother/Daughter HIV Risk Reduction Intervention in increasing daughter's self-reported HIV risk reduction behavior: delay of sexual activity and if sexually active, either refrain from sex or consistently use condoms and have fewer sex partners. A split-piloted repeated measures design will be used to compare the treatment intervention, the Mother/Daughter HIV Risk Reduction Intervention (MDRR), with two control groups: the Health Expert HIV Risk Reduction Intervention (HERR) and the Mother/Daughter Health Promotion Intervention (MDHP). Guided by the African American Daughter HIV Risk Reduction conceptual framework that is based on social cognitive theory, theory of reasoned action, womanist theory, black feminist thought, African womanism, and bioecological development theory, the research utilizes a convenience sample of low- income inner city adolescent females who range in age from 11-14: 184 mother/daughter pairs in MDRR, 184 mother/daughter pairs in MDHP, and 184 daughters in HERR. The interventions will be randomly assigned to one of three demographically similar but geographically distinct study settings. The adolescents' mothers deliver the content in MDRR and MDHP and the research staff delivers the content in HERR. The content for MDRR and HERR focuses on HIV risk reduction skills while the content for MDHP focuses on nutrition and exercise. Mothers receive intensive group training from the research staff before they tach in a group setting the content to their daughters. Mother/daughter pairs and daughters will be assessed at pre- and post intervention and biannually for 24 months. Multiple logistic regression, multiple linear regression, and proportional hazard models will be used to analyze the data.

"Prime Time: Health Promotion for Multiple Risk Behaviors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prime Time: Health Promotion for Multiple Risk Behaviors is a five-year intervention research study (2005-2009) with an overall goal to design, implement and evaluate a multi-component intervention among adolescent girls at high risk for early pregnancy that reduces multiple precursors of teen pregnancy including sexual risk taking, violence involvement, and school disconnection. Prime Time targets 13-17 year old girls (n=250) attending school and community clinics in Minneapolis/St Paul who meet specified risk criteria. Using an experimental design, half of study participants are randomly assigned to the intervention condition; half are assigned to the control condition. Intervention participants will be involved with the Prime Time intervention for an 18-month period, while control participants will continue to receive usual clinic services. Self-report data will be collected (via A-CASI surveys) from all study participants at study baseline and at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months following study enrollment. To address core risk and protective factors related to sexual risk behaviors, violence involvement, and school disconnection, the Prime Time intervention employs an innovative combination of previously-tested approaches including one-on-one case management, peer education (Just In Time) and service learning (It's Our Time) experiences. This multi-component intervention was developed and field-tested in the Prime Time pilot study. Using multi-wave data, we evaluate intervention impacts on participants' sexual risk taking and contraceptive behaviors; school connectedness, school misbehavior and school performance; violence involvement and peer-related aggression. We also test the extent to which intervention effects on outcome behaviors are mediated by hypothesized risk and protective factors targeted for change by the Prime Time intervention. If the intervention demonstrates success in preventing risk behaviors, we will actively engage in dissemination efforts to affect best practices in primary care clinics serving adolescent girls.            ",Prime Time: Health Promotion for Multiple Risk Behaviors,7236660,R01NR008778,"['Pattern ', ' Hormonal ', ' Behavior ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Emotional ', ' Case Management ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Interpersonal Violence ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' child bearing ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Contraception Behavior ', ' Contraceptive Behavior ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Control Groups ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Intelligence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Partner Communications ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Politics ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Factors ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Social Problems ', ' social disturbance ', ' Societies ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Resolution ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Just-in-time-concept ', ' Monitor ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' F Factor ', ' sex factor ', ' fertility factor ', ' Sex Factor F ', ' Resistance Transfer Factor ', ' F Plasmids ', ' Bacterial Sex Factor ', ' Bacterial Fertility Factor ', ' Behavioral ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2007,538953,0.029065296940230547

This award will allow me to accomplish these goals in the following way. I will: 1) enhance my statistical and epidemiological foundation; 2) develop skills in methodology, measurements, and analysis of epidemiological data; 3) develop the neccesary knowledge in preventive medicine, pharmacoepidemiology and bioinformatics necessary for implementing interventional studies based on the experience gained in my training and the )reliminary results of the proposed project. In obese African American (AA) subjects, we have proposed that ncreased GLP-1 levels [marker of enteroinsular axis activity (EIA) ] could promote adipogenesis and the :levelopment of comorbidities. It is still unclear whether these racial differences in EIA are determined by age, severity of overweight, differences in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) or autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulation. We will assess these three interrelated areas (EIA, CRF, and ANS modulation) in a bi- racial sample of wide-ranging overweight adolescents. In particular, we are interested in the relation between EIA activity and insulin dynamics as a potential mechanistic pathway to explain the increased prevalence of obesity, type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)in AA youth. ITherefore, we will determine the associations among EIA, CRF, glucose homeostasis, and risk factors for ICVD in adolescents. The results of this study can be translated into medical practice changes and may help to implement a more physiologically effective approach to obesity treatment in AA adolescents, in particular.

"Condom Use Among African American Females: Testing the Theory of Gender and Power    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research focuses on African American female adolescents and young adults, a population that is overrepresented in rates of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, in the United States. To understand why African American female adolescents and young women are vulnerable to HIV/STDs, contextual factors must be considered. The public health adaptation of the sociological theory of gender and power (TGP) provides a framework of social structural constructs that may be used to model contextual determinants of HIV/STD preventive behavior such as consistent condom use and it is one of the major underlying theoretical frameworks guiding the design of three evidence-based interventions for young women. The TGP describes three structures: the sexual division of labor, the structure of affective attachments and social norms, and the sexual division of power. These are hypothesized to generate acquired risks and individual risk factors for disease. This study seeks to test and validate a structural equation model of the direct and indirect effects of acquired social and relational risks and individual risk factors on consistent condom use among African American female adolescents and young women based on the TGP. The findings will address the NIMH Division of AIDS and Health and Behavior Research goal of HIV prevention research aimed at better-understanding the multiple levels of dyadic, social and structural factors that impact HIV risk. This study is a secondary analysis of data collected during AFIYA, a randomized controlled trial of an HIV prevention maintenance intervention for young African American women, currently funded by NIMH. Behavioral data derived in part from the TGP is being collected from 800 African American young women, ages 15-20. Multiple associations between selected theoretical constructs will be tested using structural equation modeling with the baseline data. The sample will be randomly split into two datasets; one dataset will serve to develop the model and the other dataset will be used to validate the model.       Public Health Relevance: An objective of Healthy People 2010 is to increase the proportion of adolescents who abstain from sexual intercourse or use condoms if currently sexually active. To better understand sexual behavior among African American female adolescents and young women it is crucial to account for social and relational influences. An empirical test of how the social structural theory of gender and power predicts condom use can provide insight into how to measure and model the associations among the constructs, extending the utility of a theory that has been used extensively to guide the design of HIV prevention interventions.           ",Condom Use Among African American Females: Testing the Theory of Gender and Power,7419488,F31MH082635,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' physical abuse ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Health behavior ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' insight ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Employment Status ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Maintenance ', ' Americas ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Religious Belief ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' self esteem ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Social Welfare ', ' welfare ', ' Knowledge ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Behavior ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Equation ', ' age group ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Prevention Research ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' emotional abuse ', ' mental abuse ', ' Psychological abuse ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' social attachment ', ' social bonding ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' abstracting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Accounting ', ' Communication ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Affective ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2007,26532,0.046160665280590124
"Bronx Youth as Partners in Community Participatory Research on Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This 3-year project uses community-based participatory action research to address health disparities among African American and Latino youth in the Bronx, NY, who are the defined ""community"" for this project.  We will design, implement and conduct a process evaluation of an intervention to reduce one health disparity selected by this community.  Adolescents are the lead decision-makers; there are two levels of partnership: The Project Planning Group (PPG) and The Bronx Coalition for Adolescent Health (Coalition) Both will be full participants in each phase of the work. The PPG includes: 14 Bronx teenagers age 14-19 that represent the larger community of Bronx teens; 2 researchers with scientific expertise; 2 program specialists with expertise on developing/implementing interventions; and 3 physicians who will provide health information.  The Coalition includes organizations having broad experience serving youth or specific expertise in a health disparity and will provide advice, and political and practical support. Specific Aim 1, building a partnership, will be accomplished through recommended strategies (e.g., having someone responsible for nurturing the partnership itself, shared responsibility for developing rules and processes, equity in decision making).  Specific Aim 2, conducting a needs assessment, includes analyses of national and local data; in-depth community interviews with stakeholders; a ""Windshield Tour"" to identify community factors; and data on relevant Bronx programs.  Specific Aim 3, selecting a health disparity, will be guided by Friere's structured dialogue model of listening-dialogue-action. Consensus methods will be used to select one disparity.  Friere's action phase will be implemented in Specific Aim 4, developing the intervention. We will develop the program using techniques used in our adolescent intervention trials. The PPG/Coalition will identify goals with the PPG staff will provide technical assistance. Specific Aim 5, piloting/conducting a process evaluation, will identify problems in recruitment, retention, receptivity, etc.  Specific Aim 6, evaluating the partnership, will assess the success of the partnership on leadership/management, the collaborative process, efficiency, synergy, empowerment, and satisfaction using the Partnership Self-Assessment Tool along with qualitative interviews.  This process will lead to a testable community-based intervention that has grown from the community's own experience and expertise, informed by epidemiologic data, program expertise and theory.         ",Bronx Youth as Partners in Community Participatory Research on Health Disparities,7247135,R24MD001784,"['Communication ', ' Communities ', ' feeding ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Conceptions ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demography ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Action Research ', ' Responsible Person ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Preventive ', ' TimeLine ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Program Reviews ', ' Range ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' catalyst ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Israel ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Policy Maker ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' New York ', ' Parents ', ' Physicians ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Self Assessment (Psychology) ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' day ', ' Techniques ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Budgets ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Academy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' ']",NIMHD,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R24,2007,582605,0.06254216303539763
"Symptom Severity, Treatment Engagement, and Outcomes for Culturally Diverse Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this research proposal is to investigate the patterns and roles of symptom severity and service engagement in community-based mental health services for diverse adolescent populations. Researchers and policy-makers have highlighted the need for a better understanding of the various factors contributing to issues related to mental health service utilization, engagement, and outcomes for ethnic minorities. Unfortunately, empirical research regarding these factors remains sparse. This research proposal addresses gaps in the literature by: 1) Examining the relationship between race/ethnicity and acculturation to symptom severity at treatment entry for a diverse adolescent sample, 2) Examining the relationship between symptom severity and treatment outcomes for a diverse adolescent sample, and 3)   Examining the role of treatment engagement in treatment outcomes for a diverse adolescent sample. The sample will consist of 260 adolescents (aged 12-19) who have received school and clinic-based mental health services, their parents, and their therapists. Secondary data analysis will be based on data collection from a baseline interview and four follow-up interviews over the course of 12 months. Research instruments measure symptom severity, engagement in treatment, sociodemographics, and treatment outcomes. Analysis will involve descriptive statistics, multiple regression models, and moderation and mediation effects on these models/equations.   Findings from this research proposal have potentially significant implications for improving the delivery and quality of care for ethnic minority adolescents.

"Analysis of neighborhood, school, & indiv level factors on adolescent obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood/adolescent obesity is an epidemic in the United States that disproportionately affects underserved populations. My long-term goal is to examine and address the social determinants that contribute to the exponential rise in obesity in children/adolescents and the current socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in obesity. The aim of my research is to illustrate how social, political, and economic factors such as concentration of poverty shape the food environment of youth. Based on existing research and social epidemiologic theories, viable solutions to the obesity epidemic are entrenched with a) focusing early in the life course on children/adolescents in order to reduce the likelihood of obesity in adulthood and prevent the development of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease and b) examining and ameliorating the social and environmental factors that cause obesity and obesity disparities. In the proposed study, I explore how characteristics of the neighborhood where young people live and where they go to school influence their likelihood of being overweight/obese above and beyond their individual characteristics. In order to achieve these objectives, I am employing a longitudinal research design using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. In the proposed study, I will examine individual, contextual, and social factors that may shape the food environment and therefore affect risk of obesity in adolescents. The research will analyze the effect of environmental factors such as, percent poverty and percent unemployed in census tract and racial composition of schools, on obesity after controlling for covariates such as maternal education, maternal overweight/obese, age, gender, and race/ethnicity. This multilevel inspired study design enables examination of both individual and contextual/compositional variables. The mission of the NIH is to promote scientific research that advances our knowledge and reduces the burden of illness and disability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In light of the growing prevalence of overweight/obesity and its devastating health and social consequences, my proposed study embodies the aims of the NIH by using innovative research strategies to conduct socially responsible research that will improve our understanding of overweight/obesity and help identify effective preventive solutions.             ","Analysis of neighborhood, school, & indiv level factors on adolescent obesity",7488072,F31HD056593,"['Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Statistically Significant ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Food ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Poverty ', ' Attenuated ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Solutions ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight ', ' Writing ', ' Height ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Censuses ', ' Gender ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' obesity risk ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Chronic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' ']",NICHD,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2008,28449,-0.012989844720457519
"Reducing Behavioral Health Disparities for Black Youth Phase II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antisocial behavior and violence are a national crisis disproportionately affecting Black youth (Cicchetti & Lynch, 1993; Prothrow-Stith & Spivak,1992). A vast health disparity exists in which Black youth are significantly more likely to both be identified as exhibiting antisocial behavior and to be the victim of others' antisocial acts. For example, victimization rates for violent crimes are greater than 750% higher for Black adolescents compared to White adolescents (Centers for Disease Control, 2004; Rachuba, Stanton, & Howard, 1995). The lack of culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions for Black youth exacerbates the problem and hinders access to mental health services among Blacks (Mandersheid & Sonnenschen, 1996). The goal of this Phase II project is to continue the research and development (R&D) of a child small group social-behavioral intervention curriculum, Celebrating the Strengths of Black Youth (CSBY), specifically designed to be culturally relevant and effective for Black youth. This Phase II project will build on Phase I findings to offer an innovative, much needed resource for preventing and decreasing existing behavioral health disparities in Black children (ages six to eight years old). CSBY will offer multi-media resources, including videos and interactive computer resources, and a skill-based curriculum specifically aimed at enhancing social and behavioral competencies. CSBY not only offers mental health (MH) professionals a significant advancement over what is currently available for use with Black youth, but it also provides a unique means of bridging intervention settings with home efforts to promote cross-environment generalization in social and behavioral functioning. During Phase II, the complete CSBY product will be developed, revised, and extended through a series of Alpha and Beta tests. During the course of product development, the 3-C development team will draw on the Advisory Council forthis project, as well as relevant3-C Scientific Advisory Board members to review product materials, provide feedback, and aid development through resources and contacts, as needed. The planned iterative development and feedback by diverse stakeholders will produce a product that will be widely applicable, usable, and acceptable, thereby increasing its commercial potential. Once completed, the CSBY Beta prototype will be scientifically evaluated. In addition to program engagement and product evaluation measures, the efficacy of CSBY for enhancing children's social and behavioral functioning will be empirically tested through randomized trials within both school- and community-based settings. It is expected that Black youth participating in CSBY will be more engaged in treatment and show greater improvement on social- behavioral indices compared to Black youth participating in an established generally-applicable social skills program (i.e., S.S.GRIN; DeRosier, 2006). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antisocial behavior and violence among youth has become a national health crisis for which Black youth are disproportionately at risk (Cicchetti & Lynch, 1993; Prothrow-Stith & Spivak,1992). However, existing research on the effectiveness of specific strategies to reduce and prevent youth violence remains challenged by increasing diversity and the need to provide services that are both developmentally and culturally appropriate. The proposed product is consistent with what has been identified by several legislative mandates as necessary in addressing the challenges of providing health care to differing ethnicities and fostering the development of cultural competence in service providers. The proposed product is also consistent with priorities identified by NICHD to help reduce or eliminate health disparities among racial and ethnic minority populations (NICHD, 2000) as well as recommendations by the Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health (U.S. DHHS, 2001) for ""tailoring services to meet the needs of all Americans, including racial and ethnic minorities"".             ",Reducing Behavioral Health Disparities for Black Youth Phase II,7481857,R44HD049938,"['Crime ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Preparation ', ' Rate ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' discount ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' indexing ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Fostering ', ' satisfaction ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Respondent ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Letters ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Condition ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sales ', ' Schools ', ' Socialization ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Attitude ', ' Writing ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Test Result ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' skills training ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' small social group ', ' Books ', ' resource guides ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' anti social ', ' antisocial ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Certification ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Training Technics ', ' Training Technique ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Mental Health Services ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' youth violence ', ' teen violence ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 8 year old ', ' eight year old ', ' age 8 years ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' treatment effect ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' Computers ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NICHD,3-C INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT,R44,2008,363923,0.024983209238213504

"""Development and Crash Injury Risk in Adolescent Latino Males""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unintentional injury remains the leading cause of death in children over age one. This is no different for children entering and traversing the adolescent period of life (age 10 - age 18). While adolescence has been described as a development period of strength and resilience, experts have highlighted the dual paradox that exists during this time of life. This dual paradox describes adolescence as a time of increased injury-related morbidity and mortality rates despite it also being a time of acquiring greater physical strength and capacity for decision-making. Because of their higher than expected mortality rate as they navigate the adolescent and emerging adult period of life, Latino adolescent males have been identified as the anomaly to the Latino Epidemiological Paradox. Cause of death during this time is largely attributed to motor vehicle crashes. The research proposed in this application will explore adolescent developmental sources of crash risk in the context of Latino and youth culture. The first component of this research program will involve analysis of data sets from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. It will provide longitudinal information on adolescent friend influence on risky driving behavior in the general population. The second component will involve comprehensive in-depth interviews of Latino adolescent males in order gain greater insight into Latino and youth culture and risky driving behavior. The last research component will utilize survey and diaries methodologies to elucidate the social context of risky driving in Latino adolescents and how this changes over the adolescent and emerging adult periods of life.  Successfully completing this training and research, the applicant will acquire a skill set needed to become an independent clinical investigator. Furthermore, the information gained will lead to broader understanding of injury disparity in Latino adolescent males and be applied to future development of a clinical contact injury prevention intervention.         ","""Development and Crash Injury Risk in Adolescent Latino Males""",7500760,K23HD050630,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' concept ', ' Health ', ' Depth ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Investigation ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' skills ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Friends ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Latino ', ' driving behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' injured ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K23,2008,124217,0.05304398261450578
"Hispanic Stress Inventory Adolescent Immigrant and Non-Immigrant (HSI-A I/NI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic adolescents are at elevated risk for mental health and related behavioral problems. Culturally specific stress is associated with the risk for these problems. The objective of the proposed research is to develop a stress assessment inventory for Hispanic adolescents. This Phase II study builds upon the results of the Phase I feasibility study. The study will further validate and norm immigrant and non-immigrant versions of the Hispanic Stress Inventory-Adolescent (HSI- A.). A cross-sectional research design with a nested test-retest component and multisite, multimeasure features will be applied. A stratified sample of middle and high school students (N=1600) and clinical sample of adolescents with a diagnosed behavioral health problem will be selected (N=400) in 4 research sites representing the diversity of the United States Hispanic population: LosAngeles, Miami, Dallas and Boston. The 160 items developed in the Phase I study will be self administered to the adolescents along with the criterion measures and analysis will determine the standardized version of the HSI-A. The six objectives of this study of Hispanic early (13-15 years) and late adolescents (15-17 years) are: 1) To determine, through a series of exploratory factor analyses, the global construct validity and factor structures of the HSI-A immigrant and non- immigrant versions; 2) Estimate the construct validity of the final HSI-A by analyzing the similarities and differences in scale and subscale scores between the student sample and the clinically defined contrast group; 3) Assess the HSI-A for criterion-related validity using concurrent measures; 4) Assess the reliability of the HSI-A through the use of internal consistency, split-half and test-retest procedures; 5) Using survey data from a national sample of Hispanic adolescents, generate national normative data and actuarial profiles of the HSI-A; 6)Assess the reliability of the HSI-Athat includes web-based administration and scoring features as an integral part of the commercialization plan. The HSI-A will be marketed through a commercialization plan and will provide a screening tool for early detection of elevated stress and the prevention of the onset of mental health disorders by mental health professionals. The President's New Freedom Commission has recommended that the screening and early detection of mental disorders and the reduction of health disparities be priorities in the transformation of the nation's mental health system. The proposed research will address these two national public mental health needs through the development and commercialization of the Hispanic Stress Inventory - Adolescent. This new clinical screening tool will significantly increase the capacity of mental health professionals to prevent and reduce the risk in the vulnerable and rapidly growing population of Hispanic adolescents of serious mental health and behavioral problems through effective assessment of abnormal levels of stress.          ",Hispanic Stress Inventory Adolescent Immigrant and Non-Immigrant (HSI-A I/NI),7495117,R44MH073180,"['Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Provider ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Small Business Funding Mechanisms ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Justice ', ' Language ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Immigrant ', ' Phase II Clinical Trials ', ' phase II trial ', ' phase II protocol ', ' phase 2 trial ', ' Phase 2 Clinical Trials ', ' Nurses ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Physicians ', ' tool ', ' Psychologist ', ' instrument ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' English Language ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Event ', ' Score ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Services ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' high school ', ' Boston ', ' Structure ', ' prevention service ', ' technological innovation ', ' Prevention ', ' probation ', ' Reporting ', ' CD-ROM ', ' Compact Disk Read-Only Memory ', ' CDROM ', ' CD-ROM (Compact Disc-Read Only Memory) ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Businesses ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Climacteric ', ' life change ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' phase I trial ', ' phase I protocol ', ' phase 1 trial ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' commercial application ', ' commercialization ', ' ']",NIMH,"BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT, INC.",R44,2008,486313,0.01798204176636707
"DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A JAMAICAN MOTHER-DAUGHTER HIV RISK-REDUCTION PROGRAM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Caribbean nations, including Jamaica, exhibit HIV rates that are second only to sub-Saharan Africa. Jamaican young women and adolescent girls are at particularly high risk due to a number of cultural factors, gender norms, partnering with older male partners, and lack of knowledge and skills related to sexual refusal and HIV prevention. U.S. studies have shown that mothers may act as a key influence of their daughters' sexual risk beliefs and behaviors. However, no studies have documented these effects outside of the U.S. and no studies have evaluated HIV risk-reduction interventions with Jamaican adolescent girls and their mothers. Hence, the purpose of the proposed project is to partner with the University of the West Indies, Jamaican community based organizations (CBOs) and families in order to develop and test a culture-specific mother-daughter HIV risk-reduction intervention in a randomized pilot field experiment. Specifically, we propose to test whether a culture-specific, theory-based, skill-building intervention with Jamaican adolescent girls and their mothers can directly and/or indirectly reduce these girls' HIV risk-associated sexual behaviors. Jamaican girls, ages 14-18, and their mothers/female guardians will be recruited from CBOs and randomly assigned to either: (a) a mother-daughter HIV risk-reduction intervention condition or (b) a ""no intervention"" control condition. The HIV risk-reduction intervention includes 8 modules scheduled over 2 days and implemented by trained adult Jamaican women recruited from among CBO staff. The mother component is designed to increase parenting behaviors (e.g., parental monitoring, parent-child sexual communication [PCSC]) associated with reduced adolescent sexual risk-taking; the teen component is designed to improve girls' beliefs and skills related to abstinence, sexual negotiation and condom use. A ""no intervention"" control condition is being employed as the proposed project is a pilot study of the HIV risk-reduction intervention. Primary outcomes include mothers'/daughters' reports of parenting behaviors and daughters' self-reports of sexual risk behaviors (sexual intercourse, unprotected sex, condom use, number of partners). Secondary outcomes include mothers' beliefs regarding parenting behaviors and daughters beliefs regarding sexual risk behaviors-the theoretical mediators of intervention effects. Findings from this study will contribute to the development of effective HIV risk-reduction programs for Jamaican adolescent girls and young women.             ",DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A JAMAICAN MOTHER-DAUGHTER HIV RISK-REDUCTION PROGRAM,7504033,R01NR010478,"['Daughter ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' Caribbean natives ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' International ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Rate ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Depth ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Incidence ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Jamaica ', ' Numbers ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Parents ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Planning Theory ', ' instrument ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Nursing Schools ', ' Nurse Training Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Abstinence ', ' sex abstinence ', ' not sexually active ', ' celibate ', ' abstaining from sex ', ' abstain from sexual intercouse ', ' abstain from sexual activity ', ' abstain from intercouse ', ' Celibacy ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' West Indies ', ' Caribbean Islands ', ' Woman ', ' Wood material ', ' Wood ', ' Work ', ' day ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' interest ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' intervention program ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' parental monitoring ', ' parent monitoring ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Schedule ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' community organizations ', ' safer sex ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NINR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,439135,0.03319733899408491

"Biopsychosocial Determinants of Adolescent Obesity/Cardiovascular Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of adolescent obesity is high in the U.S., and in Latin America. While dramatic environmental changes in the food and physical environment are associated with increased risk, there continues to be inadequate understanding of the individual, family and community level factors that protect against the development of obesity. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms leading to disparate risk for obesity in low-income and Hispanic/Latino youth. The proposed 5-year project aims to elucidate interconnected biological and social pathways associated with adolescent obesity and risk for later development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This application involves approximately 620 Chilean adolescents, assessed in infancy, 3 to 5 years and 10 years as part of a NIH-supported cohort study of the behavioral and developmental effects of preventing iron deficiency anemia in infancy (n = 1645). As such, detailed longitudinal data related to growth, health and development have been collected. At 16 to 17 years, the youth will participate in study of activity, sleep and eating patterns using actigraphic recording and laboratory assessment of eating behavior. In addition, we will measure anthropometry, fat and muscle mass (DXA), fasting glucose, insulin (HOMA IR), lipids, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, orexin, CRP, and TNF alpha. Detailed information about family history, smoking, health, and psychosocial functioning will also be collected. Neighborhood level factors such as crime, walk ability and resources for physical activity and healthful food attributes will be assessed. Furthermore, a sizeable subset (n = 237) with sleep neurophysiology and actigraphic recordings at multiple time points will participate in 2-night polysmnographic sleep study at 16 years.    Guided by a life-course approach, we propose to investigate three Specific Aims:    Specific Aim 1 - To evaluate biological and psychosocial determinants of obesity and related metabolic disturbance in a cohort of adolescents followed since early infancy.    Specific Aim 2  - To assess associations between obesity/adiposity and biomarkers of adiposity-related metabolic disturbance in this sample of Chilean adolescents.    Specific Aim 3 - To assess the role of circadian patterns of physical activity, sleep and eating behavior on adiposity and related metabolic disturbance.    The long standing collaboration between the Institute for Nutrition and Technology at the University of Chile and the Center for Human Growth and Development at the University of Michigan provides an outstanding environment to study biological and psychosocial determinants of adolescent obesity in a low- to middle-income cohort of Latin American youth who are very similar in obesity risk to comparable U.S. youth. We expect to advance understanding of how developmental patterns of eating and activity are influenced by early life factors and in turn influence the development of obesity and related metabolic disturbance. Our study is unique in the depth and breadth of longitudinal psychosocial and biological data. We propose research that crosses disciplinary boundaries and has the potential to reveal important determinants of adolescent obesity for future intervention research. PUBLIC HEATLH RELEVANCE: Adolescent obesity develops during childhood in response to biological factors and social conditions. While biological factors such as genetic inheritance are difficult to change, social factors could be targets for preventive efforts. We expect to further understanding of the environmental and social conditions related to the development of obesity in a high risk urban, Hispanic/Latino population. We are interested in how children develop circadian rhythms related to eating, sleeping and activity, and subsequently how these patterns lead to obesity.

"Parent Intervention in CBT for Depressed Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite progress in treating mental disorders in youth, little is known about these interventions with Latinos who are now the largest minority group in the United States. This study examines the impact of enhancing effective interventions through the involvement of parents in an 8 session of a psycho education intervention (PPI). This PPI will be incorporated into the 12-session CBT, a Cognitive Behavioral treatment method that has already been shown effective for the treatment of adolescent depression. This study will randomize 140 Latino adolescents with Major Depression to CBT with or without a PPI delivered in groups. Intake diagnoses will be obtained via structured diagnostic interviews (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-DISC for adolescents and Composite International Diagnostic Interview-CIDI for parents). The study will focus on Puerto Rican adolescents and their parents. The primary aims address both the efficacy and effectiveness of the intervention and treatments. Efficacy questions focus on the comparison of the active treatment with and without the PPI for reducing depressive symptoms and diagnosis (DISC) after 12 weeks of treatment and for preventing relapse over the course of one year post-treatment (DISC). Effectiveness questions focus on the impact of the treatment with or without the PPI on broader functional outcomes. Patient functional outcomes include general functioning status, family functioning, school attendance, and attrition rates. The relative value of CBT with and without the adjunctive parent intervention for improved parent functioning regarding psychiatric distress and symptoms, burden of patient illness, and work attendance will be examined. We hypothesize that the active treatment with PPI will be superior to no PPI in reducing depression at post treatment. Because the PPI is designed to involve parents and thus impact other aspects of the family system, this treatment is expected to produce better outcomes in several of the functional domains. To test the theoretical assumptions of the intervention, we also aim to examine the contribution of hypothesized treatment-specific change mechanisms to mediate the short-term outcome and predict long-term relapse over one year. This study responds to NIH and NIMH initiatives on decreasing disparities in health and mental health care between minorities and White populations and will contribute to our knowledge base.         ",Parent Intervention in CBT for Depressed Latino Youth,7426774,R01MH067893,"['Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Intake ', ' International ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Affect ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Psychiatric Hospitals ', ' mental health facility ', ' Mental Institutions ', ' Mental Hospitals ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Interview ', ' Distress ', ' Numbers ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Week ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' social ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' relapse prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' psychoeducation ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' 14 year old ', ' fourteen year old ', ' age 14 years ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO RIO PIEDRAS,R01,2008,334691,0.01208948216580988
"Enacted Stigma, Gender & Risk Behaviors of School Youth Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and questioning (GLBQ) youth are at increased risk for health disparities, including HIV and teen pregnancy, vs. heterosexual peers, a risk attributed to the effects of nearly universal stigma for sexual minorities. Behaviors in a social group that convey or enforce stigma are enacted stigma; culture influences stigma, yet gender and ethnic variations in enacted stigma have seldom been examined among youth. Enacted stigma in school has been measured only indirectly in large-scale school-based surveys. To develop effective interventions, we need to understand enacted stigma among different cultural groups, develop culturally competent, reliable measures, and test the links between stigma and health behaviors in population-based surveys. Although GLBQ stigma is our primary focus, understanding how other types of stigma are enacted is important in developing general measures of enacted stigma.  Therefore, the purpose of this 5-year, mixed-methods international study is to explore enacted stigma behaviors among indigenous, Asian-ancestry, and European-ancestry adolescents in school environments in Canada, New Zea- land, and the US, to develop cross-cultural measures of enacted stigma for adolescent health surveys, and to examine the association of types of stigma and HIV risk behaviors among adolescents. The specific aims are:  I. To compare the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors associated with sexual orientation and other stigmatized identi- ties among youth in existing large-scale school-based surveys, and to identify both the existing indirect measures of stigma that are risk factors plus the protective factors significantly associated with the HIV risk behaviors.  II. To identify the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors and associated risk and protective factors among indigenous adolescents--American Indian (US), First Nations (Canada), Maori (New Zealand--as well as youth of Asian ancestry in each country, and to compare the patterns among adolescents of similar ethnic backgrounds in the 3 countries.  III. To explore among adolescent and adult key informants the ways stigma is understood, assigned, and enforced in the school environment, and to compare the patterns within the three countries. This exploration will be focused pri- marily on stigma based on sexual orientation status, but other types of stigmatized identities will be examined to under-  stand the similarities and differences of how stigma is enacted, and the potential utility of generic stigma measures.  IV. Within each country, to elicit explanatory models from adolescents and youth workers on the survey findings of HIV risk behaviors and stigma, and to tap suggested strategies for reducing stigma and addressing sexual risk behaviors  in culturally appropriate ways among GLBQ youth.  V. Incorporating the findings of aims I-IV, to develop, pilot, and psychometrically evaluate universal and country-  specific culturally competent items and scales, for population-based adolescent health surveys, that measure perceived  and enacted stigma in school, to allow cross-cul_ral comparisons of the effects of stigma among adolescents.

"HIV Prevention and Partner Abuse: Developing an Intervention for Adolescent Girls    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This K01 Career Development Award proposes to establish a rigorous academic foundation for a research career devoted to developing and testing novel interventions for reducing HIV risk for adolescents. Thematically, the K01 will address the social context of HIV risk by integrating effective theory-based adolescent HIV prevention with promising partner abuse prevention strategies, emphasizing promotion of healthy relationships. It uses family planning clinics as a venue for providing a skill-based, culturally-tailored HIV and partner abuse prevention educational and advocacy program for African American girls living is economically disadvantaged circumstances. Partner abuse, which significantly increases risk for HIV, disproportionately affects low income African-American adolescent girls, as does HIV. Critical to this project is the candidate's demonstrated ability to conduct HIV/STD research in partnership with minority communities, a long term engagement in interdisciplinary scholarship aimed at improving health and a 20- year history as a primary care provider. However, to meet her long term career objective she requires additional instruction and mentorship in 6 key areas: 1) Methods for developing theory-driven, culture- specific, developmental^ appropriate curricula in HIV prevention intervention; 2) Design and evaluation of RCT prevention programs with specific considerations for reducing HIV risk associated with partner violence among adolescent girls; 3) Advanced skills in statistical analysis, particularly techniques relevant to intervention research; 4) Study in HIV and intimate partner violence among adolescents, with special attention to racial, economic and gender disparities; 5) Responsible conduct of research with particular attention to legal and ethical considerations for adolescent HIV and partner abuse issues; 6) Manuscript preparation skills. The research plan is divided into two phases, both guided by social cognitive and gender theory. In phase 1 we will conduct focus groups and individual interviews in order to develop and tailor the HIV/partner abuse intervention for adolescent girls and in phase 2 we will evaluate the initial acceptability and feasibility of this intervention in a limited RCT. Over the 5 years of the award, instruction, training, mentorship, and applied experiences are expected to significantly enhance the candidate's skills and expertise as a researcher and also contribute greatly to launching an independent research program.           ",HIV Prevention and Partner Abuse: Developing an Intervention for Adolescent Girls,7422438,K01MH080649,"['Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Instruction ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' Teen Dating Violence ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' relationship abuse ', ' abusive relationship ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Provider ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Legal ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Advocacy ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cognitive ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Preparation ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Family ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' physical abuse ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' partner violence ', ' violent partner ', ' problem, partner, abuse, violent ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Measurement ', ' male ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Anger ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' tool ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Scholarship ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Societies ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Partner Abuse ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Manuscripts ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Emotional ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' girls ', ' Family Planning ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2008,152454,0.08802253057278661
"Community Violence Exposure and Positive Youth Development in Urban Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescents in urban environments are exposed to staggering proportions of community violence which affects their physical and emotional well-being. Consequences of community violence exposure include depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress and aggression, and likely add to health disparities. Research shows that posttraumatic stress may mediate the relationship between community violence exposure and negative mental health outcomes. Posttraumatic stress responses can be considered both normative and pathological, and this duality makes the potential role of posttraumatic stress as a mediator between community violence exposure and outcomes intriguing. If young people are the future of society, exposure to community violence and its ramifications is unacceptable and demands innovative solutions. This proposed study will focus on positive youth development in the context of community violence. The positive youth development perspective can help to inform the design of future interventions that enhance the development of potentially vulnerable and often marginalized youth. Positive youth development expands knowledge beyond the absence of problem behaviors or pathology, to the presence of healthy development.      The goal of this training plan is to gain a better understanding of the relationship between community violence exposure, posttraumatic stress and positive youth development in urban adolescents. The purpose of this proposed study is to use a quantitative cross-sectional research design to specifically examine the effects of posttraumatic stress in the relationship between community violence exposure and positive youth development in 110 community-dwelling urban adolescents, ages 13-17. The specific aims of this study are to: 1). Describe the level of community violence exposure, posttraumatic stress, and indicators of positive youth development among urban adolescents: 2). Examine the relationships between community violence exposure, posttraumatic stress, and positive youth development: and 3.) Explore the combined effects of community violence exposure and posttraumatic stress on positive youth development.      This proposal addresses community violence exposure, a known public health problem for urban youth. Research conducted through this fellowship will include collection of data from community-dwelling adolescents in order to gain an understanding of the impact of community violence exposure on positive youth development in urban adolescents. Results of this study not only can contribute to public health, but also address NINR's mission and strategic goals by elucidating mechanisms underlying health disparities in urban adolescents.          ",Community Violence Exposure and Positive Youth Development in Urban Adolescents,7611335,F31NR011107,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Purpose ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Empathy ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' improved ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Homicide ', ' Chronic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Training ', ' Literature ', ' Fostering ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Mission ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Pathology ', ' Exposure to ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Solutions ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Arousal ', ' Stress ', ' Well in self ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Mental well-being ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Event ', ' Reporting ', ' Cause of Death ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Competence ', ' Mediating ', ' response ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' 1 year old ', ' one year old ', ' age 1 year ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2008,40934,0.04599317646336961
"Adolescent Violence Exposure and Internalizing and Externalizing Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a training grant for which the main goal is to increase the research proficiency of the applicant, and prepare her to become an independent researcher with expertise in the areas of community violence exposure and African American mental health. Training and scholarship in these areas is important because African American youth are more likely to witness and be victims of community violence exposure, possibly due to the overrepresentation of African Americans in low income neighborhoods. The intensity and severity of the violent events that occur in poorer neighborhoods affects youth in these areas at disproportionate rates and places African American adolescents at a greater risk for many of the negative effects associated with violence exposure, including academic, social, and psychological difficulties. The specific aims for the proposed research are: 1) to expand my knowledge of the development of ethnic minority urban adolescents, with a focus on youth internalizing and externalizing outcomes associated with chronic experiences with violence; 2) to examine factors associated with resilience for youth exposed to violence, and 3) to expand my knowledge of and proficiency with statistical methods and research designs appropriate for studying the effects of violence exposure and perceived neighborhood violence on adolescent mental health. This proposal is for secondary analysis of an existing dataset comprised of an epidemiologically-defined community sample of 585 African American adolescents (53.2% male), who were first assessed during first grade, collected for 5R01MH057005-09, ""Periodic Follow Up of Two Preventative Trials"" (P.I.: Nicholas lalongo). Participants were assessed at regular intervals from elementary school through adolescence resulting in varying sample sizes (Table 1).

"Determinants and disparities in high-risk sexual behaviors in US adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preventing youths' high-risk sexual behaviors represent some of the most difficult and important challenges for social and behavioral scientists. This study will identify factors contributing to youths' high-risk sexual behaviors and their disparities. The objectives involve testing a causal model of sexual behaviors guided by the theory of triadic influence (TTI; Flay & Petraitis, 1994), a model well-tested in predicting other adolescent risk behaviors that specifies the operation of key proximal factors as well as more distal factors. Consistent with TTI, proximal factors will include self-efficacy, attitudes, and social norms; distal factors include global positive expectancies, depressive symptoms, parental relatedness, and academic orientation. Finally, potentially vital socio-cultural influences will be tested as ultimate (most distal) factors in the model. Global expectancies and cultural orientation in Latinos are two important factors of emphasis in the model that are understudied within comprehensive models of adolescents' sexual behaviors. The objectives will be accomplished through secondary analyses of Add Health data (National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health) collected from 1994-2002. These data (N = 20,745 at Wave I; N = 14,738 at Wave II; N = 15,197 at Wave III) afford very strong tests of the model from mid-adolescence through young adulthood. These data include reports from friends, partners and parents, and also have substantial proportions of Latino youth (including substantial Mexican Americans, but also over samples of Cuban American and Puerto Rican youth) and African Americans. Behavioral outcomes of focus at both follow-ups include reported early intercourse, unprotected sexual intercourse, and number of sexual partners. Additionally, reported unintended pregnancies, reported STDs, and positive tests on STD assays at Wave III will be included both to validate the behavioral reports and to provide further testing of the model's predictive efficacy. Cutting edge analysis techniques appropriate for longitudinal data such as structural equation, survival, and multi-level modeling will be employed to achieve the study objectives. By clarifying the causal paths leading to these behaviors and identifying which specific protective or risk factors are most critical for adolescent groups where disparities are apparent, the proposed project may aid in the development of more effective sexual-risk reduction programs designed for diverse adolescent populations. Adolescent sexual risk taking behaviors are major causes of premature death and disability in the US as well as lead to unplanned pregnancies. Despite evidence suggesting differing patterns of sexual behaviors between and within ethnic groups, the role of socio-cultural factors within comprehensive theory-guided models of the determinants of high-risk sexual behaviors have been relatively untested. By clarifying such factors like cultural orientation within such a theoretical model, this study will assist preventive programs in their efforts to address the most critical sexual risk taking deterrence factors for diverse adolescent groups.          ",Determinants and disparities in high-risk sexual behaviors in US adolescents,7387657,R03HD053590,"['Cuban American ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Distal ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Sexual Development ', ' sex development ', ' Numbers ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Parents ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Social Class ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' Attitude ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Equation ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Communities ', ' birth control ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' Population ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R03,2008,74563,0.07030699568014026
"Prime Time: Health Promotion for Multiple Risk Behaviors Prime Time: Health Promotion for Multiple Risk Behaviors is a five-year intervention research study (2005- 2009) with an overall goal to design, implement and evaluate a multi-component intervention among adolescent girls at high risk for early pregnancy that reduces multiple precursors of teen pregnancy including sexual risk taking, violence involvement, and school disconnection. Prime Time targets 13-17 year old girls (n=250) attending school and community clinics in Minneapolis/St Paul who meet specified risk criteria. Using an experimental design, half of study participants are randomly assigned to the intervention condition; half are assigned to the control condition. Intervention participants will be involved with the Prime Time intervention for an 18-month period, while control participants will continue to receive usual clinic services. Self-report data will be collected (via A-CASI surveys) from all study participants at study baseline and at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months following study enrollment. To address core risk and protective factors related to sexual risk behaviors, violence involvement, and school disconnection, the Prime Time intervention employs an innovative combination of previously-tested approaches including one-on-one case management, peer education (Just In Time) and service learning (It's Our Time) experiences. This multi-component intervention was developed and field-tested in the Prime Time pilot study. Using multi-wave data, we evaluate intervention impacts on participants' sexual risk taking and contraceptive behaviors; school connectedness, school misbehavior and school performance; violence involvement and peer-related aggression. We also test the extent to which intervention effects on outcome behaviors are mediated by hypothesized risk and protective factors targeted for change by the Prime Time intervention. If the intervention demonstrates success in preventing risk behaviors, we will actively engage in dissemination efforts to affect best practices in primary care clinics serving adolescent girls.

"ADHD: Detection and Service Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a chronic, often lifelong, psychiatric disorder with onset in early childhood. ADHD treatment disparities for affected African-American youth and for girls have been consistently documented, but the contributing factors in the help-seeking process are poorly understood.  The Institute of Medicine, in its recent recommendations on improving quality of care, stresses the importance of ensuring that patient values guide clinical interventions.  This competing renewal seeks to follow a cohort of youth into their adolescent years and to conduct a parallel quantitative and qualitative study to achieve the following three objectives:  1) To test three sets of hypotheses addressing predictors of continuities or discontinuities of ADHD treatment status from childhood to adolescence, and relevant adolescent outcomes on multiple levels (symptoms, functioning, consumer perspectives, environments, and systems).  2) The qualitative study component seeks to describe elements and experiences that have helped or hindered help-seeking for ADHD for two underserved groups: girls and African-American youth with ADHD.  Special emphasis will be given to the interplay between ADHD knowledge, the social network consultation process, and values and treatment preferences, to identify interventions aimed at reducing treatment disparities that respect patient values.  3) Intervention options identified in the qualitative study, along with professional treatment guidelines, will be tested for acceptability, feasibility, and perceived benefit in a survey to the entire cohort and randomly selected health and education professionals.   To achieve Objective 1, a longitudinal observational study, collecting parent, youth and teacher data will be conducted among a high-risk cohort of youth that have already been followed over the past 4 years.  The first two study phases will focus on treatment continuity and discontinuity in adolescence, and the last phase on outcomes.  For this last phase, a matched group of low-risk youth will be recruited from the original screening cohort of our first study.  To achieve Objective 2, experience sampling method (ESM) with eight youth, their parents and teachers will be used to develop themes and questions for 10 focus groups (FG), four for parents, four for youths, and two for teachers.  Cohort participants will be sampled for ESM and FG based on criterion sampling (ADHD treatment status, gender, and race).  Feedback forums after each data collection phase will enhance validity and trustworthiness of findings.  A framework of critical theory will guide open coding, domain analysis, critical incident method and political analysis, which represent the qualitative data analysis methods used in this study.  In addition, the focus will be on perceived beneficial steps that could be taken to improve the help-seeking experience from the perspectives of the youth, parents, and teachers, culminating in a summary of suggested intervention options to improve equitable access to treatment.  For Objective 3, these intervention options, along with a summary of professional treatment guidelines for ADHD, will be presented to the entire study cohort, school district teachers, and medical treatment providers in the form of a survey for assessment of acceptability, feasibility, and perceived benefits.  Survey findings will be processed in feedback forums in preparation of pilot interventions.  The study occurs in partnership with the school district and an advisory board of school professionals, parents, and youth.  The research team has an extensive track record of success with similar study designs and will use innovative technologies to adhere to an efficient management plan.

"RESEARCH AND TRAINING ON CONTEXTUAL EFFECTS IMPACTING ADOLESCENT HEALTH    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 will allow the PI to establish an independent career in public health and to help her achieve her career goal to conduct research that explains a variety of health outcomes and disparities in outcomes, in terms of the role of modifiable factors in the local environmental context. The candidate is applying for the award to gain extensive training and experience in social and spatial epidemiology, including multilevel modeling, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and the built environment, analysis of complex survey design data, and adolescent health. The knowledge and experience obtained will be used to investigate the role of the physical and social macro-environments on adolescent behavior substance use, physical activity, and dietary habits. Despite the growth in empirical research on neighborhood environmental characteristics and their influence on adolescent health behaviors, much remains to be learned. Many researchers have not gone beyond the two-level conceptualizations of a multilevel model, yet it is reasonable to assume that adolescent health is influenced by numerous levels. Adolescents will be nested not only within their neighborhoods but also within their family or household unit providing a unique and rare opportunity to examine multiple levels of influence. Although there have been calls to modify environments to reduce negative health outcomes, most work has focused on the micro-environment (e.g., home, school influences). This study will use the unique opportunity of georeferenced national survey data on a racially diverse sample of adolescents included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Primary Aims are:1) to develop neighborhood-level measures that characterize physical and social neighborhood factors thought to influence adolescent health behavior; 2) to evaluate whether characteristics of the physical and social environment explain a substantial proportion of the variance in adolescent health behaviors; 3) to determine moderators of the association between the physical and social environment and adolescent health behavior; and 4) to identify racial and ethnic disparities in health behavior and to examine whether physical and characteristics of the neighborhood where an adolescent resides explains disparities. The skills gained during the proposed training will provide the candidate with the requisite training to become a strong independent investigator in neighborhood influences on health and specifically, adolescent health.           ",RESEARCH AND TRAINING ON CONTEXTUAL EFFECTS IMPACTING ADOLESCENT HEALTH,7497043,K01SH000002,[''],NCHS,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,K01,2008,146348,0.09184049337315198
"A longitudinal multi-level analysis of health disparities among adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healthy People 2010 includes objectives related both to adolescent health and to reducing health disparities. This R21 will examine health disparities over time in demographically defined sub-groups of youth by conducting secondary analyses of the 5 waves of longitudinal data from the Youth Asset Study (YAS). This study's purpose is to examine associations among youth assets, environmental factors, and adolescent risky behaviors across youth sub-groups over a 4 year period. Adolescent health disparities have been shown for race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). Tracking these objectives over time across youth sub-groups is important to assess health disparities and monitor progress of the Healthy People 2010 goals. It is also imperative to determine factors that may be related to these disparities including individual factors such as youth assets as well as environmental factors. We propose to use existing data from the YAS (funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (CDC) Division of Reproductive Health), a 4 year/5 wave longitudinal prospective study that involves youth aged 12-17 years at wave 1 and their parents The study examines associations among neighborhood and family factors, youth assets, and youth risk behaviors. The CDC has funded data collection and data analysis related to sexual risk behaviors. The CDC supports our submission for additional funding for analysis of other outcomes. Data collected includes: 17 assets (e.g. Relationship with Mother, Religiosity, Peer Role Models), youth race/ethnicity, extensive parent reported socioeconomic status (SES) data, and risky behaviors including non-use of seatbelts, riding with drivers who have been drinking alcohol, binge drinking of alcoholic beverages, tobacco use, physical fighting, and weapon carrying. The following specific hypotheses will be examined: 1) Disparities in the proportion of youth participating in risky behaviors will change over time and this change will be different for each race/ethnicity and impacted by SES. 2) The impact of youth assets in the disparate relationship between risky behavior and time will vary by race/ethnicity and SES. 3) Environmental factors (waves 1 & 2) and assets (wave 3) will be associated with risk behavior disparities (waves 4 & 5) differently across race/ethnic groups and impacted by SES. 4) Youth assets (wave 3) will moderate the influence of environmental factors (waves 1 & 2) on behavioral disparities differently across race/ethnic and SES groups. Separate analyses for each of the six risky behaviors will be conducted. To test these hypotheses multi-level longitudinal mixed effect models, marginal models, and structural equation modeling will be utilized. Health disparities related to racial/ethnic groups while controlling for SES will initially be examined by analyzing interactions and then may be further examined by stratifying the data based on race/ethnicity. This information will help explain the role of youth assets and the environment as they relate to youth health disparities for six risky behaviors specifically related to race/ethnicity and SES. Results will help guide interventions developed to eliminate youth health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study will contribute to public health in the general area of youth development theory and specifically to our understanding of how youth assets and environmental factors may decrease health disparities related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status across six risky behaviors in adolescents. Practitioners can use the study results to guide interventions specifically planned at reducing or eliminating youth health disparities related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.           Project narrative The study will contribute to public health in the general area of youth development theory and specifically to our understanding of how youth assets and environmental factors may decrease health disparities related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status across six risky behaviors in adolescents.

"School Environment as a Mechanism to Reduce Youth Violence and Victimization    Description (Provided by Applicant): Youth violence imposes enormous costs on individuals and society. Youth violence is the second leading cause of death among individuals ages 10 to 24. Each year, over 720,000 youth are treated in emergency rooms for violence-related injuries (CDC, 2008a). These harms are particularly acute among minority youth. Improving school environments may serve as an effective preventative intervention because they are environmental anchors for youth and are part of the larger set of structural features of local environments linked to the prevalence of youth violence. Given that most individuals initiate violent behaviors during school years, schools provide a natural nexus in considering how to promote pro-social change within individuals and consequently reduce the prevalence of violence. Outside of the family, schools represent the most important institution of social control. Youth attending poorly-managed and resource-deprived schools are more likely to be exposed to violence, even after accounting for local community and family-related attributes. The concentration of youth on/around school grounds during the most crime prone times of the day, suggests that schools are natural ecological environments from which violence can generate. The proposed study will expand our understanding of the epidemiology of youth violence by analyzing the role of the school as a mediating protective factor. We theorize that improving the school environment is an important mediating factor in reducing aggregate rates of youth violence and victimization. Improving school environments can also putatively foster changing systemic aspects of communities linked to youth violence (e.g., disorder, social cohesion, collective efficacy). Given the lack of experimental evidence, we rely on natural experiments to generate exogenous variation in school environments and assess their effects on youth violence at multiple levels including state, districts, and schools. This approach is commonly used to estimate a causal impact on academic achievement, but has not been applied widely to youth violence outcomes. Our methodology relies on within-state, within-district and within- school variation via fixed effects regressions and, where relevant, instrumental variables and propensity score approaches to estimate the effects on youth violence. We will also disaggregate our estimates by race/ethnicity. The study will be among the first efforts to assess the effects of broad-based social policy efforts aimed at improving school environments on youth violence outcomes at state, district, and school levels. Through the analysis of surveillance data on youth violence and victimization outcomes collected by school districts, law enforcement, and public health departments, we can provide an epidemiological assessment of school effects on youth violence in the community. This project addresses the goals of Healthy People 2010 focus areas of Injury and Violence Prevention. Youth violence imposes enormous costs on individuals and society and its harms are particularly acute among minority populations. The proposed study will expand our understanding of the epidemiology of youth violence by analyzing the role of the school as a mediating protective factor in reducing these harms.

"""Development and Crash Injury Risk in Adolescent Latino Males""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unintentional injury remains the leading cause of death in children over age one. This is no different for children entering and traversing the adolescent period of life (age 10 - age 18). While adolescence has been described as a development period of strength and resilience, experts have highlighted the dual paradox that exists during this time of life. This dual paradox describes adolescence as a time of increased injury-related morbidity and mortality rates despite it also being a time of acquiring greater physical strength and capacity for decision-making. Because of their higher than expected mortality rate as they navigate the adolescent and emerging adult period of life, Latino adolescent males have been identified as the anomaly to the Latino Epidemiological Paradox. Cause of death during this time is largely attributed to motor vehicle crashes. The research proposed in this application will explore adolescent developmental sources of crash risk in the context of Latino and youth culture. The first component of this research program will involve analysis of data sets from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. It will provide longitudinal information on adolescent friend influence on risky driving behavior in the general population. The second component will involve comprehensive in-depth interviews of Latino adolescent males in order gain greater insight into Latino and youth culture and risky driving behavior. The last research component will utilize survey and diaries methodologies to elucidate the social context of risky driving in Latino adolescents and how this changes over the adolescent and emerging adult periods of life.  Successfully completing this training and research, the applicant will acquire a skill set needed to become an independent clinical investigator. Furthermore, the information gained will lead to broader understanding of injury disparity in Latino adolescent males and be applied to future development of a clinical contact injury prevention intervention.         ","""Development and Crash Injury Risk in Adolescent Latino Males""",7885988,K23HD050630,"['Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' injury prevention ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Future ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' Health ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Investigation ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' skills ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Friends ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Latino ', ' driving behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' injured ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' decision-making capacity ', ' ']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2009,125750,0.05304398261450578
"Family Obligation and Assistance Among Adolescents with Mexican Backgrounds Families with Latino backgrounds now represent the largest ethnic minority group in the United States, and adolescents wtihin the$8 families face substantial challenges to their psychological and behavioral adjustment. Emerging evidence indicates that traditional family values and practices may play a critical role in shaping Latino adolescents' risk for a number of problematic outcomes, including externalizing behavior problems, substance use, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and school disengagement and dropout. Family obligation and assistance have been identified as key elements of famHy relationships among famUies with Mexican baCkgrounds, the single largest LaUno ethnic group.

Withoutltlis information, it Is difficult to develop meaningful programs and policies that focus on this growing population of adolescents. The proposed research study fills th is gap in prior research by taking an approach that family membership functions as a social identity for adolescents from Mexican backgrounds, and uses several prInciples of Social Identity Tl1eory in order to address four kay questions: (1) How ara family obligation and assistance socialized within families from Mexican backgrounds?: (2) How does actuallamily assistan~ depend upon the families' daily needs and routines?; (3) How does lamily obligation and assistance impact adolescents' emotional and behavioral adjustment?; and (4) How do the dynamics of family obligation and assistance vary aCCOl""ding 10 characteristics of the adolescents' themselves? The proposed stud~' will address these key questions employing mixed methods, including traditional quantitative interviews, daily diary checktists, and qualitative IntervieWS. The study will take place in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, a primary location of families wilh Mexican backgrounds in the United Slates. A total of 540 adolescents wi! be recruited from the ninth and tenth grades of three high schools. Adolescents and their parents will comptete a personal interview and a fourteen day diary checklist for two consecutive years.

"Reducing Behavioral Health Disparities for Black Youth Phase II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antisocial behavior and violence are a national crisis disproportionately affecting Black youth (Cicchetti & Lynch, 1993; Prothrow-Stith & Spivak,1992). A vast health disparity exists in which Black youth are significantly more likely to both be identified as exhibiting antisocial behavior and to be the victim of others' antisocial acts. For example, victimization rates for violent crimes are greater than 750% higher for Black adolescents compared to White adolescents (Centers for Disease Control, 2004; Rachuba, Stanton, & Howard, 1995). The lack of culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions for Black youth exacerbates the problem and hinders access to mental health services among Blacks (Mandersheid & Sonnenschen, 1996). The goal of this Phase II project is to continue the research and development (R&D) of a child small group social-behavioral intervention curriculum, Celebrating the Strengths of Black Youth (CSBY), specifically designed to be culturally relevant and effective for Black youth. This Phase II project will build on Phase I findings to offer an innovative, much needed resource for preventing and decreasing existing behavioral health disparities in Black children (ages six to eight years old). CSBY will offer multi-media resources, including videos and interactive computer resources, and a skill-based curriculum specifically aimed at enhancing social and behavioral competencies. CSBY not only offers mental health (MH) professionals a significant advancement over what is currently available for use with Black youth, but it also provides a unique means of bridging intervention settings with home efforts to promote cross-environment generalization in social and behavioral functioning. During Phase II, the complete CSBY product will be developed, revised, and extended through a series of Alpha and Beta tests. During the course of product development, the 3-C development team will draw on the Advisory Council forthis project, as well as relevant3-C Scientific Advisory Board members to review product materials, provide feedback, and aid development through resources and contacts, as needed. The planned iterative development and feedback by diverse stakeholders will produce a product that will be widely applicable, usable, and acceptable, thereby increasing its commercial potential. Once completed, the CSBY Beta prototype will be scientifically evaluated. In addition to program engagement and product evaluation measures, the efficacy of CSBY for enhancing children's social and behavioral functioning will be empirically tested through randomized trials within both school- and community-based settings. It is expected that Black youth participating in CSBY will be more engaged in treatment and show greater improvement on social- behavioral indices compared to Black youth participating in an established generally-applicable social skills program (i.e., S.S.GRIN; DeRosier, 2006). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antisocial behavior and violence among youth has become a national health crisis for which Black youth are disproportionately at risk (Cicchetti & Lynch, 1993; Prothrow-Stith & Spivak,1992). However, existing research on the effectiveness of specific strategies to reduce and prevent youth violence remains challenged by increasing diversity and the need to provide services that are both developmentally and culturally appropriate. The proposed product is consistent with what has been identified by several legislative mandates as necessary in addressing the challenges of providing health care to differing ethnicities and fostering the development of cultural competence in service providers. The proposed product is also consistent with priorities identified by NICHD to help reduce or eliminate health disparities among racial and ethnic minority populations (NICHD, 2000) as well as recommendations by the Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health (U.S. DHHS, 2001) for ""tailoring services to meet the needs of all Americans, including racial and ethnic minorities"".             ",Reducing Behavioral Health Disparities for Black Youth Phase II,7629765,R44HD049938,"['Crime ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Preparation ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' discount ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' indexing ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' satisfaction ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Respondent ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Letters ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Staging ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sales ', ' Schools ', ' Socialization ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Attitude ', ' Writing ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Test Result ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' skills training ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' small social group ', ' Books ', ' resource guides ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' member ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' anti social ', ' antisocial ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Certification ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Training Technics ', ' Training Technique ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Mental Health Services ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 8 year old ', ' eight year old ', ' age 8 years ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' treatment effect ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' youth violence prevention ', ' prevent youth violence ', ' product development ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Computers ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NICHD,3-C INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT,R44,2009,336864,0.024983209238213504
"Determinants and disparities in high-risk sexual behaviors in US adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preventing youths' high-risk sexual behaviors represent some of the most difficult and important challenges for social and behavioral scientists. This study will identify factors contributing to youths' high-risk sexual behaviors and their disparities. The objectives involve testing a causal model of sexual behaviors guided by the theory of triadic influence (TTI; Flay & Petraitis, 1994), a model well-tested in predicting other adolescent risk behaviors that specifies the operation of key proximal factors as well as more distal factors. Consistent with TTI, proximal factors will include self-efficacy, attitudes, and social norms; distal factors include global positive expectancies, depressive symptoms, parental relatedness, and academic orientation. Finally, potentially vital socio-cultural influences will be tested as ultimate (most distal) factors in the model. Global expectancies and cultural orientation in Latinos are two important factors of emphasis in the model that are understudied within comprehensive models of adolescents' sexual behaviors. The objectives will be accomplished through secondary analyses of Add Health data (National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health) collected from 1994-2002. These data (N = 20,745 at Wave I; N = 14,738 at Wave II; N = 15,197 at Wave III) afford very strong tests of the model from mid-adolescence through young adulthood. These data include reports from friends, partners and parents, and also have substantial proportions of Latino youth (including substantial Mexican Americans, but also over samples of Cuban American and Puerto Rican youth) and African Americans. Behavioral outcomes of focus at both follow-ups include reported early intercourse, unprotected sexual intercourse, and number of sexual partners. Additionally, reported unintended pregnancies, reported STDs, and positive tests on STD assays at Wave III will be included both to validate the behavioral reports and to provide further testing of the model's predictive efficacy. Cutting edge analysis techniques appropriate for longitudinal data such as structural equation, survival, and multi-level modeling will be employed to achieve the study objectives. By clarifying the causal paths leading to these behaviors and identifying which specific protective or risk factors are most critical for adolescent groups where disparities are apparent, the proposed project may aid in the development of more effective sexual-risk reduction programs designed for diverse adolescent populations. Adolescent sexual risk taking behaviors are major causes of premature death and disability in the US as well as lead to unplanned pregnancies. Despite evidence suggesting differing patterns of sexual behaviors between and within ethnic groups, the role of socio-cultural factors within comprehensive theory-guided models of the determinants of high-risk sexual behaviors have been relatively untested. By clarifying such factors like cultural orientation within such a theoretical model, this study will assist preventive programs in their efforts to address the most critical sexual risk taking deterrence factors for diverse adolescent groups.          ",Determinants and disparities in high-risk sexual behaviors in US adolescents,7567499,R03HD053590,"['Cuban American ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Distal ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' disability ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' insight ', ' sex development ', ' Sexual Development ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Parents ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Social Class ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' Attitude ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Equation ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' meetings ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' theories ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Coitus ', ' Communities ', ' birth control ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' efficacy testing ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R03,2009,74563,0.07030699568014026
"HIV Prevention and Partner Abuse: Developing an Intervention for Adolescent Girls    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This K01 Career Development Award proposes to establish a rigorous academic foundation for a research career devoted to developing and testing novel interventions for reducing HIV risk for adolescents. Thematically, the K01 will address the social context of HIV risk by integrating effective theory-based adolescent HIV prevention with promising partner abuse prevention strategies, emphasizing promotion of healthy relationships. It uses family planning clinics as a venue for providing a skill-based, culturally-tailored HIV and partner abuse prevention educational and advocacy program for African American girls living is economically disadvantaged circumstances. Partner abuse, which significantly increases risk for HIV, disproportionately affects low income African-American adolescent girls, as does HIV. Critical to this project is the candidate's demonstrated ability to conduct HIV/STD research in partnership with minority communities, a long term engagement in interdisciplinary scholarship aimed at improving health and a 20- year history as a primary care provider. However, to meet her long term career objective she requires additional instruction and mentorship in 6 key areas: 1) Methods for developing theory-driven, culture- specific, developmental^ appropriate curricula in HIV prevention intervention; 2) Design and evaluation of RCT prevention programs with specific considerations for reducing HIV risk associated with partner violence among adolescent girls; 3) Advanced skills in statistical analysis, particularly techniques relevant to intervention research; 4) Study in HIV and intimate partner violence among adolescents, with special attention to racial, economic and gender disparities; 5) Responsible conduct of research with particular attention to legal and ethical considerations for adolescent HIV and partner abuse issues; 6) Manuscript preparation skills. The research plan is divided into two phases, both guided by social cognitive and gender theory. In phase 1 we will conduct focus groups and individual interviews in order to develop and tailor the HIV/partner abuse intervention for adolescent girls and in phase 2 we will evaluate the initial acceptability and feasibility of this intervention in a limited RCT. Over the 5 years of the award, instruction, training, mentorship, and applied experiences are expected to significantly enhance the candidate's skills and expertise as a researcher and also contribute greatly to launching an independent research program.           ",HIV Prevention and Partner Abuse: Developing an Intervention for Adolescent Girls,7548593,K01MH080649,"['HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' male ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Anger ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' tool ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Scholarship ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Societies ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Partner Abuse ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Manuscripts ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Emotional ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' girls ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Instruction ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' Teen Dating Violence ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' relationship abuse ', ' abusive relationship ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' sexual violence ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Family Planning ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Control Groups ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Provider ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Legal ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Advocacy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cognitive ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Family ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' physical abuse ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' partner violence ', ' violent partner ', ' problem, partner, abuse, violent ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2009,155810,0.08802253057278661
"HIV Risk Among African American Females: Testing the Theory of Gender and Power    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research focuses on African American female adolescents and young adults, a population that is overrepresented in rates of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, in the United States. To understand why African American female adolescents and young women are vulnerable to HIV/STDs, contextual factors must be considered. The public health adaptation of the sociological theory of gender and power (TGP) provides a framework of social structural constructs that may be used to model contextual determinants of HIV/STD preventive behavior such as consistent condom use and it is one of the major underlying theoretical frameworks guiding the design of three evidence-based interventions for young women. The TGP describes three structures: the sexual division of labor, the structure of affective attachments and social norms, and the sexual division of power. These are hypothesized to generate acquired risks and individual risk factors for disease. This study seeks to test and validate a structural equation model of the direct and indirect effects of acquired social and relational risks and individual risk factors on consistent condom use among African American female adolescents and young women based on the TGP. The findings will address the NIMH Division of AIDS and Health and Behavior Research goal of HIV prevention research aimed at better-understanding the multiple levels of dyadic, social and structural factors that impact HIV risk. This study is a secondary analysis of data collected during AFIYA, a randomized controlled trial of an HIV prevention maintenance intervention for young African American women, currently funded by NIMH. Behavioral data derived in part from the TGP is being collected from 800 African American young women, ages 15-20. Multiple associations between selected theoretical constructs will be tested using structural equation modeling with the baseline data. The sample will be randomly split into two datasets; one dataset will serve to develop the model and the other dataset will be used to validate the model.       Public Health Relevance: An objective of Healthy People 2010 is to increase the proportion of adolescents who abstain from sexual intercourse or use condoms if currently sexually active. To better understand sexual behavior among African American female adolescents and young women it is crucial to account for social and relational influences. An empirical test of how the social structural theory of gender and power predicts condom use can provide insight into how to measure and model the associations among the constructs, extending the utility of a theory that has been used extensively to guide the design of HIV prevention interventions.           ",HIV Risk Among African American Females: Testing the Theory of Gender and Power,7678584,F31MH082635,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' physical abuse ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Health behavior ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' insight ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' sexual relationship ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' sexually active ', ' Employment Status ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Maintenance ', ' Americas ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Religious Belief ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' self esteem ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Social Welfare ', ' welfare ', ' Knowledge ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Behavior ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Equation ', ' age group ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Prevention Research ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' emotional abuse ', ' mental abuse ', ' Psychological abuse ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' social attachment ', ' social bonding ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' abstracting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Accounting ', ' Communication ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Affective ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' depression ', ' consistent condom use ', ' surveillance data ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,17189,0.04339830175227199
"AMICA: Assessing Fit of Motivational Interviewing by Cultures with Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic adolescents experience more severe alcohol-related consequences due to their alcohol abuse and yet significantly fewer Hispanic adolescents receive alcohol treatment, particularly among justice-involved youth. Despite the level of research that has been conducted on motivational interviewing (MI) with mainstream samples, no published studies have investigated the efficacy of this brief, individual intervention with Hispanic adolescents. The overarching objective of this application is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief individual intervention (MI) for problem drinking behaviors with a sample of justice-involved Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents to determine if this intervention is differentially effective between Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents. Specifically, the first aim is to determine whether an MI intervention targeting alcohol abuse is effective at reducing alcohol use and related risk behavior in a sample of adolescent alcohol abusers. The second aim is to examine whether the effects of MI on problem drinking outcomes (e.g., alcohol problems, quantity of drinking, frequency of binging) are different between Hispanic versus Caucasian adolescents. Because it is important to determine the mechanisms that mediate the effects of MI and determine whether these mechanisms differ between Caucasian and Hispanic adolescents, the third aim is to examine whether group (Hispanic vs. Caucasian) moderates the meditational linkages in the overall model using a cross-groups approach to moderated mediation (Aiken, Stein, & Bentler, 1994; Bentler, 1995). To accomplish these aims, 453 Caucasian and Hispanic justice-involved alcohol abusing adolescents (ages 14-17) will be randomized to either two 60 minute MI interventions (one at baseline and a second, one week later) or an assessment only control condition (AO). All adolescents will receive behavioral assessments at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. The proposed research is expected to take a significant step towards reducing current racial/ethnic health disparities in alcohol treatment for Hispanic adolescents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the advances made in developing efficacious brief alcohol abuse interventions for mainstream adolescents, no studies have evaluated the efficacy of brief (2 session) individual alcohol abuse interventions for Hispanic adolescents. In the face of their higher need, but lower likelihood of receiving effective alcohol interventions, this research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a brief intervention, motivational interviewing (MI), with Hispanic adolescents. This research will also identify potential culturally-specific moderators in problem drinking outcomes following this brief intervention. This research will take a significant step towards reducing current racial/ethnic health disparities and improving alcohol treatment for Hispanic adolescents.           Despite the advances made in developing efficacious brief alcohol abuse interventions for mainstream adolescents, no studies have evaluated the efficacy of brief (2 session) individual alcohol abuse interventions for Hispanic adolescents.

"Factors Associated with Teens' Non-Responsiveness to HIV Intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am committed to a career in HIV/STD prevention research. To become a fully independent investigator, I am applying for the NIMH Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) to augment my training and research in HIV/STD prevention research for vulnerable adolescents. Towards this goal, I will participate in courses, workshops, seminars, and mentoring meetings to enhance my existing knowledge and research skills, and acquire new knowledge and research skills specific to the design, implementation, adaptation and evaluation of HIV/STD prevention programs for adolescents. My proposed research plan, to be conducted at Emory University and the Fulton County Department of Health and Wellness, in Atlanta, Georgia, with the guidance of my Mentors (Primary Mentor: R. DiClemente, Co-Mentors: G. Wingood and S. Kalichman), can contribute significantly to the field of adolescent HIV prevention science in substantive and practical ways. Study 1 is a mixed-method study patterned after research conducted by my Co-Mentor (Dr. Kalichman), designed to: 1) identify the proportion of African-American female adolescents exposed to an HIV intervention that do not change their condom use, and 2) describe the personal, behavioral and psychosocial factors associated with ""failure to change"" condom use following an HIV intervention. Data from Study 1 directly informs Study 2. In Study 2, I will adapt an existing effective gender and culturally tailored adolescent HIV intervention developed by my Mentors (Dr. DiClemente, & Dr. Wingood), to enhance its efficacy for promoting condom use among African-American female adolescents who did not change their condom use after participating in an HIV intervention. The adaptation process will be guided by a sequential and systematic adaptation model, developed by Drs. Wingood and DiClemente, to facilitate the adaptation process. Study 2 is also a pilot test of the effectiveness of the adapted SiHLE intervention for this subgroup of non-responsive adolescents. The findings from the two studies in this application will make significant contributions to our understanding of adolescent sexual risk behavior and the development of effective HIV interventions which could modify the risk trajectory for HIV acquisition in hard-to-change adolescents.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV prevention interventions tailored for African-American adolescent females who are non-responsive to sexual behavior risk-reduction interventions are urgently needed as these individuals are at especially high- risk for contracting HIV/STDs. The adoption of the adapted SiHLE intervention by other health departments and community-based AIDS service organizations has the potential to reach a broad audience and a population substantially impacted by the HIV epidemic.           ",Factors Associated with Teens' Non-Responsiveness to HIV Intervention,7685682,K01MH085506,"['Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Exposure to ', '

"Partnership to Address Physical Activity among Low-Income Latino Adolescent Girls    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The aims of the Physical Activity Partnership for Girls (PG) are to: 1) build a strong community-academic partnership and assess community priorities and needs for physical activity (PA) promotion among Latino adolescent girls (age ll-14yr) in Westside San Antonio, Texas; 2) design, jointly, an intervention to increase moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) and reduce sedentary behavior among Latino adolescent girls that can be offered and sustained through Girl Scouts (GS) of Southwest Texas and incorporates low-cost, mobile, and wireless technology to promote health and connect youth to community resources; and, 3) use a group randomized trial design to pilot test the PA intervention to ascertain its feasibility and effects among Latino adolescent girls. In year 1, we propose to conduct formative assessments and develop the intervention in full partnership with two local organizations in the target area, one serving youth and one serving families, as well as other community partners via a Community Advisory Board. Data gathered from 4 parent focus groups (~50 participants), 10 in-depth interviews, 5 GS groups (~60 participants) using the photovoice assessment strategy, and 100 media survey participants will inform the development of an intervention to promote MVPA and reduce sedentary behaviors among Latino adolescent girls. In year 2, the intervention will be implemented in the Westside by GS troop leaders with guidance and support from research staff. Standardized assessments will occur at baseline, 3-months, and 6-months and PA will be assessed using accelerometers and PA recall questionnaires. We hypothesize that a significantly higher percententage of participants randomized to the PA intervention will meet the PA recommendation for MVPA (60 min/d) and sedentary behavior (<2 hr/d) compared to those randomized to the usual GS program (primary outcomes); show greater increases in social support, self-efficacy, enjoyment of PA, cardiorespiratory fitness, and less gain in weight and Body Mass Index (secondary outcomes) compared to the control group.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): Hispanic adolescent girls are burdened with high levels of obesity and are less active than the general adolescent population.

"Obesity in Minority Youth in Los Angeles: A Generation ""At Risk""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall Focus: We propose a Comprehensive NCMHD Research Center of Excellence focused on obesity in Minority Youth. This center will focus on research, translation and training to improve minority health in Hispanic and African American youth, with a major focus on exploring innovative ways to identify, prevent and reduce minority health disparities related to obesity, especially type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This center is based on the principle that obesity and associated disease risk is apparent early in life, and therefore novel interventions early in life are essential public health strategies to reduce the burden of disease-risk into adulthood. Organization: The center, with broad support from the university and its affiliate, the Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, will be led by Michael I. Goran, PhD and Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, PhD, who between them have an impressive track record in minority health research. The Administrative Core will assume leadership on all programmatic and fiscal matters and provide shared resources for data management, subject recruitment, common assays, community translation, and training and mentoring. The Research Core will provide scientific leadership and integration across three synergistic RO1-type projects that share subjects (Hispanic and African American teenagers) and methods, and have both within and between project hypotheses. Project #1 (PI: D Spruijt-Metz) will examine the hypothesis that high sugar meals contribute to fat deposition through an abnormal hormonal milieu that promotes negative moods and low physical activity levels. Project #2 (PI: V Gilsanze) will use an array of advanced imaging techniques to examine the ectopic fat hypothesis in minority adolescents by assessment of various fat depots (subcutaneous, visceral, muscle, liver and pancreas) and intima media thickness across the cascade of disease progression in minority adolescents (lean -> healthy obese -> obese with pre-diabetes -> obese with type 2 diabetes). Project #3 (PI: C Roberts) will examine the hypothesis that resistance training is an ""effective"" exercise intervention for improving insulin sensitivity, ectopic fat, and other risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in minority adolescents. Pilot Study #1 will examine gene expression profiles from various fat depots in obese Hispanic and African American adults undergoing surgical weight loss. Pilot Study #2 will translate the intervention in Project 3 for utility in a home environment. Summary & Significance. The center will support a nexus of health researchers dedicated to reducing obesity-related health disparities in minority youth. The center will provide new information and training that is scalable to community settings and unique programs that will elucidate the biological, behavioral and metabolic factors contributing to obesity and related disease-risk in Hispanic and African American children.          ","Obesity in Minority Youth in Los Angeles: A Generation ""At Risk""",7700962,P60MD002254,[''],NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,P60,2009,769337,0.06561596150218904
"DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A JAMAICAN MOTHER-DAUGHTER HIV RISK-REDUCTION PROGRAM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Caribbean nations, including Jamaica, exhibit HIV rates that are second only to sub-Saharan Africa. Jamaican young women and adolescent girls are at particularly high risk due to a number of cultural factors, gender norms, partnering with older male partners, and lack of knowledge and skills related to sexual refusal and HIV prevention. U.S. studies have shown that mothers may act as a key influence of their daughters' sexual risk beliefs and behaviors. However, no studies have documented these effects outside of the U.S. and no studies have evaluated HIV risk-reduction interventions with Jamaican adolescent girls and their mothers. Hence, the purpose of the proposed project is to partner with the University of the West Indies, Jamaican community based organizations (CBOs) and families in order to develop and test a culture-specific mother-daughter HIV risk-reduction intervention in a randomized pilot field experiment. Specifically, we propose to test whether a culture-specific, theory-based, skill-building intervention with Jamaican adolescent girls and their mothers can directly and/or indirectly reduce these girls' HIV risk-associated sexual behaviors. Jamaican girls, ages 14-18, and their mothers/female guardians will be recruited from CBOs and randomly assigned to either: (a) a mother-daughter HIV risk-reduction intervention condition or (b) a ""no intervention"" control condition. The HIV risk-reduction intervention includes 8 modules scheduled over 2 days and implemented by trained adult Jamaican women recruited from among CBO staff. The mother component is designed to increase parenting behaviors (e.g., parental monitoring, parent-child sexual communication [PCSC]) associated with reduced adolescent sexual risk-taking; the teen component is designed to improve girls' beliefs and skills related to abstinence, sexual negotiation and condom use. A ""no intervention"" control condition is being employed as the proposed project is a pilot study of the HIV risk-reduction intervention. Primary outcomes include mothers'/daughters' reports of parenting behaviors and daughters' self-reports of sexual risk behaviors (sexual intercourse, unprotected sex, condom use, number of partners). Secondary outcomes include mothers' beliefs regarding parenting behaviors and daughters beliefs regarding sexual risk behaviors-the theoretical mediators of intervention effects. Findings from this study will contribute to the development of effective HIV risk-reduction programs for Jamaican adolescent girls and young women.             ",DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A JAMAICAN MOTHER-DAUGHTER HIV RISK-REDUCTION PROGRAM,7650379,R01NR010478,"['Daughter ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' International ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Incidence ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Jamaica ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Parents ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Planning Theory ', ' instrument ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Abstinence ', ' sex abstinence ', ' not sexually active ', ' celibate ', ' abstaining from sex ', ' abstain from sexual intercouse ', ' abstain from sexual activity ', ' abstain from intercouse ', ' Celibacy ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' West Indies ', ' Caribbean Islands ', ' Woman ', ' Wood material ', ' Wood ', ' Work ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' interest ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' intervention program ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' parental monitoring ', ' parent monitoring ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Schedule ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' community organizations ', ' safer sex ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NINR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,580541,0.03319733899408491
"Analysis of neighborhood, school, & indiv level factors on adolescent obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood/adolescent obesity is an epidemic in the United States that disproportionately affects underserved populations. My long-term goal is to examine and address the social determinants that contribute to the exponential rise in obesity in children/adolescents and the current socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in obesity. The aim of my research is to illustrate how social, political, and economic factors such as concentration of poverty shape the food environment of youth. Based on existing research and social epidemiologic theories, viable solutions to the obesity epidemic are entrenched with a) focusing early in the life course on children/adolescents in order to reduce the likelihood of obesity in adulthood and prevent the development of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease and b) examining and ameliorating the social and environmental factors that cause obesity and obesity disparities. In the proposed study, I explore how characteristics of the neighborhood where young people live and where they go to school influence their likelihood of being overweight/obese above and beyond their individual characteristics. In order to achieve these objectives, I am employing a longitudinal research design using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. In the proposed study, I will examine individual, contextual, and social factors that may shape the food environment and therefore affect risk of obesity in adolescents. The research will analyze the effect of environmental factors such as, percent poverty and percent unemployed in census tract and racial composition of schools, on obesity after controlling for covariates such as maternal education, maternal overweight/obese, age, gender, and race/ethnicity. This multilevel inspired study design enables examination of both individual and contextual/compositional variables. The mission of the NIH is to promote scientific research that advances our knowledge and reduces the burden of illness and disability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In light of the growing prevalence of overweight/obesity and its devastating health and social consequences, my proposed study embodies the aims of the NIH by using innovative research strategies to conduct socially responsible research that will improve our understanding of overweight/obesity and help identify effective preventive solutions.             ","Analysis of neighborhood, school, & indiv level factors on adolescent obesity",7613458,F31HD056593,"['Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' obesity risk ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Food ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Chronic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' obesity in children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Poverty ', ' Attenuated ', ' Shapes ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Solutions ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight ', ' Writing ', ' Height ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Censuses ', ' Gender ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' ']",NICHD,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2009,28786,-0.012989844720457519
"The Effects of Prenatal Cocaine Exposure in Adolescence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a continuation of grant R01 DA07957 ""The Effects of Prenatal Cocaine Exposure at School Age,"" a longitudinal study of the prenatal effects of cocaine/polydrug exposure (n=382; 194 cocaine-exposed and 188 non-cocaine-exposed). This study, as well as others, has found differences among prenatally cocaine- exposed children that include deficits in perceptual reasoning, attention, language development and externalizing behavior problems compared to non-exposed children. The effects of environmental lead exposure and the differential impact of caregiver placement have been identified as important determinants of early developmental outcomes in this cohort, indicating the need for continued study at this developmental stage of newly emerging risk behaviors and social stress. We propose following this large cohort from age 15 through 18 years with the overarching objective of determining whether the negative effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on brain development continue to interfere with optimal developmental outcomes, and if cocaine exposure is associated with increased incidence of risky behavior, particularly substance misuse and mental health problems. Adolescents will be assessed using self and caregiver report, interview, bioassay and standardized assessments. Specific aims are to: assess the relationship of prenatal cocaine exposure to cognitive and behavioral outcomes (risk taking and mental health problems) in adolescence and to assess lead levels, iron deficiency, caregiving and environmental correlates of exposure; explore models that assess the relationship of early cognitive deficits and behavior problems to risk taking behaviors in an adolescent high-risk cocaine/polydrug exposed cohort; assess parenting experiences and behaviors of caregivers of cocaine- exposed and non-exposed adolescents; and assess the direct and indirect relationships of prenatal cocaine exposure to adolescent behavioral outcomes. Our model focuses on the mediating effects of earlier deficits in cognitive performance, attention and inhibitory control on risk taking behavior and the moderating effects of gender. Effects of lead exposure, iron deficiency and caregiving environment will be explored using structural equation modeling (SEM) and path modeling. The results of this study will provide the basis for designing culturally sensitive interventions prenatally or early in life that could reduce risky teen behaviors and ultimately reduce serious lifelong health problems including substance dependence, trauma and HIV infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A pattern of attention, behavioral regulation and cognitive problems among prenatally cocaine-exposed infants and children has been identified by this research group as well as others. Results indicate that fetal exposure to cocaine may have specific effects on brain development that can be observed in early cognitive and behavioral outcomes and that outcomes are also influenced by level of environmental lead exposure and caregiving quality. This study hypothesizes that the pattern of deficits found in childhood may translate into greater risk taking behavior including substance misuse and mental health problems in adolescence that can have grave consequences on adult productivity and health. Further research on prenatally cocaine-exposed adolescents will identify key points for the timing and focus of intervention and provide important content for public health messages.           7.

"Perinatal Loss and Bereavement in Non-Hispanic Black Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in infant mortality rates exist between white and non-Hispanic black females despite improved access to prenatal care. In 2004 the preterm related infant mortality rate for non-Hispanic black women was 3.5 times higher than for white women. Adolescent females are among those with the highest rates of perinatal loss. Perinatal loss includes miscarriages, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths within the first 28 days of life. Pregnancy loss in adolescents has been linked to an increase in depressive symptoms as well as significant emotional, physical, social and cognitive grief responses. There is evidence that low socio-economic status and developmental factors are markers that increase the risk for complicated grieving. There are few published studies that describe the perinatal bereavement experience in black women, thus, very little is known about the experience of perinatal loss and the subsequent bereavement support needs in non-Hispanic black adolescents. This paucity of research has created a gap in knowledge for nurses who desire to offer culturally sensitive, evidence-based support to help young black women cope with bereavement following the loss of an infant. The overarching goal of this study is to build an understanding of the experience of perinatal bereavement in non-Hispanic black adolescent females. The specific aims are: 1) to generate a disclosive theory that describes the experience of perinatal bereavement in non-Hispanic black female adolescents; 2) to identify critical transitions in the perinatal bereavement process that may signal a need for culturally sensitive bereavement support services. This study is aligned with the NINR's strategic objectives to improve the quality of life, to eliminate health disparities, and to improve care at the end of life across all age spans. A qualitative research design using grounded theory methods is proposed. Unmarried, non-Hispanic black females, aged 16-18 years who have experienced a perinatal loss by stillbirth or neonatal death (first 28 days of life) will be interviewed at three points in time over a period of three months. Constant comparative data analysis will be used.       Relevance to public health: There is a high rate of infant mortality in non-Hispanic black females; hence there is an urgent need to study the phenomenon of perinatal bereavement in black adolescents. This study is important because it will inform nurses about the perinatal loss and bereavement experience of non-Hispanic black adolescent females. Understanding critical transitions in the bereavement process may provide nurses the opportunity to offer culturally sensitive perinatal bereavement support. This study will be foundational to direct future studies to build and test bereavement support interventions.           ",Perinatal Loss and Bereavement in Non-Hispanic Black Adolescents,7752928,F31NR010816,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Caring ', ' Improve Access ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' Perinatal ', ' Goals ', ' Grief reaction ', ' Grief ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Postneonatal Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Interview ', ' Living Wills ', ' living will ', ' Methods ', ' Nurses ', ' Prenatal care ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' neonatal death ', ' neonatal demise ', ' Woman ', ' Bereavement ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Stillbirth ', ' experience ', ' Pregnancy loss ', ' social ', ' Spontaneous abortion ', ' Miscarriage ', ' Emotional ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' response ', ' Unmarried ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' coping ', ' aged ', ' comparative ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NINR,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,F31,2009,33685,0.06710481397641437
"Correlates of Physical Activity in Adolescents with Intellectual Disabilities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regular physical activity plays an important role in health and disease prevention. Children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities (ID) have poorer health than other populations and their lack of physical activity may contribute to the health disparities that have been identified in people with disabilities. Evidence supports that children and adolescents with ID do not engage in sufficient physical activity, that their fitness is low, and that they are more sedentary than their typically developing peers. However, research on physical activity in children and adolescents with ID is limited. To inform the development of effective physical activity interventions in adolescents with ID, it is imperative to first examine their activity levels and to understand the factors associated with their participation. Physical activity is known to be influenced by many individual, psychosocial, behavioral, and environmental factors, but the factors are likely to be different in children and adolescents with ID due to their limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviors, which may limit their opportunities and abilities to participate. The specific aims of this project are: 1) to compare time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity and in structured activities between adolescents ages 13-18 with ID and typically developing adolescents; 2) to compare time spent in sedentary behavior between adolescents with ID and typically developing adolescents; and 3) to compare the individual, family, and community factors associated with physical activity and sedentary behavior between adolescents with ID and typically developing adolescents. Sixty adolescents ages 13-18 with mild ID and 60 typically developing adolescents of comparable chronological age and gender will participate in the study. Physical activity levels will be objectively measured using accelerometers over 7 consecutive days. Through questionnaires and interviews with the adolescent participants and their parents, we will gather information on demographics, adolescent and parent participation in physical activity, barriers and supports to physical activity, the importance that parents and adolescents place on physical activity, and adolescent enjoyment and self-efficacy in relation to physical activity. The health needs of children and adolescents with ID have been under-represented in research efforts, and thus, they represent an under-served minority. The proposed project seeks to address this gap by describing the physical activity patterns of adolescents with ID and comparing them to their typically developing peers. We will also identify the individual, family, and community factors associated with physical activity to determine whether they are different than those found in typically developing adolescents. This information will have direct implications for informing the development of physical activity programs specific to meeting the needs of adolescents with intellectual disabilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The US Department of Health and Human Services has identified major heath disparities in children, adolescents, and adults with intellectual disabilities (mental retardation). The poor health of this population may be caused in part by low levels of physical activity, and the government's agenda for improving health includes physical activity promotion. Physical activity is listed prominently as a leading health indicator in Healthy People 2010, and objectives include improving activity levels and reducing sedentary behavior in children. Developing effective health promotion programs for children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities requires an in-depth understanding of their physical activity levels and of the factors uniquely related to behavior.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The US Department of Health and Human Services has identified major heath disparities in children, adolescents, and adults with intellectual disabilities (mental retardation).

"Partner Age Discordance and HIV Risk Behaviors in Adolescent Girls (Sexual RP)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent girls in violent or controlling relationships are likely to be at higher risk for HIV and STIs. Their risk of relationship violence or power imbalances may be greater when the partner is two or more years older. The purpose of this study is to test a proposed model of the correlations between sexual relationship power and intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV risk related sexual behaviors in a sample of at-risk adolescent girls. The model is derived from Blanc's evidence-based framework for assessing the relationship between gender power relations and reproductive health in populations as risk for power imbalances. Specifically, the study aims to investigate the relationship of sexual partners' age discordance of more than two years to high-risk sexual behavior, in adolescent girls ages 14-18, as well as the mediating role of sexual relationship power and IPV in that relationship. A cross-sectional, descriptive, survey design will be used to evaluate the model of Proposed Predictors of Sexual Risk in Adolescent Girls. Data will be collected from 150 sexually active adolescent girls at an urban school-based health center, in a low-income neighborhood. Data collection will be done via a self-administered, computer-assisted survey, Promote Health, which will analyze responses and format a report with health information, referrals, and resources specific to the individual participant. Data will be analyzed for main effects of demographic variables, including age of adolescent girl, race/ethnicity and acculturation status, and history of physical or sexual abuse. If main effects are determined, then these factors will be controlled for in regression analysis. The role of sexual relationship power and IPV as mediators of the relationship among partner age discordance and high risk sexual behaviors will be determined through multiple regression analysis. Sub-analyses will be conducted to further investigate the correlations among variables, for example sexual relationship power and IPV. The proposed research questions are critical in addressing the needs for early intervention in HIV/STD prevention for adolescent girls, who are at high risk for IPV and one of the fastest growing groups infected with HIV and other STIs. Understanding the prevalence and effects of power imbalances in romantic relationships is essential in developing strategies to reduce HIV, other STIs, and IPV. If relationship factors, such as age discordance, relative power, and violence increase the likelihood of sexual risk behaviors in at-risk adolescent girls, this knowledge can be used to shape questions asked in clinical risk assessment, and to develop prevention interventions and public health policy.          ",Partner Age Discordance and HIV Risk Behaviors in Adolescent Girls (Sexual RP),7556355,F31MH082646,"['Data Collection ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Laws ', ' statutory rape ', ' sexual relationship ', ' Individual ', ' sexually active ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' sex abuse ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rosa ', ' Rose ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Behavior ', ' age group ', ' Participant ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' community intervention ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' relationship violence ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,F31,2009,28211,0.05753459052159543

The knowledge and experience obtained will be used to investigate the role of the physical and social macro-environments on adolescent behavior substance use, physical activity, and dietary habits. Despite the growth in empirical research on neighborhood environmental characteristics and their influence on adolescent health behaviors, much remains to be learned. Many researchers have not gone beyond the two-level conceptualizations of a multilevel model, yet it is reasonable to assume that adolescent health is influenced by numerous levels. Adolescents will be nested not only within their neighborhoods but also within their family or household unit providing a unique and rare opportunity to examine multiple levels of influence. Although there have been calls to modify environments to reduce negative health outcomes, most work has focused on the micro-environment (e.g., home, school influences). This study will use the unique opportunity of georeferenced national survey data on a racially diverse sample of adolescents included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Primary Aims are:1) to develop neighborhood-level measures that characterize physical and social neighborhood factors thought to influence adolescent health behavior; 2) to evaluate whether characteristics of the physical and social environment explain a substantial proportion of the variance in adolescent health behaviors; 3) to determine moderators of the association between the physical and social environment and adolescent health behavior; and 4) to identify racial and ethnic disparities in health behavior and to examine whether physical and characteristics of the neighborhood where an adolescent resides explains disparities. The skills gained during the proposed training will provide the candidate with the requisite training to become a strong independent investigator in neighborhood influences on health and specifically, adolescent health.           ",RESEARCH AND TRAINING ON CONTEXTUAL EFFECTS IMPACTING ADOLESCENT HEALTH,8186872,K01SH000002,[''],NCHS,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,K01,2009,30819,0.09184049337315198
"Biopsychosocial Determinants of Adolescent Obesity/Cardiovascular Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of adolescent obesity is high in the U.S., and in Latin America. While dramatic environmental changes in the food and physical environment are associated with increased risk, there continues to be inadequate understanding of the individual, family and community level factors that protect against the development of obesity. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms leading to disparate risk for obesity in low-income and Hispanic/Latino youth. The proposed 5-year project aims to elucidate interconnected biological and social pathways associated with adolescent obesity and risk for later development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This application involves approximately 620 Chilean adolescents, assessed in infancy, 3 to 5 years and 10 years as part of a NIH-supported cohort study of the behavioral and developmental effects of preventing iron deficiency anemia in infancy (n = 1645). As such, detailed longitudinal data related to growth, health and development have been collected. At 16 to 17 years, the youth will participate in study of activity, sleep and eating patterns using actigraphic recording and laboratory assessment of eating behavior. In addition, we will measure anthropometry, fat and muscle mass (DXA), fasting glucose, insulin (HOMA IR), lipids, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, orexin, CRP, and TNF alpha. Detailed information about family history, smoking, health, and psychosocial functioning will also be collected. Neighborhood level factors such as crime, walk ability and resources for physical activity and healthful food attributes will be assessed. Furthermore, a sizeable subset (n = 237) with sleep neurophysiology and actigraphic recordings at multiple time points will participate in 2-night polysmnographic sleep study at 16 years. Guided by a life-course approach, we propose to investigate three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1 - To evaluate biological and psychosocial determinants of obesity and related metabolic disturbance in a cohort of adolescents followed since early infancy. Specific Aim 2 - To assess associations between obesity/adiposity and biomarkers of adiposity-related metabolic disturbance in this sample of Chilean adolescents. Specific Aim 3 - To assess the role of circadian patterns of physical activity, sleep and eating behavior on adiposity and related metabolic disturbance. The long standing collaboration between the Institute for Nutrition and Technology at the University of Chile and the Center for Human Growth and Development at the University of Michigan provides an outstanding environment to study biological and psychosocial determinants of adolescent obesity in a low- to middle-income cohort of Latin American youth who are very similar in obesity risk to comparable U.S. youth. We expect to advance understanding of how developmental patterns of eating and activity are influenced by early life factors and in turn influence the development of obesity and related metabolic disturbance. Our study is unique in the depth and breadth of longitudinal psychosocial and biological data. We propose research that crosses disciplinary boundaries and has the potential to reveal important determinants of adolescent obesity for future intervention research.

"Risk, Roles and Relationships: Project Prepared    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a two-group randomized trial of Project Prepared, an HIV/STI prevention program for youth aged 12-14. It folds together elements of three interventions we designed for middle adolescents into a comprehensive intervention that is developmentally appropriate for youth in early adolescence. Project Prepared has two parts. First is a 14-session training program held over 7 weeks that covers five major predictors of high risk behavior: developmental na¿vet¿, cognitive factors, gender roles, relationship factors and family formation. It is followed by a 5-week internship that incorporates resilience and youth development through making youth peer educators to other adolescents about HIV/STI risk. Project Prepared is theoretically based, comprehensive, intensive, and appropriate to the developmental stage, race/ethnicity, and social context of inner-city youth of color. It emphasizes skills in avoiding risky sexual situations, and provides medically accurate information about sexual development, sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy. We will conduct a two group randomized trial (n=400) to test the effectiveness of Project Prepared on cognitive factors (HIV/STI knowledge, sexual self-efficacy; intention to use a condom); relationship factors (immature romantic beliefs, relationship self-efficacy), gender norms (macho man, powerless female), and resilience. The control condition will be TEEN, an award winning program with proven effectiveness in reducing psychological symptoms with no HV/STD content.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black and Latino youth are at particular risk for HIV/STIs, but currently available interventions for young adolescents have shown only modest, short term effects. We have developed an intensive, comprehensive HIV/STI prevention program, for youth aged 12-14, Project Prepared. The project is expected to generate important information on sexual risk behavior in early adolescents, and may lead to a new program that is effective in reducing HIV/STI risk for youth in the future.           Black and Latino youth are at particular risk for HIV/STIs, but currently available interventions for young adolescents have shown only modest, short term effects.

"Obesity in Minority Youth in Los Angeles: A Generation ""At Risk""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall Focus: We propose a Comprehensive NCMHD Research Center of Excellence focused on obesity in Minority Youth. This center will focus on research, translation and training to improve minority health in Hispanic and African American youth, with a major focus on exploring innovative ways to identify, prevent and reduce minority health disparities related to obesity, especially type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This center is based on the principle that obesity and associated disease risk is apparent early in life, and therefore novel interventions early in life are essential public health strategies to reduce the burden of disease-risk into adulthood. Organization: The center, with broad support from the university and its affiliate, the Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, will be led by Michael I. Goran, PhD and Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, PhD, who between them have an impressive track record in minority health research. The Administrative Core will assume leadership on all programmatic and fiscal matters and provide shared resources for data management, subject recruitment, common assays, community translation, and training and mentoring. The Research Core will provide scientific leadership and integration across three synergistic RO1-type projects that share subjects (Hispanic and African American teenagers) and methods, and have both within and between project hypotheses. Project #1 (PI: D Spruijt-Metz) will examine the hypothesis that high sugar meals contribute to fat deposition through an abnormal hormonal milieu that promotes negative moods and low physical activity levels. Project #2 (PI: V Gilsanze) will use an array of advanced imaging techniques to examine the ectopic fat hypothesis in minority adolescents by assessment of various fat depots (subcutaneous, visceral, muscle, liver and pancreas) and intima media thickness across the cascade of disease progression in minority adolescents (lean -> healthy obese -> obese with pre-diabetes -> obese with type 2 diabetes). Project #3 (PI: C Roberts) will examine the hypothesis that resistance training is an ""effective"" exercise intervention for improving insulin sensitivity, ectopic fat, and other risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in minority adolescents. Pilot Study #1 will examine gene expression profiles from various fat depots in obese Hispanic and African American adults undergoing surgical weight loss. Pilot Study #2 will translate the intervention in Project 3 for utility in a home environment. Summary & Significance. The center will support a nexus of health researchers dedicated to reducing obesity-related health disparities in minority youth. The center will provide new information and training that is scalable to community settings and unique programs that will elucidate the biological, behavioral and metabolic factors contributing to obesity and related disease-risk in Hispanic and African American children.          ","Obesity in Minority Youth in Los Angeles: A Generation ""At Risk""",7623828,P60MD002254,[''],NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,P60,2009,2022458,0.06561596150218904

"A Culturally Informed Tele-Intervention for Minority High Risk Youth and Parents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (01) Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention and specific Challenge Topic, 06-MD-101* Development of Telehealth Tools to Promote Health and Connect At-Risk Youth to the Health System via Low-Cost, Mobile, and Wireless Technologies. The proposed study is designed to enhance, refine, and test a culturally informed and flexible/tailored intervention for high risk minority adolescents and their parents that is delivered primarily via a mobile/wireless system. This study focuses on high risk African American and Hispanic adolescents and their parents. Rates of HIV, AIDS, STIs, depression and suicide attempts, point to some of the major health disparities that result from an untreated high risk developmental trajectory. The proposed research brings together two teams with strong programs of innovation and research, one with expertise in the use of technology to deliver psychosocial interventions and the PI who has expertise in the development and testing of culturally informed treatments for high risk minority youth. This unique collaboration promises to accelerate each team's individual trajectories and converge on a high innovative tele-intervention for high risk youth. The study: 1) refines and enhances the original Culturally Informed and Flexible Family-Based Treatment for Adolescents (CIFFTA) to meet the needs of African American and Hispanic high risk youth, 2) refines an innovative wireless mobile technology to deliver the intervention in a multi-media format that includes text, audio, video and graphics, 3) pilot tests the new intervention and its delivery system by implementing the intervention with 10 families and conducting focus groups to identify refinements, and 4) conducts a medium-sized randomized trial of 80 African American and Hispanic adolescents ages 12-15 to test for feasibility, acceptability, and to obtain preliminary effect size estimates on key risk factors (conduct problems, academic failure, risky sexual behavior, family conflict). The original CIFFTA was designed to address unique stressors faced by minority youth in a flexible format that leads to the selection of interventions that best ""fit"" the clinical needs and cultural characteristics of the youth. It targets: 1) reducing family risk (e.g., poor parenting practices, family conflict) and increasing protective factors (e.g., Parent-child attachment), 2) teaching adolescent and parents skills, 3) delivering culturally congruent material (e.g., handling discrimination), and 4) using a flexible treatment manual to tailor of the treatment to the unique characteristics and needs of minority families (Santisteban & Mena, in press). By modifying and enhancing the original CIFFTA that has shown promising preliminary data, and adapting it for a wireless and mobile technology that is user friendly for adolescents, the intervention has the potential to mitigate issues of underutilization of services and the inability of interventions to be accessible to youth in the moments they need them most. The intervention will seek to identify the high risk people, times of the day, and locations in the adolescents' lives so that contact is made with youth at those most vulnerable times and interventions can be tailored. Rates of HIV, AIDS, STIs, depression and suicide attempts among African American and Hispanic adolescents, point to some of the major health disparities that can result from an untreated high risk developmental trajectory. The proposed research brings together two teams with strong programs of innovation and research, one with expertise in the use of technology to deliver psychosocial interventions and the PI with expertise in the development and testing of culturally informed and tailored treatments for high risk minority youth.

"Adolescent Violence Exposure and Internalizing and Externalizing Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a training grant for which the main goal is to increase the research proficiency of the applicant, and prepare her to become an independent researcher with expertise in the areas of community violence exposure and African American mental health. Training and scholarship in these areas is important because African American youth are more likely to witness and be victims of community violence exposure, possibly due to the overrepresentation of African Americans in low income neighborhoods. The intensity and severity of the violent events that occur in poorer neighborhoods affects youth in these areas at disproportionate rates and places African American adolescents at a greater risk for many of the negative effects associated with violence exposure, including academic, social, and psychological difficulties. The specific aims for the proposed research are: 1) to expand my knowledge of the development of ethnic minority urban adolescents, with a focus on youth internalizing and externalizing outcomes associated with chronic experiences with violence; 2) to examine factors associated with resilience for youth exposed to violence, and 3) to expand my knowledge of and proficiency with statistical methods and research designs appropriate for studying the effects of violence exposure and perceived neighborhood violence on adolescent mental health. This proposal is for secondary analysis of an existing dataset comprised of an epidemiologically-defined community sample of 585 African American adolescents (53.2% male), who were first assessed during first grade, collected for 5R01MH057005-09, ""Periodic Follow Up of Two Preventative Trials"" (P.I.: Nicholas lalongo). Participants were assessed at regular intervals from elementary school through adolescence resulting in varying sample sizes (Table 1). Youth reported about experiences with violence, and behavioral adjustment also was assessed.

"New HIV Intervention Approaches for African American Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American adolescents are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (CDC, 2007a, 2007b, 2008a), highlighting the importance of further prevention research for this population. The goal of the proposed study is to address these disparities by developing and testing a new intervention approach that focuses on relationships (e.g., the different types of relationships, the context in which youth ""hook up""), as well as factors that might reduce sexual risk taking (e.g., concurrency of sexual partners, norms about the sequencing of romantic and intimate events in relationships), potentially important behavioral aims for African American youth who tend to report having more sexual partners than other racial/ethnic groups (Eaton et al., 2006). The potential effects of the intervention will be tested using a matched pilot-test design involving 2 schools (approximately 400 students), in which the schools are randomly assigned to either the intervention or comparison condition. Youth will be assessed 3 times during the study: baseline, 3 and 6 months following the intervention, providing data on sexual risk taking behaviors (e.g., sexual partners, condom use) and related determinants, such as functional knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, perceived self efficacy, and perceived norms related to relationships and sexual behaviors. The study also will yield data on characteristics of adolescents' relationships (e.g., how romantic relationships are developed, what factors characterize different types of relationships, how adolescents view the quality of their relationships). Consistent with the R21 mechanism, the study findings would yield new data on the potential promise and feasibility of a relationship-based approach to HIV prevention that could be tested in a randomized controlled trial.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American adolescents are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). More effective and accessible interventions are needed to address the HIV/STI related health disparities experienced by these youth. The proposed project has the potential to be of public health significance in the following ways: 1) it provides an additional resource for schools to address HIV/STI risk among youth, particularly African American youth; 2) if effective, a relationships-based approach to HIV would have broad appeal to schools, community-based organizations, and clinics serving adolescents because of its developmental focus; and 3) the study results could yield new insights regarding adolescents' relationships, potentially leading to promising strategies for reaching African American adolescents, an important contribution given the alarming rates of HIV and other STIs among this population group.           STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE African American adolescents are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STI).

"DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A JAMAICAN MOTHER-DAUGHTER HIV RISK-REDUCTION PROGRAM Caribbean nations, including Jamaica, exhibit HIV rates that are second only to sub-Saharan Africa. Jamaican young women and adolescent girls are at particularly high risk due to a number of cultural factors, gender norms, partnering with older male partners, and lack of knowledge and skills related to sexual refusal and HIV prevention. U.S. studies have shown that mothers may act as a key influence of their daughters' sexual risk beliefs and behaviors. However, no studies have documented these effects outside of the U.S. and no studies have evaluated HIV risk-reduction interventionswith Jamaican adolescent girls and their mothers. Hence, the purpose of the proposed project is to partner with the University of the West Indies, Jamaican community based organizations (CBOs) and families in order to develop and test a culture-specific mother-daughter HIV risk-reduction intervention in a randomized pilot field experiment. Specifically, we propose to test whether a culture-specific, theory-based, skill-building intervention with Jamaican adolescent girls and their mothers can directly and/or indirectly reduce these girls' HIV risk-associated sexual behaviors. Jamaican girls, ages 14-18, and their mothers/female guardians will be recruited from CBOs and randomly assigned to either: (a) a mother-daughter HIV risk-reduction intervention condition or (b) a ""no intervention"" control condition. The HIV risk-reduction intervention includes 8 modules scheduled over 2 days and implemented by trained adult Jamaican women recruited from among CBO staff. The mother component is designed to increase parenting behaviors (e.g., parental monitoring, parent-child sexual communication [PCSC]) associatedwith reduced adolescent sexual risk-taking; the teen component is designed to improve girls' beliefs and skills related to abstinence, sexual negotiation and condom use. A ""no intervention"" control condition is being employed as the proposed project is a pilot study of the HIV risk-reduction intervention. Primary outcomes include mothers'/daughters' reports of parenting behaviors and daughters' self-reports of sexual risk behaviors (sexual intercourse, unprotected sex, condom use, number of partners). Secondary outcomes include mothers' beliefs regarding parenting behaviors and daughters beliefs regarding sexual risk behaviors-the theoretical mediators of intervention effects. Findings from this study will contribute to the development of effective HIV risk-reduction programs for Jamaicanadolescent girls and young women.

"Biopsychosocial Determinants of Adolescent Obesity/Cardiovascular Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of adolescent obesity is high in the U.S., and in Latin America. While dramatic environmental changes in the food and physical environment are associated with increased risk, there continues to be inadequate understanding of the individual, family and community level factors that protect against the development of obesity. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms leading to disparate risk for obesity in low-income and Hispanic/Latino youth. The proposed 5-year project aims to elucidate interconnected biological and social pathways associated with adolescent obesity and risk for later development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This application involves approximately 620 Chilean adolescents, assessed in infancy, 3 to 5 years and 10 years as part of a NIH-supported cohort study of the behavioral and developmental effects of preventing iron deficiency anemia in infancy (n = 1645). As such, detailed longitudinal data related to growth, health and development have been collected. At 16 to 17 years, the youth will participate in study of activity, sleep and eating patterns using actigraphic recording and laboratory assessment of eating behavior. In addition, we will measure anthropometry, fat and muscle mass (DXA), fasting glucose, insulin (HOMA IR), lipids, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, orexin, CRP, and TNF alpha. Detailed information about family history, smoking, health, and psychosocial functioning will also be collected. Neighborhood level factors such as crime, walk ability and resources for physical activity and healthful food attributes will be assessed. Furthermore, a sizeable subset (n = 237) with sleep neurophysiology and actigraphic recordings at multiple time points will participate in 2-night polysmnographic sleep study at 16 years.    Guided by a life-course approach, we propose to investigate three Specific Aims:    Specific Aim 1 - To evaluate biological and psychosocial determinants of obesity and related metabolic disturbance in a cohort of adolescents followed since early infancy.    Specific Aim 2  - To assess associations between obesity/adiposity and biomarkers of adiposity-related metabolic disturbance in this sample of Chilean adolescents.    Specific Aim 3 - To assess the role of circadian patterns of physical activity, sleep and eating behavior on adiposity and related metabolic disturbance.    The long standing collaboration between the Institute for Nutrition and Technology at the University of Chile and the Center for Human Growth and Development at the University of Michigan provides an outstanding environment to study biological and psychosocial determinants of adolescent obesity in a low- to middle-income cohort of Latin American youth who are very similar in obesity risk to comparable U.S. youth. We expect to advance understanding of how developmental patterns of eating and activity are influenced by early life factors and in turn influence the development of obesity and related metabolic disturbance. Our study is unique in the depth and breadth of longitudinal psychosocial and biological data. We propose research that crosses disciplinary boundaries and has the potential to reveal important determinants of adolescent obesity for future intervention research. PUBLIC HEATLH RELEVANCE: Adolescent obesity develops during childhood in response to biological factors and social conditions. While biological factors such as genetic inheritance are difficult to change, social factors could be targets for preventive efforts. We expect to further understanding of the environmental and social conditions related to the development of obesity in a high risk urban, Hispanic/Latino population. We are interested in how children develop circadian rhythms related to eating, sleeping and activity, and subsequently how these patterns lead to obesity. Our goal is to unveil modifiable conditions in order to prevent obesity and related diseases including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.          ",Biopsychosocial Determinants of Adolescent

Survival analyses will be conducted on California Cancer Registry data to determine whether neighborhood-level SES affects overall and cancer- specific survival these AYA patients. At the individual level, a questionnaire study administered to patients identified through the California Cancer Registry as having been recently diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma will be conducted. The proportion of patients who were offered participation on a clinical trial, enrolled in a clinical trial, and received the majority of their treatment at a research-based institution will the primary outcome measurements determined. Whether the proportion of these outcomes differs according to person-level socioeconomic indicators will be investigated. The ways in which quality of life, in terms of physical health, psychological and emotional well-being, family and social relationships, and life skills and new experiences have been impacted by cancer in AYA individuals, and whether these effects are attenuated by socioeconomic factors, will also be explored.

"Urethral Microbiome of Adolescent Males    DESCRIPTION: The microflora of the anterior male urethra during adolescence is poorly described and no data address the range of ""typical"" urethral microflora during adolescence as functions of pubertal development or onset of various types of partnered sexual activity. This means that current understanding of the urethral microbiome in adolescent men rests entirely on data drawn from adults, and from epidemiologic and behavioral explanations. Marked ethnic group variation in adolescent sexual behaviors and disparity in conditions such as sexually transmitted infections (STI) justifies exploration of potential ethnic group differences in the male urethral microflora. Some research among adult males suggests important interactions between the male urethral microflora and STI, but this research has not been extended to younger men. Here we propose to characterize the male urethral microbiome in longitudinal urine samples collected from a multi-ethnic cohort of adolescent males. Microbial flora will be assessed as function of pubertal development, sexual activity, and incident STI. Subjects will be Latino (N=24), African-American (N=24), and Euro-American (N=24) males, ages 14 - 17 at enrollment; total N=72).

"Alcohol, Marijuana, and Risky Sex: Group Interventions with Detained Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescents are at great risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including HIV/AIDS, and are one of few HIV risk groups for whom HIV/AIDS incidence is not declining (CDC, 2005a). Compared to the general adolescent population, adolescents involved with the criminal justice system are younger at first intercourse, have a greater number of sex partners, and lower rates of condom use, resulting in higher rates of unintended pregnancy and STDs (e.g., Teplin, Mericle, McClelland & Abram, 2003). Data from our previous research efforts suggests that it is heavy alcohol use in concert with sexual activity, rather than heavy alcohol use generally, that is most strongly related to lack of condom use (Bryan, Ray, & Cooper, in press). Further, we have demonstrated initially higher rates of condom use at follow-up among adolescents who participated in a combined sexual risk reduction + alcohol risk reduction intervention as compared to a sexual risk reduction only intervention and an information only control intervention in our prior NIAAA-supported randomized controlled intervention with incarcerated adolescents, (R01 AA013844-01; Schmiege, Broaddus, Bryan, et al., 2008). The goal of the proposed study is to build on those successful findings, and on our ongoing work (RO1 DA019139-01) and that of others (Lebeau-Craven et al., 2003; Kingree & Betz, 2003) which suggests that marijuana use is more prevalent than alcohol use generally and during sex than is alcohol use among criminally-involved adolescents. In addition, NIDA has noted that marijuana is a specific drug of abuse that may be an emerging risk factor for HIV and STDs, but one for which there is little basic or intervention research. In this continuation, we propose to conduct a second randomized controlled trial to compare an expanded sexual risk reduction intervention that includes both an alcohol component and a marijuana component, to a sexual risk reduction intervention that includes only an alcohol component, and a sexual risk reduction only condition. Each of these interventions includes a standard theory-based didactic presentation of sexual reduction intervention material and a group motivational enhancement therapy component focused on alcohol and marijuana, alcohol use only, or sexual risk behavior only. We hope to show that: 1) combining both substances into one intervention further increases its efficacy at decreasing sexual risk behavior because of its broad coverage of the three most highly prevalent risk behaviors (alcohol, marijuana, and unprotected sex) in this population, 2) it is the substance use content, and not the group MET modality that is responsible for this increased efficacy, and 3) the intervention exerts its effects through theoretically-based mediators. The relative success of these interventions will have implications for HIV/STD risk reduction programming for high risk adolescents in the criminal justice system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescents involved with the criminal justice system are younger at first intercourse, have a greater number of sex partners, and lower rates of condom use than their non criminally-involved counterparts. This high level of sexual risk results in higher rates of unintended pregnancy and STDs including HIV/AIDS. These young people also have extraordinarily high rates of alcohol and marijuana use, and many have demonstrated that substance use plays a causal role in sexual risk. This research is designed to implement and carefully evaluate new intervention technologies that have the goal of decrease alcohol- and marijuana-related sexual risk behavior in this population of highly vulnerable young people.                 Adolescents involved with the criminal justice system are younger at first intercourse, have a greater number of sex partners, and lower rates of condom use than their non criminally-involved counterparts.

"Prime Time: Health Promotion for Multiple Risk Behaviors Prime Time: Health Promotion for Multiple Risk Behaviors is a five-year intervention research study (2005- 2009) with an overall goal to design, implement and evaluate a multi-component intervention among adolescent girls at high risk for early pregnancy that reduces multiple precursors of teen pregnancy including sexual risk taking, violence involvement, and school disconnection. Prime Time targets 13-17 year old girls (n=250) attending school and community clinics in Minneapolis/St Paul who meet specified risk criteria. Using an experimental design, half of study participants are randomly assigned to the intervention condition; half are assigned to the control condition. Intervention participants will be involved with the Prime Time intervention for an 18-month period, while control participants will continue to receive usual clinic services. Self-report data will be collected (via A-CASI surveys) from all study participants at study baseline and at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months following study enrollment. To address core risk and protective factors related to sexual risk behaviors, violence involvement, and school disconnection, the Prime Time intervention employs an innovative combination of previously-tested approaches including one-on-one case management, peer education (Just In Time) and service learning (It's Our Time) experiences. This multi-component intervention was developed and field-tested in the Prime Time pilot study. Using multi-wave data, we evaluate intervention impacts on participants' sexual risk taking and contraceptive behaviors; school connectedness, school misbehavior and school performance; violence involvement and peer-related aggression. We also test the extent to which intervention effects on outcome behaviors are mediated by hypothesized risk and protective factors targeted for change by the Prime Time intervention. If the intervention demonstrates success in preventing risk behaviors, we will actively engage in dissemination efforts to affect best practices in primary care clinics serving adolescent girls.

"Symptom Severity, Treatment Engagement, and Outcomes for Culturally Diverse Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this research proposal is to investigate the patterns and roles of symptom severity and service engagement in community-based mental health services for diverse adolescent populations. Researchers and policy-makers have highlighted the need for a better understanding of the various factors contributing to issues related to mental health service utilization, engagement, and outcomes for ethnic minorities. Unfortunately, empirical research regarding these factors remains sparse. This research proposal addresses gaps in the literature by: 1) Examining the relationship between race/ethnicity and acculturation to symptom severity at treatment entry for a diverse adolescent sample, 2) Examining the relationship between symptom severity and treatment outcomes for a diverse adolescent sample, and 3)   Examining the role of treatment engagement in treatment outcomes for a diverse adolescent sample. The sample will consist of 260 adolescents (aged 12-19) who have received school and clinic-based mental health services, their parents, and their therapists. Secondary data analysis will be based on data collection from a baseline interview and four follow-up interviews over the course of 12 months. Research instruments measure symptom severity, engagement in treatment, sociodemographics, and treatment outcomes. Analysis will involve descriptive statistics, multiple regression models, and moderation and mediation effects on these models/equations.   Findings from this research proposal have potentially significant implications for improving the delivery and quality of care for ethnic minority adolescents.

"A longitudinal multi-level analysis of health disparities among adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healthy People 2010 includes objectives related both to adolescent health and to reducing health disparities. This R21 will examine health disparities over time in demographically defined sub-groups of youth by conducting secondary analyses of the 5 waves of longitudinal data from the Youth Asset Study (YAS). This study's purpose is to examine associations among youth assets, environmental factors, and adolescent risky behaviors across youth sub-groups over a 4 year period. Adolescent health disparities have been shown for race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). Tracking these objectives over time across youth sub-groups is important to assess health disparities and monitor progress of the Healthy People 2010 goals. It is also imperative to determine factors that may be related to these disparities including individual factors such as youth assets as well as environmental factors. We propose to use existing data from the YAS (funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (CDC) Division of Reproductive Health), a 4 year/5 wave longitudinal prospective study that involves youth aged 12-17 years at wave 1 and their parents The study examines associations among neighborhood and family factors, youth assets, and youth risk behaviors. The CDC has funded data collection and data analysis related to sexual risk behaviors. The CDC supports our submission for additional funding for analysis of other outcomes. Data collected includes: 17 assets (e.g. Relationship with Mother, Religiosity, Peer Role Models), youth race/ethnicity, extensive parent reported socioeconomic status (SES) data, and risky behaviors including non-use of seatbelts, riding with drivers who have been drinking alcohol, binge drinking of alcoholic beverages, tobacco use, physical fighting, and weapon carrying. The following specific hypotheses will be examined: 1) Disparities in the proportion of youth participating in risky behaviors will change over time and this change will be different for each race/ethnicity and impacted by SES. 2) The impact of youth assets in the disparate relationship between risky behavior and time will vary by race/ethnicity and SES. 3) Environmental factors (waves 1 & 2) and assets (wave 3) will be associated with risk behavior disparities (waves 4 & 5) differently across race/ethnic groups and impacted by SES. 4) Youth assets (wave 3) will moderate the influence of environmental factors (waves 1 & 2) on behavioral disparities differently across race/ethnic and SES groups. Separate analyses for each of the six risky behaviors will be conducted. To test these hypotheses multi-level longitudinal mixed effect models, marginal models, and structural equation modeling will be utilized. Health disparities related to racial/ethnic groups while controlling for SES will initially be examined by analyzing interactions and then may be further examined by stratifying the data based on race/ethnicity. This information will help explain the role of youth assets and the environment as they relate to youth health disparities for six risky behaviors specifically related to race/ethnicity and SES. Results will help guide interventions developed to eliminate youth health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study will contribute to public health in the general area of youth development theory and specifically to our understanding of how youth assets and environmental factors may decrease health disparities related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status across six risky behaviors in adolescents. Practitioners can use the study results to guide interventions specifically planned at reducing or eliminating youth health disparities related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.           Project narrative The study will contribute to public health in the general area of youth development theory and specifically to our understanding of how youth assets and environmental factors may decrease health disparities related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status across six risky behaviors in adolescents.

"School Environment as a Mechanism to Reduce Youth Violence and Victimization    Description (Provided by Applicant): Youth violence imposes enormous costs on individuals and society. Youth violence is the second leading cause of death among individuals ages 10 to 24. Each year, over 720,000 youth are treated in emergency rooms for violence-related injuries (CDC, 2008a). These harms are particularly acute among minority youth. Improving school environments may serve as an effective preventative intervention because they are environmental anchors for youth and are part of the larger set of structural features of local environments linked to the prevalence of youth violence. Given that most individuals initiate violent behaviors during school years, schools provide a natural nexus in considering how to promote pro-social change within individuals and consequently reduce the prevalence of violence. Outside of the family, schools represent the most important institution of social control. Youth attending poorly-managed and resource-deprived schools are more likely to be exposed to violence, even after accounting for local community and family-related attributes. The concentration of youth on/around school grounds during the most crime prone times of the day, suggests that schools are natural ecological environments from which violence can generate. The proposed study will expand our understanding of the epidemiology of youth violence by analyzing the role of the school as a mediating protective factor. We theorize that improving the school environment is an important mediating factor in reducing aggregate rates of youth violence and victimization. Improving school environments can also putatively foster changing systemic aspects of communities linked to youth violence (e.g., disorder, social cohesion, collective efficacy). Given the lack of experimental evidence, we rely on natural experiments to generate exogenous variation in school environments and assess their effects on youth violence at multiple levels including state, districts, and schools. This approach is commonly used to estimate a causal impact on academic achievement, but has not been applied widely to youth violence outcomes. Our methodology relies on within-state, within-district and within- school variation via fixed effects regressions and, where relevant, instrumental variables and propensity score approaches to estimate the effects on youth violence. We will also disaggregate our estimates by race/ethnicity. The study will be among the first efforts to assess the effects of broad-based social policy efforts aimed at improving school environments on youth violence outcomes at state, district, and school levels. Through the analysis of surveillance data on youth violence and victimization outcomes collected by school districts, law enforcement, and public health departments, we can provide an epidemiological assessment of school effects on youth violence in the community. This project addresses the goals of Healthy People 2010 focus areas of Injury and Violence Prevention.

"Prime Time: Health Promotion for Multiple Risk Behaviors Prime Time: Health Promotion for Multiple Risk Behaviors is a five-year intervention research study (2005- 2009) with an overall goal to design, implement and evaluate a multi-component intervention among adolescent girls at high risk for early pregnancy that reduces multiple precursors of teen pregnancy including sexual risk taking, violence involvement, and school disconnection. Prime Time targets 13-17 year old girls (n=250) attending school and community clinics in Minneapolis/St Paul who meet specified risk criteria. Using an experimental design, half of study participants are randomly assigned to the intervention condition; half are assigned to the control condition. Intervention participants will be involved with the Prime Time intervention for an 18-month period, while control participants will continue to receive usual clinic services. Self-report data will be collected (via A-CASI surveys) from all study participants at study baseline and at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months following study enrollment. To address core risk and protective factors related to sexual risk behaviors, violence involvement, and school disconnection, the Prime Time intervention employs an innovative combination of previously-tested approaches including one-on-one case management, peer education (Just In Time) and service learning (It's Our Time) experiences. This multi-component intervention was developed and field-tested in the Prime Time pilot study. Using multi-wave data, we evaluate intervention impacts on participants' sexual risk taking and contraceptive behaviors; school connectedness, school misbehavior and school performance; violence involvement and peer-related aggression. We also test the extent to which intervention effects on outcome behaviors are mediated by hypothesized risk and protective factors targeted for change by the Prime Time intervention. If the intervention demonstrates success in preventing risk behaviors, we will actively engage in dissemination efforts to affect best practices in primary care clinics serving adolescent girls.

"New HIV Intervention Approaches for African American Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American adolescents are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (CDC, 2007a, 2007b, 2008a), highlighting the importance of further prevention research for this population. The goal of the proposed study is to address these disparities by developing and testing a new intervention approach that focuses on relationships (e.g., the different types of relationships, the context in which youth ""hook up""), as well as factors that might reduce sexual risk taking (e.g., concurrency of sexual partners, norms about the sequencing of romantic and intimate events in relationships), potentially important behavioral aims for African American youth who tend to report having more sexual partners than other racial/ethnic groups (Eaton et al., 2006). The potential effects of the intervention will be tested using a matched pilot-test design involving 2 schools (approximately 400 students), in which the schools are randomly assigned to either the intervention or comparison condition. Youth will be assessed 3 times during the study: baseline, 3 and 6 months following the intervention, providing data on sexual risk taking behaviors (e.g., sexual partners, condom use) and related determinants, such as functional knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, perceived self efficacy, and perceived norms related to relationships and sexual behaviors. The study also will yield data on characteristics of adolescents' relationships (e.g., how romantic relationships are developed, what factors characterize different types of relationships, how adolescents view the quality of their relationships). Consistent with the R21 mechanism, the study findings would yield new data on the potential promise and feasibility of a relationship-based approach to HIV prevention that could be tested in a randomized controlled trial.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American adolescents are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). More effective and accessible interventions are needed to address the HIV/STI related health disparities experienced by these youth. The proposed project has the potential to be of public health significance in the following ways: 1) it provides an additional resource for schools to address HIV/STI risk among youth, particularly African American youth; 2) if effective, a relationships-based approach to HIV would have broad appeal to schools, community-based organizations, and clinics serving adolescents because of its developmental focus; and 3) the study results could yield new insights regarding adolescents' relationships, potentially leading to promising strategies for reaching African American adolescents, an important contribution given the alarming rates of HIV and other STIs among this population group.           STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE African American adolescents are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STI).

"Correlates of Physical Activity in Adolescents with Intellectual Disabilities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regular physical activity plays an important role in health and disease prevention. Children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities (ID) have poorer health than other populations and their lack of physical activity may contribute to the health disparities that have been identified in people with disabilities. Evidence supports that children and adolescents with ID do not engage in sufficient physical activity, that their fitness is low, and that they are more sedentary than their typically developing peers. However, research on physical activity in children and adolescents with ID is limited. To inform the development of effective physical activity interventions in adolescents with ID, it is imperative to first examine their activity levels and to understand the factors associated with their participation. Physical activity is known to be influenced by many individual, psychosocial, behavioral, and environmental factors, but the factors are likely to be different in children and adolescents with ID due to their limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviors, which may limit their opportunities and abilities to participate. The specific aims of this project are: 1) to compare time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity and in structured activities between adolescents ages 13-18 with ID and typically developing adolescents; 2) to compare time spent in sedentary behavior between adolescents with ID and typically developing adolescents; and 3) to compare the individual, family, and community factors associated with physical activity and sedentary behavior between adolescents with ID and typically developing adolescents. Sixty adolescents ages 13-18 with mild ID and 60 typically developing adolescents of comparable chronological age and gender will participate in the study. Physical activity levels will be objectively measured using accelerometers over 7 consecutive days. Through questionnaires and interviews with the adolescent participants and their parents, we will gather information on demographics, adolescent and parent participation in physical activity, barriers and supports to physical activity, the importance that parents and adolescents place on physical activity, and adolescent enjoyment and self-efficacy in relation to physical activity. The health needs of children and adolescents with ID have been under-represented in research efforts, and thus, they represent an under-served minority. The proposed project seeks to address this gap by describing the physical activity patterns of adolescents with ID and comparing them to their typically developing peers. We will also identify the individual, family, and community factors associated with physical activity to determine whether they are different than those found in typically developing adolescents. This information will have direct implications for informing the development of physical activity programs specific to meeting the needs of adolescents with intellectual disabilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The US Department of Health and Human Services has identified major heath disparities in children, adolescents, and adults with intellectual disabilities (mental retardation). The poor health of this population may be caused in part by low levels of physical activity, and the government's agenda for improving health includes physical activity promotion. Physical activity is listed prominently as a leading health indicator in Healthy People 2010, and objectives include improving activity levels and reducing sedentary behavior in children. Developing effective health promotion programs for children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities requires an in-depth understanding of their physical activity levels and of the factors uniquely related to behavior.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The US Department of Health and Human Services has identified major heath disparities in children, adolescents, and adults with intellectual disabilities (mental retardation).

"Obesity in Minority Youth in Los Angeles: A Generation ""At Risk"" Overall Focus: We propose a Comprehensive NCMHD Research Center of Excellence focused on obesity in Minority Youth. This center will focus on research, translation and training to improve minority health in Hispanic and African American youth, with a major focus on exploring innovative ways to identify, prevent and reduce minority health disparities related to obesity, especially type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This center is based on the principle that obesity and associated disease risk is apparent early in life, and therefore novel interventions early in life are essential public health strategies to reduce the burden of disease-risk into adulthood. Organization: The center, with broad support from the university and its affiliate, the Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, will be led by Michael I. Goran, PhD and Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, PhD, who between them have an impressive track record in minority health research. The Administrative Core will assume leadership on all programmatic and fiscal matters and provide shared resources for data management, subject recruitment, common assays, community translation, and training and mentoring. The Research Core will provide scientific leadership and integration across three synergistic RO1-type projects that share subjects (Hispanic and African American teenagers) and methods, and have both within and between project hypotheses. Project #1 (PI: D Spruijt-Metz) will examine the hypothesis that high sugar meals contribute to fat deposition through an abnormal hormonal milieu that promotes negative moods and low physical activity levels. Project #2 (PI: V Gilsanze) will use an array of advanced imaging techniques to examine the ectopic fat hypothesis in minority adolescents by assessment of various fat depots (subcutaneous, visceral, muscle, liver and pancreas) and intima media thickness across the cascade of disease progression in minority adolescents (lean --> healthy obese --> obese with pre-diabetes --> obese with type 2 diabetes).

"Factors Associated with Teens' Non-Responsiveness to HIV Intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am committed to a career in HIV/STD prevention research. To become a fully independent investigator, I am applying for the NIMH Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) to augment my training and research in HIV/STD prevention research for vulnerable adolescents. Towards this goal, I will participate in courses, workshops, seminars, and mentoring meetings to enhance my existing knowledge and research skills, and acquire new knowledge and research skills specific to the design, implementation, adaptation and evaluation of HIV/STD prevention programs for adolescents. My proposed research plan, to be conducted at Emory University and the Fulton County Department of Health and Wellness, in Atlanta, Georgia, with the guidance of my Mentors (Primary Mentor: R. DiClemente, Co-Mentors: G. Wingood and S. Kalichman), can contribute significantly to the field of adolescent HIV prevention science in substantive and practical ways. Study 1 is a mixed-method study patterned after research conducted by my Co-Mentor (Dr. Kalichman), designed to: 1) identify the proportion of African-American female adolescents exposed to an HIV intervention that do not change their condom use, and 2) describe the personal, behavioral and psychosocial factors associated with ""failure to change"" condom use following an HIV intervention. Data from Study 1 directly informs Study 2. In Study 2, I will adapt an existing effective gender and culturally tailored adolescent HIV intervention developed by my Mentors (Dr. DiClemente, & Dr. Wingood), to enhance its efficacy for promoting condom use among African-American female adolescents who did not change their condom use after participating in an HIV intervention. The adaptation process will be guided by a sequential and systematic adaptation model, developed by Drs. Wingood and DiClemente, to facilitate the adaptation process. Study 2 is also a pilot test of the effectiveness of the adapted SiHLE intervention for this subgroup of non-responsive adolescents. The findings from the two studies in this application will make significant contributions to our understanding of adolescent sexual risk behavior and the development of effective HIV interventions which could modify the risk trajectory for HIV acquisition in hard-to-change adolescents.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV prevention interventions tailored for African-American adolescent females who are non-responsive to sexual behavior risk-reduction interventions are urgently needed as these individuals are at especially high- risk for contracting HIV/STDs. The adoption of the adapted SiHLE intervention by other health departments and community-based AIDS service organizations has the potential to reach a broad audience and a population substantially impacted by the HIV epidemic.           ",Factors Associated with Teens' Non-Responsiveness to HIV Intervention,7795876,K01MH085506,"['Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities

"CBPR to improve African American environments for youth obesity prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This U13 application responds to NICHD PAR-09-092 in the broad focus area of child, adolescent, and adult obesity. Interventions that impact upon obesity in African American children and youth, especially females, are critically needed given the steeper than average trajectory of increase and high obesity prevalence in African American children and youth, especially females. The domain of obesity research is defined here to include determinants of food, physical activity, and weight control at both environmental and individual levels and their relationships to obesity and related morbidity and mortality. This broad domain has intrinsic connections to a spectrum of potential community issues and priorities. Activities will be designed to identify the community's perceived areas of interest for addressing disparities related to obesity, with a particular focus on youth engagement. These activities will be undertaken under the rubric of the African American Collaborative Obesity Research Network (AACORN), a national organization based at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. Funds requested in this application would support engagement of youth and adult community members in planning and implementing two community-focused, national workshops, in 2010 and 2012, reflecting community priorities for social change activities related to childhood obesity prevention. Specific aims are to: 1) Implement creative new methods of enabling youth partners to share their perspectives, become more informed, and identify priorities about issues related to eating, physical activity, and body weight; 2) Create an advisory board that will stimulate dialogue among youth and adult community members and academic researchers about issues and priorities in these focus areas; 3)Identify and engage, through a memorandum of understanding, at least one youth focused, community organization as a community based participatory research (CBPR) partner; 4) With community partners and the advisory board, plan and implement a specific component of AACORN's 2010 and 2012 workshops that will provide for conjoint community and academic researcher capacity building and establish a foundation for planning longer term cross-learning and CBPR activities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need to increase the direct involvement of African American community members and organizations in the generation of endogenous solutions to obesity and related health and quality of life issues is great.

"Urethral Microbiome of Adolescent Males    DESCRIPTION: The microflora of the anterior male urethra during adolescence is poorly described and no data address the range of ""typical"" urethral microflora during adolescence as functions of pubertal development or onset of various types of partnered sexual activity. This means that current understanding of the urethral microbiome in adolescent men rests entirely on data drawn from adults, and from epidemiologic and behavioral explanations. Marked ethnic group variation in adolescent sexual behaviors and disparity in conditions such as sexually transmitted infections (STI) justifies exploration of potential ethnic group differences in the male urethral microflora. Some research among adult males suggests important interactions between the male urethral microflora and STI, but this research has not been extended to younger men. Here we propose to characterize the male urethral microbiome in longitudinal urine samples collected from a multi-ethnic cohort of adolescent males. Microbial flora will be assessed as function of pubertal development, sexual activity, and incident STI. Subjects will be Latino (N=24), African-American (N=24), and Euro-American (N=24) males, ages 14 - 17 at enrollment; total N=72). Participants will be recruited from an urban clinic within an area of high prevalence of STI. Socio-demographic data will be collected at enrollment. Daily behavioral and symptomologic data will be collected via cell phone, which will also be used for cohort maintenance and scheduling of sample collections. Urine will be collected at enrollment and up to 36 1-month follow-up samples for characterization of microflora using high-throughput 16S rRNA phylogeny, Q-PCR and   metagenomic sequencing. STI testing will be done as well to better understand interactions between the urethral microbiome and infection. Cell phones also will be used to initiate daily sample collection for 10 days following trigger events such as specific sexual acts, antibiotic use, condom failure, or genital symptoms. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project is designed to describe the range of the normal microbiome of adolescent males, to describe the changes associated with puberty and to link the microbiome to potential health conditions such as sexually transmitted infections.             The project is designed to describe the range of the normal microbiome of adolescent males, to describe the changes associated with puberty and to link the microbiome to potential health conditions such as sexually transmitted infections.",Urethral Microbiome of Adolescent Males,8117351,UH3AI094641,"['failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Phylogeny ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' human puberty ', ' Puberty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' rRNA ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' urethral ', ' Urethra ', ' Urethritis ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' Male Urethra ', ' Male urethral structure ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' urogenital system (genital part) ', ' Genital ', ' Genital system ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Normal Values ', ' Normal Range ', ' Schedule ', ' Sampling ', ' Circumcision ', ' Male Circumcision ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' microbial community ', ' metagenome sequencing ', ' metagenomic sequencing ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Address ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' microbiome ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Infection ', ' ']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,UH3,2010,1530436,0.030581723146327556
"Mexican-origin Teen Moms, Their Infants, and Mother Figures: Health & Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will examine how developmental, family, cultural, and economic factors interact to inform the health and development of two groups of children who are disproportionately at risk for negative health outcomes:  Mexican-origin adolescent mothers and their young children. Adolescent females of Mexican origin have the highest national birthrate, and it is over twice the overall national rate (National Vital Statistics Report, 2005).  Because children of adolescent mothers are at increased risk for negative outcomes (Chandra, Schivello, Ravi, Weinstein, & Hook, 2002) and adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning has been identified as a predictor of children's health and development (Carothers, Borkowski, Lefever, & Whitman, 2005), it is critical to examine the factors that inform adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning, their parenting behaviors, and in turn, their children's health and development. We propose to build on our study of Mexican-origin adolescent mothers, their mothers or mother figures (referred to in our study as the female family member; FFM), and their infants, which involved data gathered from adolescents and FFMs during the adolescents' third trimester of pregnancy (Wave 1), and from adolescent mothers, FFMs, and infants when infants were 10 months of age (Wave 2) and again when infants were 24 months of age (Wave 3). We propose to collect three additional points of measurement from all three family members in the 206 families who participated in the original project (N = 618).  This longitudinal, multi-generational study will capture cultural, family, and developmental processes and outcomes for a) adolescent mothers and FFMs over a five-year period beginning when adolescent mothers are in middle/late adolescence (i.e., 15-18 years of age) through emerging adulthood (20-23 years of age), and b) their young children from infancy (i.e., 10 months) through early childhood (i.e., 5 yrs of age). Specific aims are  to examine (1) the linkages between trajectories of two normative developmental processes (i.e., ethnic identity,  autonomy) and trajectories of Mexican-origin adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning (e.g., depressive  symptoms) from middle/late adolescence through emerging adulthood, and to identify family, peer, and cultural  characteristics that moderate these associations; (2) how family (i.e., mother-adolescent conflict), economic  (i.e., economic hardship), and cultural (i.e., acculturative stress and discrimination) stressors are linked to  adolescent mothers' trajectories of psychosocial functioning, and to investigate the family, peer, and cultural  characteristics that moderate these associations; and (3) how trajectories of adolescent mothers' psychosocial  functioning predict their parenting behaviors and, in turn, trajectories of their children's health and development;  we also will test family, peer, and cultural characteristics that moderate these associations. A focus on Mexican-  origin children is critical because Latinos (of which Mexican-origin are a majority) are repeatedly identified as an  at-risk population for negative health and behavioral outcomes and, in fact, show substantial risk for  maladjustment in almost all leading health indicators identified by Healthy People 2010 (CDC, 2008).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latinos show greater risk for maladjustment in almost all of the leading health indicators identified by Healthy  People 2010 (CDC, 2008) and bear a disproportionate burden of disease, injury, death, and disability in the  U.S. (CDC, 2004a). Furthermore, Mexican-origin adolescent females lead the nation in rates of teen pregnancy (with rates over twice the national average; National Vital Statistics Report, 2005). This research will contribute significantly to understanding how to promote positive health and development among Mexican-origin adolescent mothers and their young children, which is in line with the Surgeon General's call to address health disparities among Latinos and other ethnic minorities (U.S. Surgeon General, 2008).          Project Narrative  Latinos show greater risk for maladjustment in almost all of the leading health indicators identified by Healthy  People 2010 (CDC, 2008) and bear a disproportionate burden of disease, injury, death, and disability in the  U.S. (CDC, 2004a).

"DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A JAMAICAN MOTHER-DAUGHTER HIV RISK-REDUCTION PROGRAM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Caribbean nations, including Jamaica, exhibit HIV rates that are second only to sub-Saharan Africa. Jamaican young women and adolescent girls are at particularly high risk due to a number of cultural factors, gender norms, partnering with older male partners, and lack of knowledge and skills related to sexual refusal and HIV prevention. U.S. studies have shown that mothers may act as a key influence of their daughters' sexual risk beliefs and behaviors. However, no studies have documented these effects outside of the U.S. and no studies have evaluated HIV risk-reduction interventions with Jamaican adolescent girls and their mothers. Hence, the purpose of the proposed project is to partner with the University of the West Indies, Jamaican community based organizations (CBOs) and families in order to develop and test a culture-specific mother-daughter HIV risk-reduction intervention in a randomized pilot field experiment. Specifically, we propose to test whether a culture-specific, theory-based, skill-building intervention with Jamaican adolescent girls and their mothers can directly and/or indirectly reduce these girls' HIV risk-associated sexual behaviors. Jamaican girls, ages 14-18, and their mothers/female guardians will be recruited from CBOs and randomly assigned to either: (a) a mother-daughter HIV risk-reduction intervention condition or (b) a ""no intervention"" control condition. The HIV risk-reduction intervention includes 8 modules scheduled over 2 days and implemented by trained adult Jamaican women recruited from among CBO staff. The mother component is designed to increase parenting behaviors (e.g., parental monitoring, parent-child sexual communication [PCSC]) associated with reduced adolescent sexual risk-taking; the teen component is designed to improve girls' beliefs and skills related to abstinence, sexual negotiation and condom use. A ""no intervention"" control condition is being employed as the proposed project is a pilot study of the HIV risk-reduction intervention. Primary outcomes include mothers'/daughters' reports of parenting behaviors and daughters' self-reports of sexual risk behaviors (sexual intercourse, unprotected sex, condom use, number of partners). Secondary outcomes include mothers' beliefs regarding parenting behaviors and daughters beliefs regarding sexual risk behaviors-the theoretical mediators of intervention effects. Findings from this study will contribute to the development of effective HIV risk-reduction programs for Jamaican adolescent girls and young women.             ",DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A JAMAICAN MOTHER-DAUGHTER HIV RISK-REDUCTION PROGRAM,7874612,R01NR010478,"['Daughter ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' International ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Incidence ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Jamaica ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Parents ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Planning Theory ', ' instrument ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Abstinence ', ' sex abstinence ', ' not sexually active ', ' celibate ', ' abstaining from sex ', ' abstain from sexual intercouse ', ' abstain from sexual activity ', ' abstain from intercouse ', ' Celibacy ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' West Indies ', ' Caribbean Islands ', ' Woman ', ' Wood material ', ' Wood ', ' Work ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' interest ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' intervention program ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' parental monitoring ', ' parent monitoring ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Schedule ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' community organizations ', ' safer sex ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NINR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,543626,0.03319733899408491
"Pathways to overweight and pubertal timing in African-American and White girls    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Health disparities between African-American and white girls are evident early in life and continue over the life course. In adulthood, African-American females bear a disproportionate burden of poor health, give birth to sicker babies, and die at younger ages than white females. The persistence and depth of these disparities is recognized as a major public health problem and the elimination of these health disparities has been identified as one of the two major goals of the decade within Healthy People 2010. Despite the high national priority given to eliminating health disparities, progress towards this goal has been slow. Research has focused primarily on understanding the extent and depth of the problem and in establishing links between broad measures of social and economic factors and health disparities. Much of the research has used cross- sectional data--a design that cannot adequately examine associations between a health outcome and risk exposures that temporally preceded the observation window. Despite rapid developments in the biological sciences suggesting strong influences of early life exposures on the shaping of biological processes, few studies have investigated health disparities in light of early childhood contextual experiences. In this study, we investigate the impact of early childhood contexts on adolescent physical health using the Life Course Health Development Theory which posits that health variability is tied to the interaction of multiple contextual factors at sensitive life periods and that extraorganismic influences ""get under one's skin"" through biological processes designed to adapt to acute stress. In this theory the early contextual period starts with the mother's prepregnancy health and continues through the intrauterine and early childhood years. This is the time period that is the focus of our study. We will examine early childhood contextual factors from 4 domains using a multigenerational data base (NLSY79 Mother, Child, and Young Adult files) that has great strength in the depth and richness of contextual variables. We will examine how these contextual factors differentially impact the physical health (somatic growth, age of menarche, and self-reported general health status) of African-American and white girls in adolescence. The overall aim of this project is to determine how early life contexts differentially influence the physical health of African-American and white adolescent girls. The specific aims are: 1)To quantify and describe race differences in early childhood environmental contexts; 2)To test whether there are racial disparities in adolescent physical health in African-American and white girls matched on early childhood contextual factors. 3) To model race differences in adolescent physical health as a function of the early childhood environment and to investigate the extent to which race differences in adolescent physical health are attributable to: a) Differences in the level of available resources within contexts key to young children, b) Differences in children's health response to early environmental contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major thrust of this proposal is to understand how early childhood environments differentially influence the health of white and African-American adolescent females. The knowledge gained from this research will aid with the development of prevention and/or early intervention strategies aimed at improving the health of African-American females.

"Perinatal Loss and Bereavement in Non-Hispanic Black Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in infant mortality rates exist between white and non-Hispanic black females despite improved access to prenatal care. In 2004 the preterm related infant mortality rate for non-Hispanic black women was 3.5 times higher than for white women. Adolescent females are among those with the highest rates of perinatal loss. Perinatal loss includes miscarriages, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths within the first 28 days of life. Pregnancy loss in adolescents has been linked to an increase in depressive symptoms as well as significant emotional, physical, social and cognitive grief responses. There is evidence that low socio-economic status and developmental factors are markers that increase the risk for complicated grieving. There are few published studies that describe the perinatal bereavement experience in black women, thus, very little is known about the experience of perinatal loss and the subsequent bereavement support needs in non-Hispanic black adolescents. This paucity of research has created a gap in knowledge for nurses who desire to offer culturally sensitive, evidence-based support to help young black women cope with bereavement following the loss of an infant. The overarching goal of this study is to build an understanding of the experience of perinatal bereavement in non-Hispanic black adolescent females. The specific aims are: 1) to generate a disclosive theory that describes the experience of perinatal bereavement in non-Hispanic black female adolescents; 2) to identify critical transitions in the perinatal bereavement process that may signal a need for culturally sensitive bereavement support services. This study is aligned with the NINR's strategic objectives to improve the quality of life, to eliminate health disparities, and to improve care at the end of life across all age spans. A qualitative research design using grounded theory methods is proposed. Unmarried, non-Hispanic black females, aged 16-18 years who have experienced a perinatal loss by stillbirth or neonatal death (first 28 days of life) will be interviewed at three points in time over a period of three months. Constant comparative data analysis will be used.       Relevance to public health: There is a high rate of infant mortality in non-Hispanic black females; hence there is an urgent need to study the phenomenon of perinatal bereavement in black adolescents. This study is important because it will inform nurses about the perinatal loss and bereavement experience of non-Hispanic black adolescent females. Understanding critical transitions in the bereavement process may provide nurses the opportunity to offer culturally sensitive perinatal bereavement support. This study will be foundational to direct future studies to build and test bereavement support interventions.           ",Perinatal Loss and Bereavement in Non-Hispanic Black Adolescents,7920203,F31NR010816,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Caring ', ' Improve Access ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' Perinatal ', ' Goals ', ' Grief reaction ', ' Grief ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Postneonatal Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Nurses ', ' Prenatal care ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' neonatal death ', ' neonatal demise ', ' Woman ', ' Bereavement ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Stillbirth ', ' experience ', ' Pregnancy loss ', ' social ', ' Spontaneous abortion ', ' Miscarriage ', ' Emotional ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' response ', ' Unmarried ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' coping ', ' aged ', ' comparative ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NINR,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,F31,2010,14121,0.06710481397641437

"Biopsychosocial Determinants of Adolescent Obesity/Cardiovascular Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of adolescent obesity is high in the U.S., and in Latin America. While dramatic environmental changes in the food and physical environment are associated with increased risk, there continues to be inadequate understanding of the individual, family and community level factors that protect against the development of obesity. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms leading to disparate risk for obesity in low-income and Hispanic/Latino youth. The proposed 5-year project aims to elucidate interconnected biological and social pathways associated with adolescent obesity and risk for later development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This application involves approximately 620 Chilean adolescents, assessed in infancy, 3 to 5 years and 10 years as part of a NIH-supported cohort study of the behavioral and developmental effects of preventing iron deficiency anemia in infancy (n = 1645). As such, detailed longitudinal data related to growth, health and development have been collected. At 16 to 17 years, the youth will participate in study of activity, sleep and eating patterns using actigraphic recording and laboratory assessment of eating behavior. In addition, we will measure anthropometry, fat and muscle mass (DXA), fasting glucose, insulin (HOMA IR), lipids, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, orexin, CRP, and TNF alpha. Detailed information about family history, smoking, health, and psychosocial functioning will also be collected. Neighborhood level factors such as crime, walk ability and resources for physical activity and healthful food attributes will be assessed. Furthermore, a sizeable subset (n = 237) with sleep neurophysiology and actigraphic recordings at multiple time points will participate in 2-night polysmnographic sleep study at 16 years.    Guided by a life-course approach, we propose to investigate three Specific Aims:    Specific Aim 1 - To evaluate biological and psychosocial determinants of obesity and related metabolic disturbance in a cohort of adolescents followed since early infancy.    Specific Aim 2  - To assess associations between obesity/adiposity and biomarkers of adiposity-related metabolic disturbance in this sample of Chilean adolescents.    Specific Aim 3 - To assess the role of circadian patterns of physical activity, sleep and eating behavior on adiposity and related metabolic disturbance.    The long standing collaboration between the Institute for Nutrition and Technology at the University of Chile and the Center for Human Growth and Development at the University of Michigan provides an outstanding environment to study biological and psychosocial determinants of adolescent obesity in a low- to middle-income cohort of Latin American youth who are very similar in obesity risk to comparable U.S. youth. We expect to advance understanding of how developmental patterns of eating and activity are influenced by early life factors and in turn influence the development of obesity and related metabolic disturbance. Our study is unique in the depth and breadth of longitudinal psychosocial and biological data. We propose research that crosses disciplinary boundaries and has the potential to reveal important determinants of adolescent obesity for future intervention research. PUBLIC HEATLH RELEVANCE: Adolescent obesity develops during childhood in response to biological factors and social conditions. While biological factors such as genetic inheritance are difficult to change, social factors could be targets for preventive efforts. We expect to further understanding of the environmental and social conditions related to the development of obesity in a high risk urban, Hispanic/Latino population. We are interested in how children develop circadian rhythms related to eating, sleeping and activity, and subsequently how these patterns lead to obesity. Our goal is to unveil modifiable conditions in order to prevent obesity and related diseases including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.          ",Biopsychosocial Determinants of Adolescent

"School Environment as a Mechanism to Reduce Youth Violence and Victimization    Description (Provided by Applicant): Youth violence imposes enormous costs on individuals and society. Youth violence is the second leading cause of death among individuals ages 10 to 24. Each year, over 720,000 youth are treated in emergency rooms for violence-related injuries (CDC, 2008a). These harms are particularly acute among minority youth. Improving school environments may serve as an effective preventative intervention because they are environmental anchors for youth and are part of the larger set of structural features of local environments linked to the prevalence of youth violence. Given that most individuals initiate violent behaviors during school years, schools provide a natural nexus in considering how to promote pro-social change within individuals and consequently reduce the prevalence of violence. Outside of the family, schools represent the most important institution of social control. Youth attending poorly-managed and resource-deprived schools are more likely to be exposed to violence, even after accounting for local community and family-related attributes. The concentration of youth on/around school grounds during the most crime prone times of the day, suggests that schools are natural ecological environments from which violence can generate. The proposed study will expand our understanding of the epidemiology of youth violence by analyzing the role of the school as a mediating protective factor. We theorize that improving the school environment is an important mediating factor in reducing aggregate rates of youth violence and victimization. Improving school environments can also putatively foster changing systemic aspects of communities linked to youth violence (e.g., disorder, social cohesion, collective efficacy). Given the lack of experimental evidence, we rely on natural experiments to generate exogenous variation in school environments and assess their effects on youth violence at multiple levels including state, districts, and schools. This approach is commonly used to estimate a causal impact on academic achievement, but has not been applied widely to youth violence outcomes. Our methodology relies on within-state, within-district and within- school variation via fixed effects regressions and, where relevant, instrumental variables and propensity score approaches to estimate the effects on youth violence. We will also disaggregate our estimates by race/ethnicity. The study will be among the first efforts to assess the effects of broad-based social policy efforts aimed at improving school environments on youth violence outcomes at state, district, and school levels. Through the analysis of surveillance data on youth violence and victimization outcomes collected by school districts, law enforcement, and public health departments, we can provide an epidemiological assessment of school effects on youth violence in the community. This project addresses the goals of Healthy People 2010 focus areas of Injury and Violence Prevention. Youth violence imposes enormous costs on individuals and society and its harms are particularly acute among minority populations. The proposed study will expand our understanding of the epidemiology of youth violence by analyzing the role of the school as a mediating protective factor in reducing these harms.

"AMICA: Assessing Fit of Motivational Interviewing by Cultures with Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic adolescents experience more severe alcohol-related consequences due to their alcohol abuse and yet significantly fewer Hispanic adolescents receive alcohol treatment, particularly among justice-involved youth. Despite the level of research that has been conducted on motivational interviewing (MI) with mainstream samples, no published studies have investigated the efficacy of this brief, individual intervention with Hispanic adolescents. The overarching objective of this application is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief individual intervention (MI) for problem drinking behaviors with a sample of justice-involved Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents to determine if this intervention is differentially effective between Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents. Specifically, the first aim is to determine whether an MI intervention targeting alcohol abuse is effective at reducing alcohol use and related risk behavior in a sample of adolescent alcohol abusers. The second aim is to examine whether the effects of MI on problem drinking outcomes (e.g., alcohol problems, quantity of drinking, frequency of binging) are different between Hispanic versus Caucasian adolescents. Because it is important to determine the mechanisms that mediate the effects of MI and determine whether these mechanisms differ between Caucasian and Hispanic adolescents, the third aim is to examine whether group (Hispanic vs. Caucasian) moderates the meditational linkages in the overall model using a cross-groups approach to moderated mediation (Aiken, Stein, & Bentler, 1994; Bentler, 1995). To accomplish these aims, 453 Caucasian and Hispanic justice-involved alcohol abusing adolescents (ages 14-17) will be randomized to either two 60 minute MI interventions (one at baseline and a second, one week later) or an assessment only control condition (AO). All adolescents will receive behavioral assessments at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. The proposed research is expected to take a significant step towards reducing current racial/ethnic health disparities in alcohol treatment for Hispanic adolescents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the advances made in developing efficacious brief alcohol abuse interventions for mainstream adolescents, no studies have evaluated the efficacy of brief (2 session) individual alcohol abuse interventions for Hispanic adolescents. In the face of their higher need, but lower likelihood of receiving effective alcohol interventions, this research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a brief intervention, motivational interviewing (MI), with Hispanic adolescents. This research will also identify potential culturally-specific moderators in problem drinking outcomes following this brief intervention. This research will take a significant step towards reducing current racial/ethnic health disparities and improving alcohol treatment for Hispanic adolescents.           Despite the advances made in developing efficacious brief alcohol abuse interventions for mainstream adolescents, no studies have evaluated the efficacy of brief (2 session) individual alcohol abuse interventions for Hispanic adolescents.

"The Effects of Prenatal Cocaine Exposure in Adolescence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a continuation of grant R01 DA07957 ""The Effects of Prenatal Cocaine Exposure at School Age,"" a longitudinal study of the prenatal effects of cocaine/polydrug exposure (n=382; 194 cocaine-exposed and 188 non-cocaine-exposed). This study, as well as others, has found differences among prenatally cocaine- exposed children that include deficits in perceptual reasoning, attention, language development and externalizing behavior problems compared to non-exposed children. The effects of environmental lead exposure and the differential impact of caregiver placement have been identified as important determinants of early developmental outcomes in this cohort, indicating the need for continued study at this developmental stage of newly emerging risk behaviors and social stress. We propose following this large cohort from age 15 through 18 years with the overarching objective of determining whether the negative effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on brain development continue to interfere with optimal developmental outcomes, and if cocaine exposure is associated with increased incidence of risky behavior, particularly substance misuse and mental health problems. Adolescents will be assessed using self and caregiver report, interview, bioassay and standardized assessments. Specific aims are to: assess the relationship of prenatal cocaine exposure to cognitive and behavioral outcomes (risk taking and mental health problems) in adolescence and to assess lead levels, iron deficiency, caregiving and environmental correlates of exposure; explore models that assess the relationship of early cognitive deficits and behavior problems to risk taking behaviors in an adolescent high-risk cocaine/polydrug exposed cohort; assess parenting experiences and behaviors of caregivers of cocaine- exposed and non-exposed adolescents; and assess the direct and indirect relationships of prenatal cocaine exposure to adolescent behavioral outcomes. Our model focuses on the mediating effects of earlier deficits in cognitive performance, attention and inhibitory control on risk taking behavior and the moderating effects of gender. Effects of lead exposure, iron deficiency and caregiving environment will be explored using structural equation modeling (SEM) and path modeling. The results of this study will provide the basis for designing culturally sensitive interventions prenatally or early in life that could reduce risky teen behaviors and ultimately reduce serious lifelong health problems including substance dependence, trauma and HIV infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A pattern of attention, behavioral regulation and cognitive problems among prenatally cocaine-exposed infants and children has been identified by this research group as well as others. Results indicate that fetal exposure to cocaine may have specific effects on brain development that can be observed in early cognitive and behavioral outcomes and that outcomes are also influenced by level of environmental lead exposure and caregiving quality. This study hypothesizes that the pattern of deficits found in childhood may translate into greater risk taking behavior including substance misuse and mental health problems in adolescence that can have grave consequences on adult productivity and health. Further research on prenatally cocaine-exposed adolescents will identify key points for the timing and focus of intervention and provide important content for public health messages.           7.

"Partner Age Discordance and HIV Risk Behaviors in Adolescent Girls (Sexual RP)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent girls in violent or controlling relationships are likely to be at higher risk for HIV and STIs. Their risk of relationship violence or power imbalances may be greater when the partner is two or more years older. The purpose of this study is to test a proposed model of the correlations between sexual relationship power and intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV risk related sexual behaviors in a sample of at-risk adolescent girls. The model is derived from Blanc's evidence-based framework for assessing the relationship between gender power relations and reproductive health in populations as risk for power imbalances. Specifically, the study aims to investigate the relationship of sexual partners' age discordance of more than two years to high-risk sexual behavior, in adolescent girls ages 14-18, as well as the mediating role of sexual relationship power and IPV in that relationship. A cross-sectional, descriptive, survey design will be used to evaluate the model of Proposed Predictors of Sexual Risk in Adolescent Girls. Data will be collected from 150 sexually active adolescent girls at an urban school-based health center, in a low-income neighborhood. Data collection will be done via a self-administered, computer-assisted survey, Promote Health, which will analyze responses and format a report with health information, referrals, and resources specific to the individual participant. Data will be analyzed for main effects of demographic variables, including age of adolescent girl, race/ethnicity and acculturation status, and history of physical or sexual abuse. If main effects are determined, then these factors will be controlled for in regression analysis. The role of sexual relationship power and IPV as mediators of the relationship among partner age discordance and high risk sexual behaviors will be determined through multiple regression analysis. Sub-analyses will be conducted to further investigate the correlations among variables, for example sexual relationship power and IPV. The proposed research questions are critical in addressing the needs for early intervention in HIV/STD prevention for adolescent girls, who are at high risk for IPV and one of the fastest growing groups infected with HIV and other STIs. Understanding the prevalence and effects of power imbalances in romantic relationships is essential in developing strategies to reduce HIV, other STIs, and IPV. If relationship factors, such as age discordance, relative power, and violence increase the likelihood of sexual risk behaviors in at-risk adolescent girls, this knowledge can be used to shape questions asked in clinical risk assessment, and to develop prevention interventions and public health policy.          ",Partner Age Discordance and HIV Risk Behaviors in Adolescent Girls (Sexual RP),7714365,F31MH082646,"['Data Collection ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Laws ', ' statutory rape ', ' sexual relationship ', ' Individual ', ' sexually active ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' sex abuse ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rosa ', ' Rose ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Behavior ', ' age group ', ' Participant ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' community intervention ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' relationship violence ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,F31,2010,6885,0.05753459052159543
"Correlates of Physical Activity in Adolescents with Intellectual Disabilities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regular physical activity plays an important role in health and disease prevention. Children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities (ID) have poorer health than other populations and their lack of physical activity may contribute to the health disparities that have been identified in people with disabilities. Evidence supports that children and adolescents with ID do not engage in sufficient physical activity, that their fitness is low, and that they are more sedentary than their typically developing peers. However, research on physical activity in children and adolescents with ID is limited. To inform the development of effective physical activity interventions in adolescents with ID, it is imperative to first examine their activity levels and to understand the factors associated with their participation. Physical activity is known to be influenced by many individual, psychosocial, behavioral, and environmental factors, but the factors are likely to be different in children and adolescents with ID due to their limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviors, which may limit their opportunities and abilities to participate. The specific aims of this project are: 1) to compare time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity and in structured activities between adolescents ages 13-18 with ID and typically developing adolescents; 2) to compare time spent in sedentary behavior between adolescents with ID and typically developing adolescents; and 3) to compare the individual, family, and community factors associated with physical activity and sedentary behavior between adolescents with ID and typically developing adolescents. Sixty adolescents ages 13-18 with mild ID and 60 typically developing adolescents of comparable chronological age and gender will participate in the study. Physical activity levels will be objectively measured using accelerometers over 7 consecutive days. Through questionnaires and interviews with the adolescent participants and their parents, we will gather information on demographics, adolescent and parent participation in physical activity, barriers and supports to physical activity, the importance that parents and adolescents place on physical activity, and adolescent enjoyment and self-efficacy in relation to physical activity. The health needs of children and adolescents with ID have been under-represented in research efforts, and thus, they represent an under-served minority. The proposed project seeks to address this gap by describing the physical activity patterns of adolescents with ID and comparing them to their typically developing peers. We will also identify the individual, family, and community factors associated with physical activity to determine whether they are different than those found in typically developing adolescents. This information will have direct implications for informing the development of physical activity programs specific to meeting the needs of adolescents with intellectual disabilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The US Department of Health and Human Services has identified major heath disparities in children, adolescents, and adults with intellectual disabilities (mental retardation). The poor health of this population may be caused in part by low levels of physical activity, and the government's agenda for improving health includes physical activity promotion. Physical activity is listed prominently as a leading health indicator in Healthy People 2010, and objectives include improving activity levels and reducing sedentary behavior in children. Developing effective health promotion programs for children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities requires an in-depth understanding of their physical activity levels and of the factors uniquely related to behavior.

"Family Obligation and Assistance Among Adolescents with Mexican Backgrounds Families with Latino backgrounds now represent the largest ethnic minority group in the United States, and adolescents wtihin the$8 families face substantial challenges to their psychological and behavioral adjustment. Emerging evidence indicates that traditional family values and practices may play a critical role in shaping Latino adolescents' risk for a number of problematic outcomes, including externalizing behavior problems, substance use, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and school disengagement and dropout. Family obligation and assistance have been identified as key elements of famHy relationships among famUies with Mexican baCkgrounds, the single largest LaUno ethnic group. Family obligation and assistance also have been shown to be Significant predictOf""S of adolescents' adjustment, induding their involvement in substarx:e use and theil"" psychological well being. But ills stlD unclear 'Nhich facets of family obligation and assistance are sources of strength and which are challenges for the adolescents' adjustment. Withoutltlis information, it Is difficult to develop meaningful programs and policies that focus on this growing population of adolescents. The proposed research study fills th is gap in prior research by taking an approach that family membership functions as a social identity for adolescents from Mexican backgrounds, and uses several prInciples of Social Identity Tl1eory in order to address four kay questions: (1) How ara family obligation and assistance socialized within families from Mexican backgrounds?: (2) How does actuallamily assistan~ depend upon the families' daily needs and routines?; (3) How does lamily obligation and assistance impact adolescents' emotional and behavioral adjustment?; and (4) How do the dynamics of family obligation and assistance vary aCCOl""ding 10 characteristics of the adolescents' themselves? The proposed stud~' will address these key questions employing mixed methods, including traditional quantitative interviews, daily diary checktists, and qualitative IntervieWS. The study will take place in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, a primary location of families wilh Mexican backgrounds in the United Slates.

"Symptom Severity, Treatment Engagement, and Outcomes for Culturally Diverse Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this research proposal is to investigate the patterns and roles of symptom severity and service engagement in community-based mental health services for diverse adolescent populations. Researchers and policy-makers have highlighted the need for a better understanding of the various factors contributing to issues related to mental health service utilization, engagement, and outcomes for ethnic minorities. Unfortunately, empirical research regarding these factors remains sparse. This research proposal addresses gaps in the literature by: 1) Examining the relationship between race/ethnicity and acculturation to symptom severity at treatment entry for a diverse adolescent sample, 2) Examining the relationship between symptom severity and treatment outcomes for a diverse adolescent sample, and 3)   Examining the role of treatment engagement in treatment outcomes for a diverse adolescent sample. The sample will consist of 260 adolescents (aged 12-19) who have received school and clinic-based mental health services, their parents, and their therapists. Secondary data analysis will be based on data collection from a baseline interview and four follow-up interviews over the course of 12 months. Research instruments measure symptom severity, engagement in treatment, sociodemographics, and treatment outcomes. Analysis will involve descriptive statistics, multiple regression models, and moderation and mediation effects on these models/equations.   Findings from this research proposal have potentially significant implications for improving the delivery and quality of care for ethnic minority adolescents.

"Community Violence Exposure and Positive Youth Development in Urban Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescents in urban environments are exposed to staggering proportions of community violence which affects their physical and emotional well-being. Consequences of community violence exposure include depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress and aggression, and likely add to health disparities. Research shows that posttraumatic stress may mediate the relationship between community violence exposure and negative mental health outcomes. Posttraumatic stress responses can be considered both normative and pathological, and this duality makes the potential role of posttraumatic stress as a mediator between community violence exposure and outcomes intriguing. If young people are the future of society, exposure to community violence and its ramifications is unacceptable and demands innovative solutions. This proposed study will focus on positive youth development in the context of community violence. The positive youth development perspective can help to inform the design of future interventions that enhance the development of potentially vulnerable and often marginalized youth. Positive youth development expands knowledge beyond the absence of problem behaviors or pathology, to the presence of healthy development.      The goal of this training plan is to gain a better understanding of the relationship between community violence exposure, posttraumatic stress and positive youth development in urban adolescents. The purpose of this proposed study is to use a quantitative cross-sectional research design to specifically examine the effects of posttraumatic stress in the relationship between community violence exposure and positive youth development in 110 community-dwelling urban adolescents, ages 13-17. The specific aims of this study are to: 1). Describe the level of community violence exposure, posttraumatic stress, and indicators of positive youth development among urban adolescents: 2). Examine the relationships between community violence exposure, posttraumatic stress, and positive youth development: and 3.) Explore the combined effects of community violence exposure and posttraumatic stress on positive youth development.      This proposal addresses community violence exposure, a known public health problem for urban youth. Research conducted through this fellowship will include collection of data from community-dwelling adolescents in order to gain an understanding of the impact of community violence exposure on positive youth development in urban adolescents.

"""Development and Crash Injury Risk in Adolescent Latino Males""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unintentional injury remains the leading cause of death in children over age one. This is no different for children entering and traversing the adolescent period of life (age 10 - age 18). While adolescence has been described as a development period of strength and resilience, experts have highlighted the dual paradox that exists during this time of life. This dual paradox describes adolescence as a time of increased injury-related morbidity and mortality rates despite it also being a time of acquiring greater physical strength and capacity for decision-making. Because of their higher than expected mortality rate as they navigate the adolescent and emerging adult period of life, Latino adolescent males have been identified as the anomaly to the Latino Epidemiological Paradox. Cause of death during this time is largely attributed to motor vehicle crashes. The research proposed in this application will explore adolescent developmental sources of crash risk in the context of Latino and youth culture. The first component of this research program will involve analysis of data sets from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. It will provide longitudinal information on adolescent friend influence on risky driving behavior in the general population. The second component will involve comprehensive in-depth interviews of Latino adolescent males in order gain greater insight into Latino and youth culture and risky driving behavior. The last research component will utilize survey and diaries methodologies to elucidate the social context of risky driving in Latino adolescents and how this changes over the adolescent and emerging adult periods of life.  Successfully completing this training and research, the applicant will acquire a skill set needed to become an independent clinical investigator. Furthermore, the information gained will lead to broader understanding of injury disparity in Latino adolescent males and be applied to future development of a clinical contact injury prevention intervention.         ","""Development and Crash Injury Risk in Adolescent Latino Males""",7677907,K23HD050630,"['Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' injury prevention ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Future ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' Health ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Investigation ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' skills ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Friends ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Latino ', ' driving behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' injured ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' decision-making capacity ', ' ']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2010,125679,0.05304398261450578
"HIV Prevention and Partner Abuse: Developing an Intervention for Adolescent Girls    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This K01 Career Development Award proposes to establish a rigorous academic foundation for a research career devoted to developing and testing novel interventions for reducing HIV risk for adolescents. Thematically, the K01 will address the social context of HIV risk by integrating effective theory-based adolescent HIV prevention with promising partner abuse prevention strategies, emphasizing promotion of healthy relationships. It uses family planning clinics as a venue for providing a skill-based, culturally-tailored HIV and partner abuse prevention educational and advocacy program for African American girls living is economically disadvantaged circumstances. Partner abuse, which significantly increases risk for HIV, disproportionately affects low income African-American adolescent girls, as does HIV. Critical to this project is the candidate's demonstrated ability to conduct HIV/STD research in partnership with minority communities, a long term engagement in interdisciplinary scholarship aimed at improving health and a 20- year history as a primary care provider. However, to meet her long term career objective she requires additional instruction and mentorship in 6 key areas: 1) Methods for developing theory-driven, culture- specific, developmental^ appropriate curricula in HIV prevention intervention; 2) Design and evaluation of RCT prevention programs with specific considerations for reducing HIV risk associated with partner violence among adolescent girls; 3) Advanced skills in statistical analysis, particularly techniques relevant to intervention research; 4) Study in HIV and intimate partner violence among adolescents, with special attention to racial, economic and gender disparities; 5) Responsible conduct of research with particular attention to legal and ethical considerations for adolescent HIV and partner abuse issues; 6) Manuscript preparation skills. The research plan is divided into two phases, both guided by social cognitive and gender theory. In phase 1 we will conduct focus groups and individual interviews in order to develop and tailor the HIV/partner abuse intervention for adolescent girls and in phase 2 we will evaluate the initial acceptability and feasibility of this intervention in a limited RCT.

"Daily Experience in Adolescence and Biomarkers of Early Risk for Adult Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite calls for the identification of early risk factors for the development of chronic health conditions, there has been little longitudinal research on biomarkers of health that has been conducted in persons younger than 25 years of age. In addition, there is only a minimal understanding of how biological indices of early risk for adult health develop among adolescents with Latin American and Asian backgrounds, the two fastest rising ethnic groups in the United States, who are at differential risk for adverse health outcomes as compared to European Americans. An understanding of these processes is necessary for the development of ethnically and culturally relevant prevention efforts.  We propose a 3-wave longitudinal study of adolescents and their caregivers from Mexican, Chinese and European backgrounds in order to assess the impact of daily experience on biological indicators of early risk for adult health. Our focus on daily experience stems from the need to identify the mechanisms by which global social factors identified in demographic surveys, such as lower education and income, play themselves out in individuals' daily lives. Daily experiences such as social conflict, excessive demands, emotional distress, threat, and sleep behaviors have been shown to be linked to both global risk factors and multiple biological indices of health risk among adults.  The project will include both intensive behavioral assessments and detailed biological markers of health risk from both adolescents and their parents in order to address the following specific aims: (1) describe the development during adolescence of biological indices of early risk for adult health; (2) assess the role of daily experience in the development of early health risk; (3) examine the existence of ethnic disparities in early health risk; and (4) explore the role of potential protective factors in the development of early health risk.  Approximately 540 pairs of adolescents and primary caregivers (180 from each ethnic group) will be assessed when the adolescents are approximately 15-16, 17-18, and 19-20 years of age. Each year, both adolescents and caregivers will participate in interviews that include measures of global social factors such as socioeconomic background and potential protective factors such as social connectedness. Participants will report daily experiences using a nightly diary checklist for 9 consecutive days. Salivary cortisol will be obtained at 4 time points each day for 4 of these days in order to analyze HPA activity, and participants will wear wrist actigraphs for the same 4 days to measure objective sleep behaviors. Blood pressure, BMI, and waist/hip ratio will be assessed, and dried blood spots will be obtained for the assessment of c-reactive-protein (CRP), cholesterol, and high density lipoproteins (HDL). Finally, peripheral blood samples will be provided by a subsample of 120 families for the assessment of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and for gene expression analyses of molecular signaling pathways driving inflammatory biology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is only a minimal understanding of how biological indices of early risk for adult health develop among adolescents with Latin American and Asian backgrounds, the two fastest rising ethnic groups in the United States, who are at differential risk for adverse health outcomes as compared to European American.

"A Culturally Informed Tele-Intervention for Minority High Risk Youth and Parents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (01) Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention and specific Challenge Topic, 06-MD-101* Development of Telehealth Tools to Promote Health and Connect At-Risk Youth to the Health System via Low-Cost, Mobile, and Wireless Technologies. The proposed study is designed to enhance, refine, and test a culturally informed and flexible/tailored intervention for high risk minority adolescents and their parents that is delivered primarily via a mobile/wireless system. This study focuses on high risk African American and Hispanic adolescents and their parents. Rates of HIV, AIDS, STIs, depression and suicide attempts, point to some of the major health disparities that result from an untreated high risk developmental trajectory. The proposed research brings together two teams with strong programs of innovation and research, one with expertise in the use of technology to deliver psychosocial interventions and the PI who has expertise in the development and testing of culturally informed treatments for high risk minority youth. This unique collaboration promises to accelerate each team's individual trajectories and converge on a high innovative tele-intervention for high risk youth. The study: 1) refines and enhances the original Culturally Informed and Flexible Family-Based Treatment for Adolescents (CIFFTA) to meet the needs of African American and Hispanic high risk youth, 2) refines an innovative wireless mobile technology to deliver the intervention in a multi-media format that includes text, audio, video and graphics, 3) pilot tests the new intervention and its delivery system by implementing the intervention with 10 families and conducting focus groups to identify refinements, and 4) conducts a medium-sized randomized trial of 80 African American and Hispanic adolescents ages 12-15 to test for feasibility, acceptability, and to obtain preliminary effect size estimates on key risk factors (conduct problems, academic failure, risky sexual behavior, family conflict). The original CIFFTA was designed to address unique stressors faced by minority youth in a flexible format that leads to the selection of interventions that best ""fit"" the clinical needs and cultural characteristics of the youth. It targets: 1) reducing family risk (e.g., poor parenting practices, family conflict) and increasing protective factors (e.g., Parent-child attachment), 2) teaching adolescent and parents skills, 3) delivering culturally congruent material (e.g., handling discrimination), and 4) using a flexible treatment manual to tailor of the treatment to the unique characteristics and needs of minority families (Santisteban & Mena, in press). By modifying and enhancing the original CIFFTA that has shown promising preliminary data, and adapting it for a wireless and mobile technology that is user friendly for adolescents, the intervention has the potential to mitigate issues of underutilization of services and the inability of interventions to be accessible to youth in the moments they need them most. The intervention will seek to identify the high risk people, times of the day, and locations in the adolescents' lives so that contact is made with youth at those most vulnerable times and interventions can be tailored. Rates of HIV, AIDS, STIs, depression and suicide attempts among African American and Hispanic adolescents, point to some of the major health disparities that can result from an untreated high risk developmental trajectory. The proposed research brings together two teams with strong programs of innovation and research, one with expertise in the use of technology to deliver psychosocial interventions and the PI with expertise in the development and testing of culturally informed and tailored treatments for high risk minority youth.

"Partnership to Address Physical Activity among Low-Income Latino Adolescent Girls    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The aims of the Physical Activity Partnership for Girls (PG) are to: 1) build a strong community-academic partnership and assess community priorities and needs for physical activity (PA) promotion among Latino adolescent girls (age ll-14yr) in Westside San Antonio, Texas; 2) design, jointly, an intervention to increase moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) and reduce sedentary behavior among Latino adolescent girls that can be offered and sustained through Girl Scouts (GS) of Southwest Texas and incorporates low-cost, mobile, and wireless technology to promote health and connect youth to community resources; and, 3) use a group randomized trial design to pilot test the PA intervention to ascertain its feasibility and effects among Latino adolescent girls. In year 1, we propose to conduct formative assessments and develop the intervention in full partnership with two local organizations in the target area, one serving youth and one serving families, as well as other community partners via a Community Advisory Board. Data gathered from 4 parent focus groups (~50 participants), 10 in-depth interviews, 5 GS groups (~60 participants) using the photovoice assessment strategy, and 100 media survey participants will inform the development of an intervention to promote MVPA and reduce sedentary behaviors among Latino adolescent girls. In year 2, the intervention will be implemented in the Westside by GS troop leaders with guidance and support from research staff. Standardized assessments will occur at baseline, 3-months, and 6-months and PA will be assessed using accelerometers and PA recall questionnaires. We hypothesize that a significantly higher percententage of participants randomized to the PA intervention will meet the PA recommendation for MVPA (60 min/d) and sedentary behavior (<2 hr/d) compared to those randomized to the usual GS program (primary outcomes); show greater increases in social support, self-efficacy, enjoyment of PA, cardiorespiratory fitness, and less gain in weight and Body Mass Index (secondary outcomes) compared to the control group.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): Hispanic adolescent girls are burdened with high levels of obesity and are less active than the general adolescent population.

"Alcohol, Marijuana, and Risky Sex: Group Interventions with Detained Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescents are at great risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including HIV/AIDS, and are one of few HIV risk groups for whom HIV/AIDS incidence is not declining (CDC, 2005a). Compared to the general adolescent population, adolescents involved with the criminal justice system are younger at first intercourse, have a greater number of sex partners, and lower rates of condom use, resulting in higher rates of unintended pregnancy and STDs (e.g., Teplin, Mericle, McClelland & Abram, 2003). Data from our previous research efforts suggests that it is heavy alcohol use in concert with sexual activity, rather than heavy alcohol use generally, that is most strongly related to lack of condom use (Bryan, Ray, & Cooper, in press). Further, we have demonstrated initially higher rates of condom use at follow-up among adolescents who participated in a combined sexual risk reduction + alcohol risk reduction intervention as compared to a sexual risk reduction only intervention and an information only control intervention in our prior NIAAA-supported randomized controlled intervention with incarcerated adolescents, (R01 AA013844-01; Schmiege, Broaddus, Bryan, et al., 2008). The goal of the proposed study is to build on those successful findings, and on our ongoing work (RO1 DA019139-01) and that of others (Lebeau-Craven et al., 2003; Kingree & Betz, 2003) which suggests that marijuana use is more prevalent than alcohol use generally and during sex than is alcohol use among criminally-involved adolescents. In addition, NIDA has noted that marijuana is a specific drug of abuse that may be an emerging risk factor for HIV and STDs, but one for which there is little basic or intervention research. In this continuation, we propose to conduct a second randomized controlled trial to compare an expanded sexual risk reduction intervention that includes both an alcohol component and a marijuana component, to a sexual risk reduction intervention that includes only an alcohol component, and a sexual risk reduction only condition. Each of these interventions includes a standard theory-based didactic presentation of sexual reduction intervention material and a group motivational enhancement therapy component focused on alcohol and marijuana, alcohol use only, or sexual risk behavior only. We hope to show that: 1) combining both substances into one intervention further increases its efficacy at decreasing sexual risk behavior because of its broad coverage of the three most highly prevalent risk behaviors (alcohol, marijuana, and unprotected sex) in this population, 2) it is the substance use content, and not the group MET modality that is responsible for this increased efficacy, and 3) the intervention exerts its effects through theoretically-based mediators. The relative success of these interventions will have implications for HIV/STD risk reduction programming for high risk adolescents in the criminal justice system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescents involved with the criminal justice system are younger at first intercourse, have a greater number of sex partners, and lower rates of condom use than their non criminally-involved counterparts. This high level of sexual risk results in higher rates of unintended pregnancy and STDs including HIV/AIDS. These young people also have extraordinarily high rates of alcohol and marijuana use, and many have demonstrated that substance use plays a causal role in sexual risk. This research is designed to implement and carefully evaluate new intervention technologies that have the goal of decrease alcohol- and marijuana-related sexual risk behavior in this population of highly vulnerable young people.                 Adolescents involved with the criminal justice system are younger at first intercourse, have a greater number of sex partners, and lower rates of condom use than their non criminally-involved counterparts.

"The cultural context of health disparities in adolescent girls    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in reproductive health (STDs, unintended pregnancy) and overweight/obesity are well- established by adolescence, with African-American and Latina adolescent girls at greatest risk. Although not often studied together, reproductive health and overweight/obesity share important features relevant to the success of prevention efforts. In particular, the behavioral antecedents of these health outcomes (i.e., sexual behaviors, physical activity) are both heavily influenced by cultural factors (Kumanyika, 2007; Logan, Cole & Leukefeld, 2002). Using developmental niche as a guiding framework, the aim of this exploratory study is to identify ways that parents' culturally rooted ideas about gender are infused into family life and may indirectly influence the risk of STDs, unintended pregnancy, and overweight/obesity in adolescent girls.  In developmental niche theory (Harkness & Super, 1994; 2006), information about the microenvironment of the child can be organized into three interrelated components: 1) physical and social settings, 2) customs involved in childrearing, and 3) ethnotheories of the caregivers. Analysis of these three components provides a means of detailing the complex and implicit ways that culture is instantiated into daily family life. This approach is consistent with calls from leading scholars and NIH to move beyond broad labels of race, ethnicity, or immigration status to instead focus on the processes by which culture and acculturation shape child development (e.g., Bornstein & Cote, 2007; Quintana et al., 2006). Such efforts are particularly important to advance research on the familial context of adolescent health disparities because constructs that are important for understanding families of color may not emerge in studies that only include measures developed on White, middle class families (e.g., Boyce & Fuligni, 2007).  Interviews will be conducted with 200 adolescent girls in 9th-10th grade (50% Latina, 25% African- American/Black, 25% non-Hispanic White) and their mothers/female caretakers. Participants will complete self-report survey measures, a q-sort task, calendars, ethnographic interviews, and a videotaped dyadic activity. Measures have been selected to assess adolescent behaviors (sexual and physical activity) and cognitions (knowledge, attitudes, norms, efficacy) based on prevailing health models (e.g., Fishbein et al., 2001), as well as three components of the family context as conceptualized in the developmental niche framework. Data will be analyzed using both qualitative methods (e.g., thematic analysis) and quantitative strategies (e.g., structural equation modeling). The proposed project builds on several studies by the research team addressing adolescent reproductive health, the social context of obesity, and the delivery of evidence-based intervention programs to low-income and minority populations. Findings from this study will be used by the investigators and community collaborators to develop evidence-based health programming for adolescent girls that is gender-responsive and developmentally and culturally relevant.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescents of color have heightened rates of STDs, unintended pregnancy, and overweight/obesity. Despite widespread awareness of individual risk and protective factors for these health outcomes, interventions aimed at reducing their occurrence have been only moderately successful, in part because contextual factors have not been adequately addressed. The proposed study will provide insight into the familial and cultural context of health disparities among adolescent girls and young women.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Adolescents of color have heightened rates of STDs, unintended pregnancy, and overweight/obesity.

Likewise, early initiation of using alcohol and other substances and early sexual behaviors may contribute to increased risks for chronic conditions such as HIV and STIs and can lead to teen pregnancy (DiClemente, 1996), as well as adverse social outcomes such as dropping out of school and delinquency. Windle et al (2004) state that ""It is widely recognized that health-related behaviors that unfold in adolescence are foreshadowed by children's earlier experiences in the family, school, and community."" Little research has been done to identify and trace these multiple influences during the pre-adolescent period or to examine the importance of racial and ethnic differences in the way these behaviors develop. Healthy Passages (HP) was designed to advance the research literature on child and adolescent health by providing information on a broad range of outcomes and a comprehensive, multilevel set of factors to function as predictors of the occurrence, maintenance, and change of health risk and protective behaviors across time. In addition, HP provides biennial in-depth assessment over ten years (beginning in fifth grade) to provide data needed to characterize the primary influences on adolescent health behaviors and health and educational outcomes. The overarching objective of HP is to provide an empirical basis for effective policies and intervention programs to promote the health and optimal development of adolescents and adults. The study has two major goals. The first goal is the characterization of developmental trajectories and the relative contribution of important multilevel risk and protective factors on health behaviors. The second goal is elucidation of multilevel risk and protective factors that contribute to disparities in health, educational, and social outcomes by race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status (Levanthal, 2000; Lowry, 1996; Starfield, 2002). HP includes a broad range of determinants and health risk and protective behaviors. By understanding determinants, we are better able to develop interventions related to many of the Healthy People 2010 objectives.           Relevance statement: Youth live in a number of different contexts (such as home, school, neighborhood and community) and are influenced by many different individuals (e.g., parents, peers, teachers, and siblings).

"""Development and Crash Injury Risk in Adolescent Latino Males""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unintentional injury remains the leading cause of death in children over age one. This is no different for children entering and traversing the adolescent period of life (age 10 - age 18). While adolescence has been described as a development period of strength and resilience, experts have highlighted the dual paradox that exists during this time of life. This dual paradox describes adolescence as a time of increased injury-related morbidity and mortality rates despite it also being a time of acquiring greater physical strength and capacity for decision-making. Because of their higher than expected mortality rate as they navigate the adolescent and emerging adult period of life, Latino adolescent males have been identified as the anomaly to the Latino Epidemiological Paradox. Cause of death during this time is largely attributed to motor vehicle crashes. The research proposed in this application will explore adolescent developmental sources of crash risk in the context of Latino and youth culture. The first component of this research program will involve analysis of data sets from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. It will provide longitudinal information on adolescent friend influence on risky driving behavior in the general population. The second component will involve comprehensive in-depth interviews of Latino adolescent males in order gain greater insight into Latino and youth culture and risky driving behavior. The last research component will utilize survey and diaries methodologies to elucidate the social context of risky driving in Latino adolescents and how this changes over the adolescent and emerging adult periods of life.  Successfully completing this training and research, the applicant will acquire a skill set needed to become an independent clinical investigator. Furthermore, the information gained will lead to broader understanding of injury disparity in Latino adolescent males and be applied to future development of a clinical contact injury prevention intervention.         ","""Development and Crash Injury Risk in Adolescent Latino Males""",8124874,K23HD050630,"['Vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' insight ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Future ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Knowledge ', ' Communities ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Friends ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' injured ', ' effective intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' resilience ', ' clinical care ', ' Parents ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' male ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' skills ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Funding ', ' Latino ', ' Cause of Death ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Life ', ' Link ', ' Health ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Testing ', ' Clinical ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Data ', ' Research ', ' diaries ', ' Age ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Source ', ' Risk ', ' Individual ', ' Injury ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Behavior ', ' Time ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Interview ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' driving behavior ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' injury prevention ', ' decision-making capacity ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' ']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2011,125588,0.05304398261450578
"Mexican-origin Teen Moms, Their Infants, and Mother Figures: Health & Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will examine how developmental, family, cultural, and economic factors interact to inform the health and development of two groups of children who are disproportionately at risk for negative health outcomes: Mexican-origin adolescent mothers and their young children. Adolescent females of Mexican origin have the highest national birthrate, and it is over twice the overall national rate (National Vital Statistics Report, 2005). Because children of adolescent mothers are at increased risk for negative outcomes (Chandra, Schivello, Ravi, Weinstein, & Hook, 2002) and adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning has been identified as a predictor of children's health and development (Carothers, Borkowski, Lefever, & Whitman, 2005), it is critical to examine the factors that inform adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning, their parenting behaviors, and in turn, their children's health and development. We propose to build on our study of Mexican-origin adolescent mothers, their mothers or mother figures (referred to in our study as the female family member; FFM), and their infants, which involved data gathered from adolescents and FFMs during the adolescents' third trimester of pregnancy (Wave 1), and from adolescent mothers, FFMs, and infants when infants were 10 months of age (Wave 2) and again when infants were 24 months of age (Wave 3). We propose to collect three additional points of measurement from all three family members in the 206 families who participated in the original project (N = 618). This longitudinal, multi-generational study will capture cultural, family, and developmental processes and outcomes for a) adolescent mothers and FFMs over a five-year period beginning when adolescent mothers are in middle/late adolescence (i.e., 15-18 years of age) through emerging adulthood (20-23 years of age), and b) their young children from infancy (i.e., 10 months) through early childhood (i.e., 5 yrs of age). Specific aims are to examine (1) the linkages between trajectories of two normative developmental processes (i.e., ethnic identity, autonomy) and trajectories of Mexican-origin adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning (e.g., depressive symptoms) from middle/late adolescence through emerging adulthood, and to identify family, peer, and cultural characteristics that moderate these associations; (2) how family (i.e., mother-adolescent conflict), economic (i.e., economic hardship), and cultural (i.e., acculturative stress and discrimination) stressors are linked to adolescent mothers' trajectories of psychosocial functioning, and to investigate the family, peer, and cultural characteristics that moderate these associations; and (3) how trajectories of adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning predict their parenting behaviors and, in turn, trajectories of their children's health and development; we also will test family, peer, and cultural characteristics that moderate these associations. A focus on Mexican- origin children is critical because Latinos (of which Mexican-origin are a majority) are repeatedly identified as an at-risk population for negative health and behavioral outcomes and, in fact, show substantial risk for maladjustment in almost all leading health indicators identified by Healthy People 2010 (CDC, 2008).    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latinos show greater risk for maladjustment in almost all of the leading health indicators identified by Healthy People 2010 (CDC, 2008) and bear a disproportionate burden of disease, injury, death, and disability in the U.S. (CDC, 2004a). Furthermore, Mexican-origin adolescent females lead the nation in rates of teen pregnancy (with rates over twice the national average; National Vital Statistics Report, 2005). This research will contribute significantly to understanding how to promote positive health and development among Mexican-origin adolescent mothers and their young children, which is in line with the Surgeon General's call to address health disparities among Latinos and other ethnic minorities (U.S. Surgeon General, 2008). Project Narrative  Latinos show greater risk for maladjustment in almost all of the leading health indicators identified by Healthy  People 2010 (CDC, 2008) and bear a disproportionate burden of disease, injury, death, and disability in the  U.S. (CDC, 2004a).

"CBPR to improve African American environments for youth obesity prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This U13 application responds to NICHD PAR-09-092 in the broad focus area of child, adolescent, and adult obesity. Interventions that impact upon obesity in African American children and youth, especially females, are critically needed given the steeper than average trajectory of increase and high obesity prevalence in African American children and youth, especially females. The domain of obesity research is defined here to include determinants of food, physical activity, and weight control at both environmental and individual levels and their relationships to obesity and related morbidity and mortality. This broad domain has intrinsic connections to a spectrum of potential community issues and priorities. Activities will be designed to identify the community's perceived areas of interest for addressing disparities related to obesity, with a particular focus on youth engagement. These activities will be undertaken under the rubric of the African American Collaborative Obesity Research Network (AACORN), a national organization based at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. Funds requested in this application would support engagement of youth and adult community members in planning and implementing two community-focused, national workshops, in 2010 and 2012, reflecting community priorities for social change activities related to childhood obesity prevention. Specific aims are to: 1) Implement creative new methods of enabling youth partners to share their perspectives, become more informed, and identify priorities about issues related to eating, physical activity, and body weight; 2) Create an advisory board that will stimulate dialogue among youth and adult community members and academic researchers about issues and priorities in these focus areas; 3)Identify and engage, through a memorandum of understanding, at least one youth focused, community organization as a community based participatory research (CBPR) partner; 4) With community partners and the advisory board, plan and implement a specific component of AACORN's 2010 and 2012 workshops that will provide for conjoint community and academic researcher capacity building and establish a foundation for planning longer term cross-learning and CBPR activities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need to increase the direct involvement of African American community members and organizations in the generation of endogenous solutions to obesity and related health and quality of life issues is great.

"Biopsychosocial Determinants of Adolescent Obesity/Cardiovascular Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of adolescent obesity is high in the U.S., and in Latin America. While dramatic environmental changes in the food and physical environment are associated with increased risk, there continues to be inadequate understanding of the individual, family and community level factors that protect against the development of obesity. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms leading to disparate risk for obesity in low-income and Hispanic/Latino youth. The proposed 5-year project aims to elucidate interconnected biological and social pathways associated with adolescent obesity and risk for later development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This application involves approximately 620 Chilean adolescents, assessed in infancy, 3 to 5 years and 10 years as part of a NIH-supported cohort study of the behavioral and developmental effects of preventing iron deficiency anemia in infancy (n = 1645). As such, detailed longitudinal data related to growth, health and development have been collected. At 16 to 17 years, the youth will participate in study of activity, sleep and eating patterns using actigraphic recording and laboratory assessment of eating behavior. In addition, we will measure anthropometry, fat and muscle mass (DXA), fasting glucose, insulin (HOMA IR), lipids, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, orexin, CRP, and TNF alpha. Detailed information about family history, smoking, health, and psychosocial functioning will also be collected. Neighborhood level factors such as crime, walk ability and resources for physical activity and healthful food attributes will be assessed. Furthermore, a sizeable subset (n = 237) with sleep neurophysiology and actigraphic recordings at multiple time points will participate in 2-night polysmnographic sleep study at 16 years.    Guided by a life-course approach, we propose to investigate three Specific Aims:    Specific Aim 1 - To evaluate biological and psychosocial determinants of obesity and related metabolic disturbance in a cohort of adolescents followed since early infancy.    Specific Aim 2  - To assess associations between obesity/adiposity and biomarkers of adiposity-related metabolic disturbance in this sample of Chilean adolescents.    Specific Aim 3 - To assess the role of circadian patterns of physical activity, sleep and eating behavior on adiposity and related metabolic disturbance.    The long standing collaboration between the Institute for Nutrition and Technology at the University of Chile and the Center for Human Growth and Development at the University of Michigan provides an outstanding environment to study biological and psychosocial determinants of adolescent obesity in a low- to middle-income cohort of Latin American youth who are very similar in obesity risk to comparable U.S. youth. We expect to advance understanding of how developmental patterns of eating and activity are influenced by early life factors and in turn influence the development of obesity and related metabolic disturbance. Our study is unique in the depth and breadth of longitudinal psychosocial and biological data. We propose research that crosses disciplinary boundaries and has the potential to reveal important determinants of adolescent obesity for future intervention research. PUBLIC HEATLH RELEVANCE: Adolescent obesity develops during childhood in response to biological factors and social conditions. While biological factors such as genetic inheritance are difficult to change, social factors could be targets for preventive efforts. We expect to further understanding of the environmental and social conditions related to the development of obesity in a high risk urban, Hispanic/Latino population. We are interested in how children develop circadian rhythms related to eating, sleeping and activity, and subsequently how these patterns lead to obesity. Our goal is to unveil modifiable conditions in order to prevent obesity and related diseases including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.          ",Biopsychosocial Determinants of Adolescent

"College Students as Facilitators to Reduce Adolescent Obesity Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Appalachian region has a population of 23 million residing in 420 counties and 13 states. Forty-two percent of the region's population is rural. Compared to other regions, people living in Appalachia were reported to face a heavier burden from chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. The proportions of obese high school students in Southern Appalachia are among the highest in the nation. Health risk habits including unhealthy eating and physical inactivity are often established during adolescence and may contribute significantly to this chronic disease disparity. Although adolescent obesity is an urgent public health issue, effective interventions are few. Therefore, we propose to test an academia-community partnership approach using college students as facilitators to prevent obesity among adolescents. The long-term goal is to establish an effective academia-community partnership program to address adolescent obesity disparity in Southern Appalachia. The specific aims are: 1) To develop a peer- based health education program focusing on establishing positive peer norms and supportive peer relationships toward healthy eating and physical activity among high school students, 2) To test the efficacy of the program, and 3) To explore the mechanisms underlying the program. Twelve (six per each semester) undergraduates at East Tennessee State University will be trained to conduct an eleven-week peer-based health education program as peer facilitators. A cluster-randomized trial design will be used and 6 rural high schools will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. Approximately 1440 adolescents will be included as study subjects. Body mass index (BMI) percentile, dietary behavior, and physical activity among the study subjects will be assessed pre-intervention, at the end of the intervention, and 12 months post-intervention. Mean levels and/or prevalence of differences in the assessments (BMI percentile, obesity status, eating behavior, and physical activity) will be compared between the intervention and control group at the 3 time points (pre-intervention, end of intervention, and 12 months post-intervention). Peer group norms, body image, supportive peer relationships, role modeling, behavioral control/self-efficacy, attitudes, and intentions toward healthy eating and physical activity will be assessed pre-intervention, at the end of the intervention, and 12 months post-intervention. The roles of these factors as mediators of the intervention in modifying adolescents' eating and physical activity behaviors, as well as, body mass index will be examined. This proposed study will provide an important evaluation of an academia-community partnership using college students as facilitators to address adolescent obesity disparity in Southern Appalachia. If proven effective, the proposed program can meet the critical community needs for adolescent obesity prevention by engaging higher education institutes and students in service and fostering within them an ethic of civic responsibility. The program will be easily transferable from research to action without substantial additional resources and will be a sustainable win-win program for both the community and the academy. 1      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed study will provide an important evaluation of a peer-based program.

"Alcohol, Marijuana, and Risky Sex: Group Interventions with Detained Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescents are at great risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including HIV/AIDS, and are one of few HIV risk groups for whom HIV/AIDS incidence is not declining (CDC, 2005a). Compared to the general adolescent population, adolescents involved with the criminal justice system are younger at first intercourse, have a greater number of sex partners, and lower rates of condom use, resulting in higher rates of unintended pregnancy and STDs (e.g., Teplin, Mericle, McClelland & Abram, 2003). Data from our previous research efforts suggests that it is heavy alcohol use in concert with sexual activity, rather than heavy alcohol use generally, that is most strongly related to lack of condom use (Bryan, Ray, & Cooper, in press). Further, we have demonstrated initially higher rates of condom use at follow-up among adolescents who participated in a combined sexual risk reduction + alcohol risk reduction intervention as compared to a sexual risk reduction only intervention and an information only control intervention in our prior NIAAA-supported randomized controlled intervention with incarcerated adolescents, (R01 AA013844-01; Schmiege, Broaddus, Bryan, et al., 2008). The goal of the proposed study is to build on those successful findings, and on our ongoing work (RO1 DA019139-01) and that of others (Lebeau-Craven et al., 2003; Kingree & Betz, 2003) which suggests that marijuana use is more prevalent than alcohol use generally and during sex than is alcohol use among criminally-involved adolescents. In addition, NIDA has noted that marijuana is a specific drug of abuse that may be an emerging risk factor for HIV and STDs, but one for which there is little basic or intervention research. In this continuation, we propose to conduct a second randomized controlled trial to compare an expanded sexual risk reduction intervention that includes both an alcohol component and a marijuana component, to a sexual risk reduction intervention that includes only an alcohol component, and a sexual risk reduction only condition. Each of these interventions includes a standard theory-based didactic presentation of sexual reduction intervention material and a group motivational enhancement therapy component focused on alcohol and marijuana, alcohol use only, or sexual risk behavior only. We hope to show that: 1) combining both substances into one intervention further increases its efficacy at decreasing sexual risk behavior because of its broad coverage of the three most highly prevalent risk behaviors (alcohol, marijuana, and unprotected sex) in this population, 2) it is the substance use content, and not the group MET modality that is responsible for this increased efficacy, and 3) the intervention exerts its effects through theoretically-based mediators. The relative success of these interventions will have implications for HIV/STD risk reduction programming for high risk adolescents in the criminal justice system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescents involved with the criminal justice system are younger at first intercourse, have a greater number of sex partners, and lower rates of condom use than their non criminally-involved counterparts. This high level of sexual risk results in higher rates of unintended pregnancy and STDs including HIV/AIDS. These young people also have extraordinarily high rates of alcohol and marijuana use, and many have demonstrated that substance use plays a causal role in sexual risk. This research is designed to implement and carefully evaluate new intervention technologies that have the goal of decrease alcohol- and marijuana-related sexual risk behavior in this population of highly vulnerable young people.                 Adolescents involved with the criminal justice system are younger at first intercourse, have a greater number of sex partners, and lower rates of condom use than their non criminally-involved counterparts.

"The cultural context of health disparities in adolescent girls    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in reproductive health (STDs, unintended pregnancy) and overweight/obesity are well- established by adolescence, with African-American and Latina adolescent girls at greatest risk. Although not often studied together, reproductive health and overweight/obesity share important features relevant to the success of prevention efforts. In particular, the behavioral antecedents of these health outcomes (i.e., sexual behaviors, physical activity) are both heavily influenced by cultural factors (Kumanyika, 2007; Logan, Cole & Leukefeld, 2002). Using developmental niche as a guiding framework, the aim of this exploratory study is to identify ways that parents' culturally rooted ideas about gender are infused into family life and may indirectly influence the risk of STDs, unintended pregnancy, and overweight/obesity in adolescent girls.  In developmental niche theory (Harkness & Super, 1994; 2006), information about the microenvironment of the child can be organized into three interrelated components: 1) physical and social settings, 2) customs involved in childrearing, and 3) ethnotheories of the caregivers. Analysis of these three components provides a means of detailing the complex and implicit ways that culture is instantiated into daily family life. This approach is consistent with calls from leading scholars and NIH to move beyond broad labels of race, ethnicity, or immigration status to instead focus on the processes by which culture and acculturation shape child development (e.g., Bornstein & Cote, 2007; Quintana et al., 2006). Such efforts are particularly important to advance research on the familial context of adolescent health disparities because constructs that are important for understanding families of color may not emerge in studies that only include measures developed on White, middle class families (e.g., Boyce & Fuligni, 2007).  Interviews will be conducted with 200 adolescent girls in 9th-10th grade (50% Latina, 25% African- American/Black, 25% non-Hispanic White) and their mothers/female caretakers. Participants will complete self-report survey measures, a q-sort task, calendars, ethnographic interviews, and a videotaped dyadic activity. Measures have been selected to assess adolescent behaviors (sexual and physical activity) and cognitions (knowledge, attitudes, norms, efficacy) based on prevailing health models (e.g., Fishbein et al., 2001), as well as three components of the family context as conceptualized in the developmental niche framework. Data will be analyzed using both qualitative methods (e.g., thematic analysis) and quantitative strategies (e.g., structural equation modeling). The proposed project builds on several studies by the research team addressing adolescent reproductive health, the social context of obesity, and the delivery of evidence-based intervention programs to low-income and minority populations. Findings from this study will be used by the investigators and community collaborators to develop evidence-based health programming for adolescent girls that is gender-responsive and developmentally and culturally relevant.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescents of color have heightened rates of STDs, unintended pregnancy, and overweight/obesity. Despite widespread awareness of individual risk and protective factors for these health outcomes, interventions aimed at reducing their occurrence have been only moderately successful, in part because contextual factors have not been adequately addressed. The proposed study will provide insight into the familial and cultural context of health disparities among adolescent girls and young women.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Adolescents of color have heightened rates of STDs, unintended pregnancy, and overweight/obesity.

"Factors Associated with Teens' Non-Responsiveness to HIV Intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am committed to a career in HIV/STD prevention research. To become a fully independent investigator, I am applying for the NIMH Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) to augment my training and research in HIV/STD prevention research for vulnerable adolescents. Towards this goal, I will participate in courses, workshops, seminars, and mentoring meetings to enhance my existing knowledge and research skills, and acquire new knowledge and research skills specific to the design, implementation, adaptation and evaluation of HIV/STD prevention programs for adolescents. My proposed research plan, to be conducted at Emory University and the Fulton County Department of Health and Wellness, in Atlanta, Georgia, with the guidance of my Mentors (Primary Mentor: R. DiClemente, Co-Mentors: G. Wingood and S. Kalichman), can contribute significantly to the field of adolescent HIV prevention science in substantive and practical ways. Study 1 is a mixed-method study patterned after research conducted by my Co-Mentor (Dr. Kalichman), designed to: 1) identify the proportion of African-American female adolescents exposed to an HIV intervention that do not change their condom use, and 2) describe the personal, behavioral and psychosocial factors associated with ""failure to change"" condom use following an HIV intervention. Data from Study 1 directly informs Study 2. In Study 2, I will adapt an existing effective gender and culturally tailored adolescent HIV intervention developed by my Mentors (Dr. DiClemente, & Dr. Wingood), to enhance its efficacy for promoting condom use among African-American female adolescents who did not change their condom use after participating in an HIV intervention. The adaptation process will be guided by a sequential and systematic adaptation model, developed by Drs. Wingood and DiClemente, to facilitate the adaptation process. Study 2 is also a pilot test of the effectiveness of the adapted SiHLE intervention for this subgroup of non-responsive adolescents. The findings from the two studies in this application will make significant contributions to our understanding of adolescent sexual risk behavior and the development of effective HIV interventions which could modify the risk trajectory for HIV acquisition in hard-to-change adolescents.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV prevention interventions tailored for African-American adolescent females who are non-responsive to sexual behavior risk-reduction interventions are urgently needed as these individuals are at especially high- risk for contracting HIV/STDs. The adoption of the adapted SiHLE intervention by other health departments and community-based AIDS service organizations has the potential to reach a broad audience and a population substantially impacted by the HIV epidemic.           ",Factors Associated with Teens' Non-Responsiveness to HIV Intervention,8049640,K01MH085506,"['meetings ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', '

"Symptom Severity, Treatment Engagement, and Outcomes for Culturally Diverse Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this research proposal is to investigate the patterns and roles of symptom severity and service engagement in community-based mental health services for diverse adolescent populations. Researchers and policy-makers have highlighted the need for a better understanding of the various factors contributing to issues related to mental health service utilization, engagement, and outcomes for ethnic minorities. Unfortunately, empirical research regarding these factors remains sparse. This research proposal addresses gaps in the literature by: 1) Examining the relationship between race/ethnicity and acculturation to symptom severity at treatment entry for a diverse adolescent sample, 2) Examining the relationship between symptom severity and treatment outcomes for a diverse adolescent sample, and 3)   Examining the role of treatment engagement in treatment outcomes for a diverse adolescent sample. The sample will consist of 260 adolescents (aged 12-19) who have received school and clinic-based mental health services, their parents, and their therapists. Secondary data analysis will be based on data collection from a baseline interview and four follow-up interviews over the course of 12 months. Research instruments measure symptom severity, engagement in treatment, sociodemographics, and treatment outcomes. Analysis will involve descriptive statistics, multiple regression models, and moderation and mediation effects on these models/equations.   Findings from this research proposal have potentially significant implications for improving the delivery and quality of care for ethnic minority adolescents. Increased understanding of the relationships between these various factors may better inform therapists as to the important considerations and factors involved in working with ethnic minority groups.             ","Symptom Severity, Treatment Engagement, and Outcomes for Culturally Diverse Youth",8033803,F31MH082607,"['Psychotherapeutic Processes ', ' Psychiatric Therapeutic Processes ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Inferior ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Client ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Individual ', ' Address ', ' Coupled ', ' Training ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Surgeon ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Custom ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Country ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Dimensions ', ' evidence base ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Accounting ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Interview ', ' United States ', ' Services ', ' Population ', ' Data Collection ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Severities ', ' Work ', ' Bass ', ' Measures ', ' Data ', ' Age ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Clinic ', ' Attention ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Belief ', ' Schools ', ' Pattern ', ' cultural competence ', ' instrument ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Goals ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' aged ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Parents ', ' Literature ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Societies ', ' statistics ', ' Communities ', ' base ', ' Research ', ' Sampling ', ' Testing ', ' Ensure ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Equation ', ' Symptoms ', ' ']",NIMH,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2011,11808,0.038053780389659966
"The Effects of Prenatal Cocaine Exposure in Adolescence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a continuation of grant R01 DA07957 ""The Effects of Prenatal Cocaine Exposure at School Age,"" a longitudinal study of the prenatal effects of cocaine/polydrug exposure (n=382; 194 cocaine-exposed and 188 non-cocaine-exposed). This study, as well as others, has found differences among prenatally cocaine- exposed children that include deficits in perceptual reasoning, attention, language development and externalizing behavior problems compared to non-exposed children. The effects of environmental lead exposure and the differential impact of caregiver placement have been identified as important determinants of early developmental outcomes in this cohort, indicating the need for continued study at this developmental stage of newly emerging risk behaviors and social stress. We propose following this large cohort from age 15 through 18 years with the overarching objective of determining whether the negative effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on brain development continue to interfere with optimal developmental outcomes, and if cocaine exposure is associated with increased incidence of risky behavior, particularly substance misuse and mental health problems. Adolescents will be assessed using self and caregiver report, interview, bioassay and standardized assessments. Specific aims are to: assess the relationship of prenatal cocaine exposure to cognitive and behavioral outcomes (risk taking and mental health problems) in adolescence and to assess lead levels, iron deficiency, caregiving and environmental correlates of exposure; explore models that assess the relationship of early cognitive deficits and behavior problems to risk taking behaviors in an adolescent high-risk cocaine/polydrug exposed cohort; assess parenting experiences and behaviors of caregivers of cocaine- exposed and non-exposed adolescents; and assess the direct and indirect relationships of prenatal cocaine exposure to adolescent behavioral outcomes. Our model focuses on the mediating effects of earlier deficits in cognitive performance, attention and inhibitory control on risk taking behavior and the moderating effects of gender. Effects of lead exposure, iron deficiency and caregiving environment will be explored using structural equation modeling (SEM) and path modeling. The results of this study will provide the basis for designing culturally sensitive interventions prenatally or early in life that could reduce risky teen behaviors and ultimately reduce serious lifelong health problems including substance dependence, trauma and HIV infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A pattern of attention, behavioral regulation and cognitive problems among prenatally cocaine-exposed infants and children has been identified by this research group as well as others. Results indicate that fetal exposure to cocaine may have specific effects on brain development that can be observed in early cognitive and behavioral outcomes and that outcomes are also influenced by level of environmental lead exposure and caregiving quality. This study hypothesizes that the pattern of deficits found in childhood may translate into greater risk taking behavior including substance misuse and mental health problems in adolescence that can have grave consequences on adult productivity and health. Further research on prenatally cocaine-exposed adolescents will identify key points for the timing and focus of intervention and provide important content for public health messages.           7.

"Mexican-origin Teen Moms, Their Infants, and Mother Figures: Health & Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will examine how developmental, family, cultural, and economic factors interact to inform the health and development of two groups of children who are disproportionately at risk for negative health outcomes:  Mexican-origin adolescent mothers and their young children. Adolescent females of Mexican origin have the highest national birthrate, and it is over twice the overall national rate (National Vital Statistics Report, 2005).  Because children of adolescent mothers are at increased risk for negative outcomes (Chandra, Schivello, Ravi, Weinstein, & Hook, 2002) and adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning has been identified as a predictor of children's health and development (Carothers, Borkowski, Lefever, & Whitman, 2005), it is critical to examine the factors that inform adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning, their parenting behaviors, and in turn, their children's health and development. We propose to build on our study of Mexican-origin adolescent mothers, their mothers or mother figures (referred to in our study as the female family member; FFM), and their infants, which involved data gathered from adolescents and FFMs during the adolescents' third trimester of pregnancy (Wave 1), and from adolescent mothers, FFMs, and infants when infants were 10 months of age (Wave 2) and again when infants were 24 months of age (Wave 3). We propose to collect three additional points of measurement from all three family members in the 206 families who participated in the original project (N = 618).  This longitudinal, multi-generational study will capture cultural, family, and developmental processes and outcomes for a) adolescent mothers and FFMs over a five-year period beginning when adolescent mothers are in middle/late adolescence (i.e., 15-18 years of age) through emerging adulthood (20-23 years of age), and b) their young children from infancy (i.e., 10 months) through early childhood (i.e., 5 yrs of age). Specific aims are  to examine (1) the linkages between trajectories of two normative developmental processes (i.e., ethnic identity,  autonomy) and trajectories of Mexican-origin adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning (e.g., depressive  symptoms) from middle/late adolescence through emerging adulthood, and to identify family, peer, and cultural  characteristics that moderate these associations; (2) how family (i.e., mother-adolescent conflict), economic  (i.e., economic hardship), and cultural (i.e., acculturative stress and discrimination) stressors are linked to  adolescent mothers' trajectories of psychosocial functioning, and to investigate the family, peer, and cultural  characteristics that moderate these associations; and (3) how trajectories of adolescent mothers' psychosocial  functioning predict their parenting behaviors and, in turn, trajectories of their children's health and development;  we also will test family, peer, and cultural characteristics that moderate these associations. A focus on Mexican-  origin children is critical because Latinos (of which Mexican-origin are a majority) are repeatedly identified as an  at-risk population for negative health and behavioral outcomes and, in fact, show substantial risk for  maladjustment in almost all leading health indicators identified by Healthy People 2010 (CDC, 2008).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latinos show greater risk for maladjustment in almost all of the leading health indicators identified by Healthy  People 2010 (CDC, 2008) and bear a disproportionate burden of disease, injury, death, and disability in the  U.S. (CDC, 2004a). Furthermore, Mexican-origin adolescent females lead the nation in rates of teen pregnancy (with rates over twice the national average; National Vital Statistics Report, 2005). This research will contribute significantly to understanding how to promote positive health and development among Mexican-origin adolescent mothers and their young children, which is in line with the Surgeon General's call to address health disparities among Latinos and other ethnic minorities (U.S. Surgeon General, 2008).          Project Narrative  Latinos show greater risk for maladjustment in almost all of the leading health indicators identified by Healthy  People 2010 (CDC, 2008) and bear a disproportionate burden of disease, injury, death, and disability in the  U.S. (CDC, 2004a).

"Urethral Microbiome of Adolescent Males    DESCRIPTION: The microflora of the anterior male urethra during adolescence is poorly described and no data address the range of ""typical"" urethral microflora during adolescence as functions of pubertal development or onset of various types of partnered sexual activity. This means that current understanding of the urethral microbiome in adolescent men rests entirely on data drawn from adults, and from epidemiologic and behavioral explanations. Marked ethnic group variation in adolescent sexual behaviors and disparity in conditions such as sexually transmitted infections (STI) justifies exploration of potential ethnic group differences in the male urethral microflora. Some research among adult males suggests important interactions between the male urethral microflora and STI, but this research has not been extended to younger men. Here we propose to characterize the male urethral microbiome in longitudinal urine samples collected from a multi-ethnic cohort of adolescent males. Microbial flora will be assessed as function of pubertal development, sexual activity, and incident STI. Subjects will be Latino (N=24), African-American (N=24), and Euro-American (N=24) males, ages 14 - 17 at enrollment; total N=72). Participants will be recruited from an urban clinic within an area of high prevalence of STI. Socio-demographic data will be collected at enrollment. Daily behavioral and symptomologic data will be collected via cell phone, which will also be used for cohort maintenance and scheduling of sample collections. Urine will be collected at enrollment and up to 36 1-month follow-up samples for characterization of microflora using high-throughput 16S rRNA phylogeny, Q-PCR and   metagenomic sequencing. STI testing will be done as well to better understand interactions between the urethral microbiome and infection. Cell phones also will be used to initiate daily sample collection for 10 days following trigger events such as specific sexual acts, antibiotic use, condom failure, or genital symptoms.

"Risk, Roles and Relationships: Project Prepared    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a two-group randomized trial of Project Prepared, an HIV/STI prevention program for youth aged 12-14. It folds together elements of three interventions we designed for middle adolescents into a comprehensive intervention that is developmentally appropriate for youth in early adolescence. Project Prepared has two parts. First is a 14-session training program held over 7 weeks that covers five major predictors of high risk behavior: developmental na¿vet¿, cognitive factors, gender roles, relationship factors and family formation. It is followed by a 5-week internship that incorporates resilience and youth development through making youth peer educators to other adolescents about HIV/STI risk. Project Prepared is theoretically based, comprehensive, intensive, and appropriate to the developmental stage, race/ethnicity, and social context of inner-city youth of color. It emphasizes skills in avoiding risky sexual situations, and provides medically accurate information about sexual development, sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy. We will conduct a two group randomized trial (n=400) to test the effectiveness of Project Prepared on cognitive factors (HIV/STI knowledge, sexual self-efficacy; intention to use a condom); relationship factors (immature romantic beliefs, relationship self-efficacy), gender norms (macho man, powerless female), and resilience. The control condition will be TEEN, an award winning program with proven effectiveness in reducing psychological symptoms with no HV/STD content.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black and Latino youth are at particular risk for HIV/STIs, but currently available interventions for young adolescents have shown only modest, short term effects.

"School Environment as a Mechanism to Reduce Youth Violence and Victimization    Description (Provided by Applicant): Youth violence imposes enormous costs on individuals and society. Youth violence is the second leading cause of death among individuals ages 10 to 24. Each year, over 720,000 youth are treated in emergency rooms for violence-related injuries (CDC, 2008a). These harms are particularly acute among minority youth. Improving school environments may serve as an effective preventative intervention because they are environmental anchors for youth and are part of the larger set of structural features of local environments linked to the prevalence of youth violence. Given that most individuals initiate violent behaviors during school years, schools provide a natural nexus in considering how to promote pro-social change within individuals and consequently reduce the prevalence of violence. Outside of the family, schools represent the most important institution of social control. Youth attending poorly-managed and resource-deprived schools are more likely to be exposed to violence, even after accounting for local community and family-related attributes. The concentration of youth on/around school grounds during the most crime prone times of the day, suggests that schools are natural ecological environments from which violence can generate. The proposed study will expand our understanding of the epidemiology of youth violence by analyzing the role of the school as a mediating protective factor. We theorize that improving the school environment is an important mediating factor in reducing aggregate rates of youth violence and victimization. Improving school environments can also putatively foster changing systemic aspects of communities linked to youth violence (e.g., disorder, social cohesion, collective efficacy). Given the lack of experimental evidence, we rely on natural experiments to generate exogenous variation in school environments and assess their effects on youth violence at multiple levels including state, districts, and schools. This approach is commonly used to estimate a causal impact on academic achievement, but has not been applied widely to youth violence outcomes. Our methodology relies on within-state, within-district and within- school variation via fixed effects regressions and, where relevant, instrumental variables and propensity score approaches to estimate the effects on youth violence. We will also disaggregate our estimates by race/ethnicity. The study will be among the first efforts to assess the effects of broad-based social policy efforts aimed at improving school environments on youth violence outcomes at state, district, and school levels. Through the analysis of surveillance data on youth violence and victimization outcomes collected by school districts, law enforcement, and public health departments, we can provide an epidemiological assessment of school effects on youth violence in the community. This project addresses the goals of Healthy People 2010 focus areas of Injury and Violence Prevention.

"HIV Prevention and Partner Abuse: Developing an Intervention for Adolescent Girls    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This K01 Career Development Award proposes to establish a rigorous academic foundation for a research career devoted to developing and testing novel interventions for reducing HIV risk for adolescents. Thematically, the K01 will address the social context of HIV risk by integrating effective theory-based adolescent HIV prevention with promising partner abuse prevention strategies, emphasizing promotion of healthy relationships. It uses family planning clinics as a venue for providing a skill-based, culturally-tailored HIV and partner abuse prevention educational and advocacy program for African American girls living is economically disadvantaged circumstances. Partner abuse, which significantly increases risk for HIV, disproportionately affects low income African-American adolescent girls, as does HIV. Critical to this project is the candidate's demonstrated ability to conduct HIV/STD research in partnership with minority communities, a long term engagement in interdisciplinary scholarship aimed at improving health and a 20- year history as a primary care provider. However, to meet her long term career objective she requires additional instruction and mentorship in 6 key areas: 1) Methods for developing theory-driven, culture- specific, developmental^ appropriate curricula in HIV prevention intervention; 2) Design and evaluation of RCT prevention programs with specific considerations for reducing HIV risk associated with partner violence among adolescent girls; 3) Advanced skills in statistical analysis, particularly techniques relevant to intervention research; 4) Study in HIV and intimate partner violence among adolescents, with special attention to racial, economic and gender disparities; 5) Responsible conduct of research with particular attention to legal and ethical considerations for adolescent HIV and partner abuse issues; 6) Manuscript preparation skills. The research plan is divided into two phases, both guided by social cognitive and gender theory. In phase 1 we will conduct focus groups and individual interviews in order to develop and tailor the HIV/partner abuse intervention for adolescent girls and in phase 2 we will evaluate the initial acceptability and feasibility of this intervention in a limited RCT. Over the 5 years of the award, instruction, training, mentorship, and applied experiences are expected to significantly enhance the candidate's skills and expertise as a researcher and also contribute greatly to launching an independent research program.           ",HIV Prevention and Partner Abuse: Developing an Intervention for Adolescent Girls,8004998,K01MH080649,"['Questionnaires ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Persons ', ' girls ', ' Mentorship ', ' Attention ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Legal ', ' Low income ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' partner violence ', ' violent partner ', ' problem, partner, abuse, violent ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Economics ', ' Instruction ', ' Scholarship ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Philadelphia ', ' next generation ', ' Gender ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Emotional ', ' Family Planning ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' relationship abuse ', ' abusive relationship ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' physical abuse ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' Provider ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' Societies ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Partner Abuse ', ' Woman ', ' social ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' career ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Teen Dating Violence ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Attitude ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' sex ', ' Minority ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' skills ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Risk ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' experience ', ' Individual ', ' Life ', ' Belief ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Award ', ' Female ', ' Injury ', ' Learning ', ' Evaluation ', ' Pattern ', ' tool ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Phase ', ' Site ', ' Advocacy ', ' Reporting ', ' Techniques ', ' Prevention program ', ' Cognitive ', ' Anger ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Control Groups ', ' United States ', ' male ', ' Behavior ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Preparation ', ' meetings ', ' Affect ', ' Health ', ' Measurement ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Communities ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' Process ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Age ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Address ', ' Training ', ' Methods ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Area ', ' Foundations ', ' Time ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Prevention ', ' Interview ', ' Accounting ', ' Family ', ' base ', ' Research ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' improved ', ' novel ', ' Testing ', ' theories ', ' programs ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Future ', ' Clinic ', ' Diagnosis ', ' condoms ', ' sexual violence ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Focus Groups ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2011,162477,0.08802253057278661
"Adapting a Social Network-based Concurrency Intervention for Kenyan Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NIH Office of AIDS Research has prioritized the development and evaluation of culturally appropriate interventions in different international settings and populations. Discovering the right prevention tools to successfully combat HIV is a global imperative with new infections outpacing treated cases by a ratio of 2:1. UNAIDS estimates that 55% of new infections occur in persons younger than 25, and has issued a global call to action for making children and adolescents central to the development and implementation of new HIV prevention efforts. This proposal meets that goal by involving adolescents and their community leaders in the adaptation of ""Know Your Network"" (KYN), an HIV prevention intervention that raises awareness about the role of concurrent (or overlapping) sexual partnerships in the spread of HIV. Kenya has an estimated 6.3% national HIV prevalence and significant disparities in the distribution of HIV across ethnic groups. HIV prevalence among Kenya's nine major ethnic groups ranges from less than 1% in the Somali to 20% in the Luo. The high prevalence of HIV infection in young Luos is particularly alarming: a recent study found the prevalence of HIV increased from 1.5% in females aged 13-14 to 8.6% in females aged 15-19, and to 33.7% for women aged 20-24. Prevalence across age cohorts increased in males more slowly, from <1% in males aged 13-19, to 10.4% in males aged 20-24, and 30% in males aged 25-29. These findings underscore the critical need for HIV prevention interventions for Luo adolescents that address the drivers of the HIV epidemic in their communities, one of which is concurrency. Study Purpose: to gain understanding of Luo adolescents' sexual partnership patterns and the sociocultural context in which they form to determine how ""Know Your Network,"" a community-based intervention, might be appropriately adapted for use as a prevention tool with this adolescent population. The study aims are to: 1) Describe Luo adolescents' sexual partnership patterns and the socio-cultural context in which they form, and identify implications for adaptations to the KYN intervention, 2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted KYN intervention for youth. Methods: Aim 1 will be accomplished by integrating a systematic review of recent scientific literature with a secondary analysis of concurrency among Luo adolescents using existing survey data collected by Amornkul et al. Aim 2 will be accomplished using focused group discussions conducted separately with adults and adolescents aged 13-17.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of illness and premature death worldwide, and has reversed gains in human development. Some populations experience a disproportionate burden of HIV infection, and it is in these populations that HIV is spreading fastest.

"CBPR to improve African American environments for youth obesity prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This U13 application responds to NICHD PAR-09-092 in the broad focus area of child, adolescent, and adult obesity. Interventions that impact upon obesity in African American children and youth, especially females, are critically needed given the steeper than average trajectory of increase and high obesity prevalence in African American children and youth, especially females. The domain of obesity research is defined here to include determinants of food, physical activity, and weight control at both environmental and individual levels and their relationships to obesity and related morbidity and mortality. This broad domain has intrinsic connections to a spectrum of potential community issues and priorities. Activities will be designed to identify the community's perceived areas of interest for addressing disparities related to obesity, with a particular focus on youth engagement. These activities will be undertaken under the rubric of the African American Collaborative Obesity Research Network (AACORN), a national organization based at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. Funds requested in this application would support engagement of youth and adult community members in planning and implementing two community-focused, national workshops, in 2010 and 2012, reflecting community priorities for social change activities related to childhood obesity prevention. Specific aims are to: 1) Implement creative new methods of enabling youth partners to share their perspectives, become more informed, and identify priorities about issues related to eating, physical activity, and body weight; 2) Create an advisory board that will stimulate dialogue among youth and adult community members and academic researchers about issues and priorities in these focus areas; 3)Identify and engage, through a memorandum of understanding, at least one youth focused, community organization as a community based participatory research (CBPR) partner; 4) With community partners and the advisory board, plan and implement a specific component of AACORN's 2010 and 2012 workshops that will provide for conjoint community and academic researcher capacity building and establish a foundation for planning longer term cross-learning and CBPR activities.

"Assessing an adherence intervention for adolescents with kidney transplants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Dr. Amaral is a pediatric nephrologist at Emory-University, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (Emory-CHOA), where she has initiated an adolescent transition clinic. She has a Masters in Health Science from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Her broad long, term career goals are to 1)become a pioneer in the development of evidence- based transitional care strategies for adolescents with chronic illness and 2)to assess and develop practices to eliminate health disparities in transplantation. Her proposed project is directed toward the first of these goals. Research: In this project, Dr. Amaral proposes to address the important problem of poor allograft survival in adolescent kidney transplant recipients due to nonadherence. Her first aim is to conduct a single center phase II randomized controlled trial that will test the effectiveness of a peer mentoring program to improve medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) versus usual care in adolescents with kidney transplants. She will measure HRQOL by written survey and medication adherence by the Brief Medication Questionnaire and pharmacy refill data. Her second aim is to determine the mechanisms by which peer mentoring impacts medication adherence and HRQOL. Specifically, she hypothesizes that peer mentoring provides social support which increases patient self-efficacy and leads to positive health outcomes. Her proposed peer-mentoring program will be telephone-based, with e-communication as deemed mutually agreeable to mentors and mentees. This approach is novel and practical, meeting patients in their ""real world."" Environment: The Emory-CHOA Pediatric Transplant Center is one of the busiest in the country, providing a rich population of patients for Dr. Amaral's single center proposal. Dr. Amaral has formed a solid team of mentors from the Dept. of Pediatrics (Dr. Larry Greenbaum), Dept. of Transplant Surgery (Dr. Allan Kirk) and School of Public Health (Dr. Arriola and Prof. Easley) to facilitate her success. Dr. Arriola has research experience with peer mentoring, having developed a program of patient navigators for African American women with breast cancer. The Rollins School of Public Health offers several relevant courses to Dr. Amaral's career development. The Department of Pediatrics is committed to the success of young investigators, providing support for statistical analysis, grantsmanship and manuscript preparation as well as opportunities to engage with the research community through the Pediatric Research Center. This project's aims are directed at improving the health of adolescents with solid organ transplants by improving medication adherence and consequently long-term allograft function. Patients who maintain functioning transplants have better quality of life and live longer than those who have failed grafts and return to dialysis. This project's aims are well matched to the NIH's mission to supportive investigative efforts to improve health and save lives.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescents with chronic disease are at increased risk for nonadherence as they become young adults. This study will compare adherence and health related quality of life outcomes in two groups of adolescents with kidney transplants: those who receive peer mentoring vs. those who do not, using a primarily telephone-based approach with e-communication tailored to the mentee's interests and resources.

"Pathways to overweight and pubertal timing in African-American and White girls    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Health disparities between African-American and white girls are evident early in life and continue over the life course. In adulthood, African-American females bear a disproportionate burden of poor health, give birth to sicker babies, and die at younger ages than white females. The persistence and depth of these disparities is recognized as a major public health problem and the elimination of these health disparities has been identified as one of the two major goals of the decade within Healthy People 2010. Despite the high national priority given to eliminating health disparities, progress towards this goal has been slow. Research has focused primarily on understanding the extent and depth of the problem and in establishing links between broad measures of social and economic factors and health disparities. Much of the research has used cross- sectional data--a design that cannot adequately examine associations between a health outcome and risk exposures that temporally preceded the observation window. Despite rapid developments in the biological sciences suggesting strong influences of early life exposures on the shaping of biological processes, few studies have investigated health disparities in light of early childhood contextual experiences. In this study, we investigate the impact of early childhood contexts on adolescent physical health using the Life Course Health Development Theory which posits that health variability is tied to the interaction of multiple contextual factors at sensitive life periods and that extraorganismic influences ""get under one's skin"" through biological processes designed to adapt to acute stress. In this theory the early contextual period starts with the mother's prepregnancy health and continues through the intrauterine and early childhood years. This is the time period that is the focus of our study. We will examine early childhood contextual factors from 4 domains using a multigenerational data base (NLSY79 Mother, Child, and Young Adult files) that has great strength in the depth and richness of contextual variables. We will examine how these contextual factors differentially impact the physical health (somatic growth, age of menarche, and self-reported general health status) of African-American and white girls in adolescence. The overall aim of this project is to determine how early life contexts differentially influence the physical health of African-American and white adolescent girls. The specific aims are: 1)To quantify and describe race differences in early childhood environmental contexts; 2)To test whether there are racial disparities in adolescent physical health in African-American and white girls matched on early childhood contextual factors. 3) To model race differences in adolescent physical health as a function of the early childhood environment and to investigate the extent to which race differences in adolescent physical health are attributable to: a) Differences in the level of available resources within contexts key to young children, b) Differences in children's health response to early environmental contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major thrust of this proposal is to understand how early childhood environments differentially influence the health of white and African-American adolescent females. The knowledge gained from this research will aid with the development of prevention and/or early intervention strategies aimed at improving the health of African-American females. The results of this study will inform practice at the individual and aggregate level, and should assist with achieving Healthy People 2010 goals to reduce the level of health disparities in minorities in this country.                 The major thrust of this proposal is to understand how early childhood environments differentially influence the health of white and African-American adolescent females.

"AMICA: Assessing Fit of Motivational Interviewing by Cultures with Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic adolescents experience more severe alcohol-related consequences due to their alcohol abuse and yet significantly fewer Hispanic adolescents receive alcohol treatment, particularly among justice-involved youth. Despite the level of research that has been conducted on motivational interviewing (MI) with mainstream samples, no published studies have investigated the efficacy of this brief, individual intervention with Hispanic adolescents. The overarching objective of this application is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief individual intervention (MI) for problem drinking behaviors with a sample of justice-involved Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents to determine if this intervention is differentially effective between Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents. Specifically, the first aim is to determine whether an MI intervention targeting alcohol abuse is effective at reducing alcohol use and related risk behavior in a sample of adolescent alcohol abusers. The second aim is to examine whether the effects of MI on problem drinking outcomes (e.g., alcohol problems, quantity of drinking, frequency of binging) are different between Hispanic versus Caucasian adolescents. Because it is important to determine the mechanisms that mediate the effects of MI and determine whether these mechanisms differ between Caucasian and Hispanic adolescents, the third aim is to examine whether group (Hispanic vs. Caucasian) moderates the meditational linkages in the overall model using a cross-groups approach to moderated mediation (Aiken, Stein, & Bentler, 1994; Bentler, 1995). To accomplish these aims, 453 Caucasian and Hispanic justice-involved alcohol abusing adolescents (ages 14-17) will be randomized to either two 60 minute MI interventions (one at baseline and a second, one week later) or an assessment only control condition (AO). All adolescents will receive behavioral assessments at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. The proposed research is expected to take a significant step towards reducing current racial/ethnic health disparities in alcohol treatment for Hispanic adolescents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the advances made in developing efficacious brief alcohol abuse interventions for mainstream adolescents, no studies have evaluated the efficacy of brief (2 session) individual alcohol abuse interventions for Hispanic adolescents. In the face of their higher need, but lower likelihood of receiving effective alcohol interventions, this research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a brief intervention, motivational interviewing (MI), with Hispanic adolescents. This research will also identify potential culturally-specific moderators in problem drinking outcomes following this brief intervention. This research will take a significant step towards reducing current racial/ethnic health disparities and improving alcohol treatment for Hispanic adolescents.           Despite the advances made in developing efficacious brief alcohol abuse interventions for mainstream adolescents, no studies have evaluated the efficacy of brief (2 session) individual alcohol abuse interventions for Hispanic adolescents.

"Boys Transitions Through Puberty    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The social norms that guide boys' transitions through puberty and young adulthood are factors associated with high risk of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Yet few methodologies exist that adequately capture these norms and interpret their influences for response and intervention. A deeper understanding of the gendered norms societies are conveying to boys as they transition through puberty, and how best to shift those norms contributing to risky behavior, is critical for protecting both young men and their future sexual partners from acquiring HIV. Although a growing body of research exists on masculinity and HIV risk, the majority of studies were not conducted in SSA, the region with the highest HIV risk for adolescents; and few to no studies engaged boys themselves as a source of recommendations for future intervention. The objective of this small research grant (R03) is to develop a research methodology for engaging adolescent boys in the process of identifying the gendered influences shaping their transitions through puberty, the ways in which such influences shape boys' and girls' vulnerabilities to HIV, and how such influences can most effectively be addressed through intervention from the perspective of boys themselves. We propose the following specific aims: 1) To develop a novel in-depth participatory and dynamic methodology for ascertaining adolescent boys'  experiences of transitioning through puberty and the gendered norms that are most influential in  shaping young men's beliefs and behaviors related to masculinity, male sexuality, gender-based  violence, and HIV risk. 2) To field test the methodology with a sample of 50 boys aged 16-19 in Tanzania in and out of school 3) To ascertain from adolescent boys the most effective approaches for shifting local masculinity norms  that put them (and their future sexual partners) at risk of HIV and other sexually-transmitted infections  (STIs), and to utilize this exploratory data for the development of an R01 intervention and evaluation  grant application.  To accomplish these aims, we propose to conduct a two-year collaborative research study with adolescent and sexual-health researchers at Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) in Tanzania. The process of developing and testing the methodology in Tanzania will provide important preliminary findings in the Tanzania setting for the conceptualization of a boy's puberty book intervention, to be developed and evaluated through an R01 application (to be submitted at the completion of this R03 study), and will also serve as a model for other SSA countries interested in understanding and addressing the gendered norms impacting on adolescent risk of HIV and other STIs within their countries.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will contribute to the multi-disciplinary effort to reduce health disparities by exploring how gendered norms are shaping adolescent boys' transitions to young adulthood, and in turn their and their sexual partners' vulnerability to infection with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. This study will develop a novel participatory methodology for conducting research with adolescent boys in sub-Saharan Africa that incorporates collecting boys' recommendations for effective intervention in addressing gendered norms leading to risky behaviors.                    This study will contribute to the multi-disciplinary effort to reduce health disparities by exploring how gendered norms are shaping adolescent boys' transitions to young adulthood, and in turn their and their sexual partners' vulnerability to infection with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.

"Adolescent Latino Sexual Behavior: More Reactive or Reasoned?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent Latino youth are more likely than their White peers to report having ever engaged in sexual intercourse, and yet are less likely to report having used a condom or alternative form of contraception during their last sexual encounter. As a result, Latino adolescents have higher rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and unintended pregnancy than their White counterparts. The overall goal of the current research and training fellowship application is prepare the applicant to become an interdisciplinary researcher who can contribute to the reduction of Latino adolescent health disparities in the domains of HIV and teen pregnancy. The specific training goals of this fellowship are: 1) to expand the applicant's knowledge of the sexual and cognitive development of adolescent youth and the sociocultural influences that shape this process for Latinos; 2) to increase the applicant's research design and quantitative analysis skills necessary to study contextual influences on Latino adolescent sexual behavior; and 3) to examine whether and how risk images, maternal- adolescent acculturation gaps, and perceptions of discrimination contribute to Latino adolescents' willingness to engage in intercourse with or without barrier or hormonal methods of contraception.  To achieve the first aim, the applicant will take courses in adolescent health and development and ethnic and racial diversity in psychology. She will also serve as a teaching assistant for a course on behavioral and psychological approaches to public health and teach a course in health or social psychology. The second aim will be accomplished via continuous engagement in activities that focus on the responsible conduct of research and the completion of statistical courses covering hierarchical linear modeling, structural equation modeling, longitudinal data analysis, and cross cultural research methods. Completion of a doctoral dissertation focusing on Latino adolescent sexual behavior will fulfill the third aim.  Using an ecological approach, the dissertation will test developmental, cultural, and mediation models of Latino adolescent sexual behavior in hopes of identifying factors amenable to preventive interventions. The developmental model will explore two developmentally-distinct pathways to Latino adolescent sexual activity: a reasoned pathway (which requires the formation of intentions), and a reactive pathway (which only requires willingness to engage in risky behavior should the opportunity arise). The cultural model will assess the impact of constructs relevant to Latino adolescents on the reactive pathway, including risk images, maternal- adolescent acculturation gaps, and perceptions of discrimination. Finally, both the developmental and cultural models will be combined in a mediation model that includes individual and social determinants of sexual behavior. Findings will be useful in the development of multilevel, theoretically-based HIV and teen pregnancy prevention interventions. The applicant is firmly committed to a research career that will contribute to the understanding and reduction of high STI, HIV, and unintended pregnancy rates among Latino adolescents.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescent Latino youth are more likely than their White peers to have ever engaged in sexual intercourse, and yet are less likely to report having used a condom or alternative form of contraception during their last sexual encounter.

"Health Disparities in Obesity: Partner Violence and its Psychosocial Pathways    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this R03 is to examine whether adolescent exposure to IPV increases risk of obesity in young adulthood and whether depressive symptoms, health behaviors or C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, mediate this relationship. Our central hypothesis is that IPV exposure in adolescence leads to increased adiposity (body mass and waist circumference) from adolescence to adulthood. We will test this hypothesis using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Among the 10,120 respondents who participated in all 4 waves of data collection, we will use structural equation modeling to examine the relationship between IPV and adiposity and whether this relationship is mediated by depressive symptoms, weight promoting health behaviors, and inflammation. We will also explore whether these direct and indirect relationships differ by race/ethnicity, sex, prior exposure to child maltreatment, and characteristics of the relationship, namely whether the violence is bi-directional (both partners use violence against the other) or uni-directional. This project supports our long-term goal of contributing evidence on the mechanisms linking early violence exposure to chronic disease in adulthood to highlight at risk populations and points of intervention at which health disparities may be mitigated.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study has high public health relevance as it will yield important information about the pathways by which intimate partner violence (IPV) may lead to obesity. IPV and obesity are both major public health problems characterized by disparities that are apparent in adolescence. Knowledge of their relationship could inform cross-cutting upstream interventions geared toward violence and obesity prevention.            The proposed study has high public health relevance as it will yield important information about the pathways by which intimate partner violence (IPV) may lead to obesity.

"Culturally-Specific HIV Prevention with Latino Adolescent Alcohol Abusers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 research and training award advances the long-term goal of reducing ethnic/racial health disparities in HIV/AIDS infection. The proposed training and research plans will enable the PI to develop the skills needed for an independent research career in this area of research. The objective of this application is to develop skills in HIV prevention research and the use of Community-Based Participatory Research and qualitative data collection methods to inform the development of an intervention which targets specific risk and protective factors associated with Hispanic adolescents' drinking and sexual risk taking behaviors. Data demonstrate that both sexual risk behaviors and alcohol use are prominent among Hispanic adolescents, and that the co- occurrence of these behaviors are directly associated with HIV/AIDS infection. Despite literature demonstrating the influence that intrapersonal factors, contextual factors, and culturally specific factors play in Hispanic adolescents' drinking and sexual risk taking behaviors, to date, no interventions addressing all three of these factors exists. This application addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a culturally specific HIV prevention intervention addressing risk and protective factors within these three domains to reduce Hispanic adolescents' risk of HIV infection. Specifically, the culturally specific intervention will include: 1) an adolescent Individual Motivational Interview (IMI) to address alcohol- and sex-related expectancies and attitudes, and alcohol refusal and safe sex behavioral intentions and self-efficacy; 2) a parent Motivational Interview to address parental monitoring and supervision and alcohol- and sex-related family communication; and, 3) an additional module designed to address acculturation conflicts between parents and adolescents, to restore the protective factors of familismo and respeto, and increase adolescents' ethnic identity and pride. A three-phase top-down research approach to adapt, refine, and pilot test the preventative intervention will be conducted. Phase I will include focus groups with Hispanic adolescents and parents and initial manual development. Phase II will include therapist training, an open pilot trial, qualitative exit interviews, and further manual revisions. Phase III will inclde a small-randomized clinical trial with 75 families recruited and randomly assigned to a culturally specific HIV prevention intervention, a standard HIV prevention intervention, or an assessment only condition. Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary indication of a reduction in HIV risk behavior and alcohol use will be examined at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. To enable the PI to pursue this long- term research agenda, she will work with experienced mentors to build four areas of expertise: (1) expertise in HIV prevention research; (2) expertise in the use of Community-Based Participatory Research methods; (3) skills for conducting qualitative research; and (4) skills in developing integrated alcohol and sexual risk interventions. This K01 addresses a key priority in HIV prevention science, and it will fully prepare the PI for an independent research career in the field.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The long-term objectives of this application include 1) reducing and eliminating health disparities in HIV infection and alcohol use disorders among ethnic/racial groups, and 2) increasing access to care among ethnic/racial groups through the development of community-based and culturally appropriate interventions.

"Urethral Microbiome of Adolescent Males  Abstract  The microflora of the anterior male urethra during adolescence is poorly described and no data address the range of ""typical"" urethral microflora during adolescence as functions of pubertal development or onset of various types of partnered sexual activity. This means that current understanding of the urethral microbiome in adolescent men rests entirely on data drawn from adults, and from epidemiologic and behavioral explanations. Marked ethnic group variation in adolescent sexual behaviors and disparity in conditions such as sexually transmitted infections (STI) justifies exploration of potential ethnic group differences in the male urethral microflora. Some research among adult males suggests important interactions between the male urethral microflora and STI, but this research has not been extended to younger men.  Here we propose to characterize the male urethral microbiome in longitudinal urine samples collected from a multi-ethnic cohort of adolescent males. Microbial flora will be assessed as function of pubertal development, sexual activity, and incident STI. Subjects will be Latino (N=24), African-American (N=24), and Euro-American (N=24) males, ages 14 - 17 at enrollment; total N=72). Participants will be recruited from an urban clinic within an area of high prevalence of STI. Socio-demographic data will be collected at enrollment. Daily behavioral and symptomologic data will be collected via cell phone, which will also be used for cohort maintenance and scheduling of sample collections. Urine will be collected at enrollment and up to 36 1-month follow-up samples for characterization of microflora using high-throughput 16s rRNA phylogeny, Q-PCR and metagenomic sequencing. STI testing will be done as well to better understand interactions between the urethral microbiome and infection. Cell phones also will be used to initiate daily sample collection for 10 days following trigger events such as specific sexual acts, antibiotic use, condom failure, or genital symptoms. The project is designed to describe the range of the normal microbiome of adolescent males, to describe the changes associated with puberty and to link the microbiome to potential health conditions such as sexually transmitted infections.",Urethral Microbiome of Adolescent Males,8321038,UH3AI094641,"['Age ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Health ', ' Circumcision ', ' Male Circumcision ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Infection ', ' human puberty ', ' Puberty ', ' Rest ', ' Technology ', ' Risk ', ' rRNA ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Phylogeny ', ' Schedule ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Clinical ', ' Normal Values ', ' Normal Range ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' urethral ', ' Urethra ', ' Urethritis ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Latino ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' improved ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Testing ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' American ', ' Oral ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' urogenital system (genital part) ', ' Genital ', ' Genital system ', ' Area ', ' Anterior ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Acute ', ' Link ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Sampling ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' microbial ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Male Urethra ', ' Male urethral structure ', ' condoms ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Behavioral ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' microbiome ', ' Data ', ' Address ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Symptoms ', ' High Prevalence ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' microbial community ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' metagenome sequencing ', ' metagenomic sequencing ', ' ']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,UH3,2012,1592532,0.02161841634392967
"Adolescent Latino Sexual Behavior: More Reactive or Reasoned?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent Latino youth are more likely than their White peers to report having ever engaged in sexual intercourse, and yet are less likely to report having used a condom or alternative form of contraception during their last sexual encounter. As a result, Latino adolescents have higher rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and unintended pregnancy than their White counterparts. The overall goal of the current research and training fellowship application is prepare the applicant to become an interdisciplinary researcher who can contribute to the reduction of Latino adolescent health disparities in the domains of HIV and teen pregnancy. The specific training goals of this fellowship are: 1) to expand the applicant's knowledge of the sexual and cognitive development of adolescent youth and the sociocultural influences that shape this process for Latinos; 2) to increase the applicant's research design and quantitative analysis skills necessary to study contextual influences on Latino adolescent sexual behavior; and 3) to examine whether and how risk images, maternal- adolescent acculturation gaps, and perceptions of discrimination contribute to Latino adolescents' willingness to engage in intercourse with or without barrier or hormonal methods of contraception.  To achieve the first aim, the applicant will take courses in adolescent health and development and ethnic and racial diversity in psychology. She will also serve as a teaching assistant for a course on behavioral and psychological approaches to public health and teach a course in health or social psychology. The second aim will be accomplished via continuous engagement in activities that focus on the responsible conduct of research and the completion of statistical courses covering hierarchical linear modeling, structural equation modeling, longitudinal data analysis, and cross cultural research methods. Completion of a doctoral dissertation focusing on Latino adolescent sexual behavior will fulfill the third aim.  Using an ecological approach, the dissertation will test developmental, cultural, and mediation models of Latino adolescent sexual behavior in hopes of identifying factors amenable to preventive interventions. The developmental model will explore two developmentally-distinct pathways to Latino adolescent sexual activity: a reasoned pathway (which requires the formation of intentions), and a reactive pathway (which only requires willingness to engage in risky behavior should the opportunity arise). The cultural model will assess the impact of constructs relevant to Latino adolescents on the reactive pathway, including risk images, maternal- adolescent acculturation gaps, and perceptions of discrimination. Finally, both the developmental and cultural models will be combined in a mediation model that includes individual and social determinants of sexual behavior. Findings will be useful in the development of multilevel, theoretically-based HIV and teen pregnancy prevention interventions. The applicant is firmly committed to a research career that will contribute to the understanding and reduction of high STI, HIV, and unintended pregnancy rates among Latino adolescents.        Adolescent Latino youth are more likely than their White peers to have ever engaged in sexual intercourse, and yet are less likely to report having used a condom or alternative form of contraception during their last sexual encounter. As a result, Latino adolescents have higher rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and unintended pregnancy than their White counterparts.

"Testing a Latino web-based parent-adolescent sexual communication intervention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latino adolescents, especially those living in Puerto Rico, are at high risk for HIV/AIDS, other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unintended pregnancies. A web-based parent communication intervention provides an opportunity to benefit adolescents by providing additional support for safer sex decisions, and to increase parents' involvement in sexual health by decreasing barriers that keep them from participating in these interventions. The purpose of this proposed study is to evaluate a brief, theoretically informed, culturally appropriate, and linguistically tailored web-based parental communication program, Cu¿dalos (""Take care of them""), designed to improve parent-adolescent sexual communication and reduce adolescent sexual risk behavior. Recent findings from an R21 RCT testing a brief computer-based version of the Cu¿dalos program indicated that the program increased parent-adolescent general communication and sexual risk communication with English and Spanish speaking U.S. Latinos.7 In this proposed study, we plan to modify the Cu¿dalos intervention by changing to a web-based format, increasing the amount of content related to sexual communication and adding a module on HIV/AIDS stigma. In this RCT, we will recruit parents (n=680) and one of their adolescents (n=680) from community-based agencies in Puerto Rico, and will be randomly assigned to receive either the parent-based Cu¿dalos intervention or a web-based health promotion control condition. Parents and adolescents will complete measures at pre-intervention and at 3-(parents only), 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. We will address the five following specific aims: 1) Does the Cu¿dalos intervention increase parents' comfort with, as well as the amount of, communication with adolescents and decrease stigma at 3-,6-, and 12- month follow-ups as compared to the general health promotion control intervention; 2) Does the Cu¿dalos intervention decrease self-reported adolescent intercourse and unprotected intercourse at the follow-ups as compared to the general health promotion control intervention; 3) Do theory-based variables (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, intentions) mediate the intervention effects of Cu¿dalos on parents' communication with their adolescents; 4) Are the effects of the Cu¿dalos intervention on adolescent sexual behavior and parent-adolescent communication moderated by individual (adolescents: sexual experience, gender, age, stigma; parents: gender, age computer access/experience, frequency and time engaged in the program), and microsystem (adolescents: parent-adolescent communication) variables; and 5) Puerto Rican and Latino youth, the lack of culturally and linguistically effectiv interventions for Latino parents and adolescents, and the absence of web-based interventions for Latinos. If the program is efficacious, the web-based format will accelerate the translation of this program into public health practice and will be an important contribution in supporting safe adolescent sexual health behaviors. Is the intervention cost-effective? This study addresses existing disparities in sexual health outcomes among        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this study will provide an important resource to parents and adolescents to support adolescents' safer sex decisions.

"Factors Associated with Teens' Non-Responsiveness to HIV Intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am committed to a career in HIV/STD prevention research. To become a fully independent investigator, I am applying for the NIMH Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) to augment my training and research in HIV/STD prevention research for vulnerable adolescents. Towards this goal, I will participate in courses, workshops, seminars, and mentoring meetings to enhance my existing knowledge and research skills, and acquire new knowledge and research skills specific to the design, implementation, adaptation and evaluation of HIV/STD prevention programs for adolescents. My proposed research plan, to be conducted at Emory University and the Fulton County Department of Health and Wellness, in Atlanta, Georgia, with the guidance of my Mentors (Primary Mentor: R. DiClemente, Co-Mentors: G. Wingood and S. Kalichman), can contribute significantly to the field of adolescent HIV prevention science in substantive and practical ways. Study 1 is a mixed-method study patterned after research conducted by my Co-Mentor (Dr. Kalichman), designed to: 1) identify the proportion of African-American female adolescents exposed to an HIV intervention that do not change their condom use, and 2) describe the personal, behavioral and psychosocial factors associated with ""failure to change"" condom use following an HIV intervention. Data from Study 1 directly informs Study 2. In Study 2, I will adapt an existing effective gender and culturally tailored adolescent HIV intervention developed by my Mentors (Dr. DiClemente, & Dr. Wingood), to enhance its efficacy for promoting condom use among African-American female adolescents who did not change their condom use after participating in an HIV intervention. The adaptation process will be guided by a sequential and systematic adaptation model, developed by Drs. Wingood and DiClemente, to facilitate the adaptation process. Study 2 is also a pilot test of the effectiveness of the adapted SiHLE intervention for this subgroup of non-responsive adolescents. The findings from the two studies in this application will make significant contributions to our understanding of adolescent sexual risk behavior and the development of effective HIV interventions which could modify the risk trajectory for HIV acquisition in hard-to-change adolescents.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV prevention interventions tailored for African-American adolescent females who are non-responsive to sexual behavior risk-reduction interventions are urgently needed as these individuals are at especially high- risk for contracting HIV/STDs. The adoption of the adapted SiHLE intervention by other health departments and community-based AIDS service organizations has the potential to reach a broad audience and a population substantially impacted by the HIV epidemic.

"HIV Prevention and Partner Abuse: Developing an Intervention for Adolescent Girls This K01 Career Development Award proposes to establish a rigorous academic foundation for a research career devoted to developing and testing novel interventions for reducing HIV risk for adolescents. Thematically, the K01 will address the social context of HIV risk by integrating effective theory-based adolescent HIV prevention with promising partner abuse prevention strategies, emphasizing promotion of healthy relationships. It uses family planning clinics as a venue for providing a skill-based, culturally-tailored HIV and partner abuse prevention educational and advocacy program for African American girls living is economically disadvantaged circumstances. Partner abuse, which significantly increases risk for HIV, disproportionately affects low income African-American adolescent girls, as does HIV. Critical to this project is the candidate's demonstrated ability to conduct HIV/STD research in partnership with minority communities, a long term engagement in interdisciplinary scholarship aimed at improving health and a 20- year history as a primary care provider. However, to meet her long term career objective she requires additional instruction and mentorship in 6 key areas: 1) Methods for developing theory-driven, culture- specific, developmental^ appropriate curricula in HIV prevention intervention; 2) Design and evaluation of RCT prevention programs with specific considerationsfor reducing HIV risk associated with partner violence among adolescent girls;3) Advanced skills in statistical analysis, particularly techniques relevant to intervention research;4) Study in HIV and intimate partner violence among adolescents, with special attention to racial, economic and gender disparities; 5) Responsible conduct of research with particular attention to legal and ethical considerations for adolescent HIV and partner abuse issues;6) Manuscript preparation skills. The research plan is divided into two phases, both guided by social cognitive and gender theory. In phase 1 we will conduct focus groups and individual interviews in order to develop and tailor the HIV/partner abuse intervention for adolescent girls and in phase 2 we will evaluate the initial acceptability and feasibility of this intervention in a limited RCT. Over the 5 years of the award, instruction, training, mentorship, and applied experiences are expected to significantly enhance the candidate's skills and expertise as a researcher and also contribute greatly to launching an independent research program.

"How economic and neighborhood factors modify effects of school obesity policies     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for the Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) for Dr. Daniel Taber, a postdoctoral research associate at the Institute for Health Research and Policy (IHRP) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Dr. Taber is a young investigator who specializes in studying the effects of school- based policies that are designed to improve diet and reduce obesity among children. He also specializes in studying racial/ethnic disparities in school policy effectiveness. The K99/R00 award will enable him to expand his policy research to sectors outside of school, as he examines how economic, environmental, and policy measures in the community (e.g., taxes, zoning laws) modify the effects of school-based legislation. His proposed research includes system dynamics modeling designed to simulate the comprehensive effect of policies in different sectors. Many experts have recommended applying systems science to obesity policy research, but the application of systems science has been largely theoretical. Dr. Taber received introductory training in system dynamics at the 2011 Institute on Systems Science and Health (ISSH) and is now proposing to pursue in-depth training in this field. His proposed training will include: 1) formal coursework in system dynamics, 2) one-on-one training in economic and environment policy initiatives, and 3) one-on-one training in economic methods of studying disparities and policy initiatives. To achieve these goals, he has assembled a mentoring team with expertise in public policy (Dr. Jamie Chriqui, UIC), economics (Dr. Frank Chaloupka, UIC), and system dynamics (Dr. Hazhir Rahmandad, Virginia Tech). Dr. Chriqui and Dr. Chaloupka have decades of experience studying economic and environmental policies related to substance abuse, and are currently conducting ground-breaking research to study whether such policies can prevent obesity. Dr. Rahmandad was Dr. Taber's instructor at ISSH, earned his PhD in system dynamics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and is currently conducting obesity research to study the dynamics of energy balance. Dr. Taber's mentors will guide him through his proposed research, in which he will study whether economic and environmental characteristics in the community modify the effects of school-based policies (Aims 1 and 2), analyze whether such characteristics contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in weight status and policy effectiveness (Aim 3), and appl system dynamics to analyze the impact that policy initiatives in different sectors have on diet, weight status, and racial/ethnic disparities in weight status among adolescents (Aim 4). This research will form the basis of an R01 application in which he will design more intensive system dynamics research to study the effects of obesity policies, and he will complete this application by the end of the R00 phase of this award. Public health relevance Adolescent obesity is a substantial public health and economic burden in the United States, and the burden is likely to worsen as the U.S. population ages. Research consistently suggests that the effects of school-based policies are too weak to prevent adolescent obesity. Obesity policy research must expand outside of school to determine if policies that target the broader economic and environmental determinants of obesity are more effective.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescent obesity is a substantial public health and economic burden in the United States, and the burden is likely to worsen as the U.S. population ages.

"Daily Experiences of School Bullying and Cyberbullying: Effects on Latino Youth     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  School bullying (e.g., name calling, physical threats) is a significant social and health concern associated with maladaptive mental health and academic outcomes (e.g., Juvonen, Graham, & Schuster, 2003; Juvonen, Wang, & Espinoza, 2011). With the growing use of electronic communication tools among adolescents, bullying encounters are no longer limited to the school grounds but are becoming increasingly more common online (i.e., via electronic communication), before and after school. Both school bullying and cyberbullying experiences are considerable sources of stress in adolescent's everyday lives and as such, these incidents are a significant public health concern. Due to the rapid increase of online communication use and as cyberbullying rates are escalating, it is important to examine the ways in which cyberbullying may (or may not) differ from school bullying. Two studies will examine the everyday school bullying and cyberbullying experiences of urban, Latino adolescents. Existing research on cyberbullying has predominately focused on White youth, thus, little is known about cyberbullying among ethnic minority youth. Yet, the gap in Internet use between Latino and White adolescents in particular, has declined considerably and Latinos are now more likely to connect online wirelessly (Livingston, Parker, & Fox, 2009). Moreover, given that Latino teens are at elevated risk of mental health problems such as depression and of performing poorly in school (e.g., Joiner et al., 2001, Kohler & Lazarin, 2007), it is important to know whether these negative peer experiences increase their risk for mental health and school problems. The proposed research will rely on daily diary methods that are rarely used in school bullying research and that remain unused in cyberbullying research. Daily methodology is described as a useful tool for ""capturing life as it is lived"" (Bolger, Davis, & Rafaeli, 2003) and allows for the examination of both individual-level and daily-level associations. The two studies will specifically test whether school bullying and cyberbullying experiences are related to mental health problems and compromised school adjustment. In addition, given that little is known about cyberbullying, this study aims to identify possible mediating and moderating mechanisms and will probe more deeply into specific conditions in which cyberbullying may be particularly consequential. A research training program has been designed that includes coursework (e.g., advanced multilevel modeling, mental health disparities, ethical research conduct), attendance of seminars and scientific conferences (e.g., American Public Health Association), individualized meetings with my co-Sponsors who are leading experts in bullying research and daily diary methods and unique opportunities such as attending quantitative training programs. This training program will ensure that the goals of the proposed research are executed successfully and in a timely manner.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bullying incidents are a growing problem that adolescents are faced with both at school and online. School bullying and cyberbullying (i.e., bullying that occurs via electronic communication tools) experiences are a considerable source of stress in adolescents' everyday lives and as such, these incidents are a significant public health concern.

"Sleep, Obesity and the Well-Being of US Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the obesity epidemic is ubiquitous in its reach, large disparities in obesity prevalence have nevertheless been observed among U.S. adolescents from different gender, racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Several explanations for these disparities have been proposed, but research has yet to adequately explore the role of sleep duration in creating disparities in obesity prevalence. Because (1) sleep is a known risk factor for weight gain, and (2) sleep habits vary by gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, research in this area promises to improve our understanding of obesity disparities. Disparities in obesity prevalence are a major public health concern, in part because obesity has been implicated as a risk factor for suboptimal physical and psychosocial well-being. Research has consistently shown that obese adolescents are substantially more likely than their healthy weight peers to report poor general health and physical functioning. Although studies have reported less consistent findings with regard to the psychosocial impact of obesity, some studies have also found impaired mental and social well-being among obese adolescents. Like obesity, sleep is also known to influence physical and psychological functioning. However, to date research has yet to explore how short sleep duration could amplify the adverse effects of obesity on adolescent well-being. Three major aims of our proposed analyses follow: Aim 1. Examine how sleep duration influences disparities in obesity that have been observed among groups of U.S. adolescents categorized by gender, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). Aim 2. Develop and test a theoretical model of physical and psychosocial well-being among U.S. adolescents, where sleep moderates the direct impact of body mass. Aim 3. Examine whether the model developed in Aim 2 varies by gender, race/ethnicity and SES. To achieve these aims, we will utilize data from multiple waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally representative study of U.S. adolescents in grades 7-12 in 1994-95. Add Health has followed this cohort of Americans into young adulthood, with the most recent wave of data collection occurring in 2008. With clinical measures of height and weight, repeated measures of sleep duration and quality, and a wide assortment of socioeconomic, demographic, psychological, and health indicators, Add Health is ideally suited for our research agenda. Our analyses will employ a number of advanced statistical techniques. For instance, to test a model of adolescent well-being (Aim 2), we will estimate a series of structural equation models that provide an empirical test of our theoretical expectations.        The prevalence of obesity and short sleep duration has increased among U.S. adolescents. To facilitate the development of programs and policies in education and public health that will improve the lives of young Americans, it is important to understand (a) how sleep patterns influence disparities in obesity across different gender, racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups, and (b) how obesity and sleep synergistically affect the physical and psychosocial well-being of adolescents in the U.S. Through the analysis of data from multiple waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, our research promises to make progress on both of these fronts.

"Family Aggression & Trajectories of Adolescent Adaptation: Bioregulatory Effect     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aggressive marital conflict and harsh parenting (family aggression) are highly prevalent. Chronic exposure to family aggression elevates adolescents' risk for antisocial and risky behavior, depressed mood, and cognitive decrements - significant public health problems that increase in prevalence and severity during adolescence. Explaining variability in trajectories of adaptation in the context of family aggression - why some adolescent's exhibit resilience and others deteriorate - is a critical need for science and practice. Findings stemming from the proposed study will illuminate autonomic nervous system activity and sleep regulation variables (bioregulatory processes), as well as economic and social context (peer affiliation) variables, which may mediate the risk of family aggression or operate to exacerbate or protect against its effects on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral maladjustment from late childhood through late adolescence. The design builds on a well-characterized 3-wave study; children ranged between 8-11 years across waves. The proposed study will involve 3 additional waves with a 1-year lag: 50% girls, ~14-15 years at T4, with high representation of both African-American and lower SES families. Study constructs are assessed with multiple informants and measures. Sleep parameters are examined objectively, via actigraphy, and subjectively. ANS activity (sympathetic and parasympathetic) is measured with standard indices, and reactivity is assessed with well-established lab procedures. The large and diverse sample, breadth of measurement across important adolescent outcome domains, and a 6-wave longitudinal design will permit analyses of long- term developmental trajectories, interactions among biopsychosocial processes, and profiles of family, bioregulatory and socioecological risk. The proposed study will create new knowledge in areas of great significance through investigations of bioregularoty and socioecological variables that have the potential to enhance understanding of risk among adolescents exposed to family aggression and to identify physiological, behavioral, and ecological targets for intervention. Outcome variables include public health priorities, such as behavioral and emotional adjustment, academic performance (PA-07-046, Research on Mind-Body Interactions and Health), violence (PA-09-169, Research on Teen Dating Violence), and sleep disturbances (PA-07-140, Research on Sleep and Sleep Disorders). Hypotheses will be tested across a wide range of socioecological contexts with a diverse community sample (PA-07-379, Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities). Other key strengths include our focus on estimating trajectories of adolescent functioning across multiple domains; considering the direction of effects between constructs; and comparing the strength of associations at different time points across development.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive marital conflict and harsh parenting are highly prevalent and elevate adolescents' risk for antisocial and risky behavior, depressed mood, and cognitive decrements- significant public health problems that increase in prevalence and severity during adolescence. However, the potential effects of bioregulatory and socioecological variables on trajectories of adolescent adjustment in the context of family aggression are not well understood.

"CBPR to improve African American environments for youth obesity prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This U13 application responds to NICHD PAR-09-092 in the broad focus area of child, adolescent, and adult obesity. Interventions that impact upon obesity in African American children and youth, especially females, are critically needed given the steeper than average trajectory of increase and high obesity prevalence in African American children and youth, especially females. The domain of obesity research is defined here to include determinants of food, physical activity, and weight control at both environmental and individual levels and their relationships to obesity and related morbidity and mortality. This broad domain has intrinsic connections to a spectrum of potential community issues and priorities. Activities will be designed to identify the community's perceived areas of interest for addressing disparities related to obesity, with a particular focus on youth engagement. These activities will be undertaken under the rubric of the African American Collaborative Obesity Research Network (AACORN), a national organization based at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. Funds requested in this application would support engagement of youth and adult community members in planning and implementing two community-focused, national workshops, in 2010 and 2012, reflecting community priorities for social change activities related to childhood obesity prevention. Specific aims are to: 1) Implement creative new methods of enabling youth partners to share their perspectives, become more informed, and identify priorities about issues related to eating, physical activity, and body weight; 2) Create an advisory board that will stimulate dialogue among youth and adult community members and academic researchers about issues and priorities in these focus areas; 3)Identify and engage, through a memorandum of understanding, at least one youth focused, community organization as a community based participatory research (CBPR) partner; 4) With community partners and the advisory board, plan and implement a specific component of AACORN's 2010 and 2012 workshops that will provide for conjoint community and academic researcher capacity building and establish a foundation for planning longer term cross-learning and CBPR activities.

"School Environment as a Mechanism to Reduce Youth Violence and Victimization    Description (Provided by Applicant): Youth violence imposes enormous costs on individuals and society. Youth violence is the second leading cause of death among individuals ages 10 to 24. Each year, over 720,000 youth are treated in emergency rooms for violence-related injuries (CDC, 2008a). These harms are particularly acute among minority youth. Improving school environments may serve as an effective preventative intervention because they are environmental anchors for youth and are part of the larger set of structural features of local environments linked to the prevalence of youth violence. Given that most individuals initiate violent behaviors during school years, schools provide a natural nexus in considering how to promote pro-social change within individuals and consequently reduce the prevalence of violence. Outside of the family, schools represent the most important institution of social control. Youth attending poorly-managed and resource-deprived schools are more likely to be exposed to violence, even after accounting for local community and family-related attributes. The concentration of youth on/around school grounds during the most crime prone times of the day, suggests that schools are natural ecological environments from which violence can generate. The proposed study will expand our understanding of the epidemiology of youth violence by analyzing the role of the school as a mediating protective factor. We theorize that improving the school environment is an important mediating factor in reducing aggregate rates of youth violence and victimization. Improving school environments can also putatively foster changing systemic aspects of communities linked to youth violence (e.g., disorder, social cohesion, collective efficacy). Given the lack of experimental evidence, we rely on natural experiments to generate exogenous variation in school environments and assess their effects on youth violence at multiple levels including state, districts, and schools. This approach is commonly used to estimate a causal impact on academic achievement, but has not been applied widely to youth violence outcomes. Our methodology relies on within-state, within-district and within- school variation via fixed effects regressions and, where relevant, instrumental variables and propensity score approaches to estimate the effects on youth violence. We will also disaggregate our estimates by race/ethnicity. The study will be among the first efforts to assess the effects of broad-based social policy efforts aimed at improving school environments on youth violence outcomes at state, district, and school levels. Through the analysis of surveillance data on youth violence and victimization outcomes collected by school districts, law enforcement, and public health departments, we can provide an epidemiological assessment of school effects on youth violence in the community. This project addresses the goals of Healthy People 2010 focus areas of Injury and Violence Prevention.

"AMICA: Assessing Fit of Motivational Interviewing by Cultures with Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic adolescents experience more severe alcohol-related consequences due to their alcohol abuse and yet significantly fewer Hispanic adolescents receive alcohol treatment, particularly among justice-involved youth. Despite the level of research that has been conducted on motivational interviewing (MI) with mainstream samples, no published studies have investigated the efficacy of this brief, individual intervention with Hispanic adolescents. The overarching objective of this application is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief individual intervention (MI) for problem drinking behaviors with a sample of justice-involved Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents to determine if this intervention is differentially effective between Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents. Specifically, the first aim is to determine whether an MI intervention targeting alcohol abuse is effective at reducing alcohol use and related risk behavior in a sample of adolescent alcohol abusers. The second aim is to examine whether the effects of MI on problem drinking outcomes (e.g., alcohol problems, quantity of drinking, frequency of binging) are different between Hispanic versus Caucasian adolescents. Because it is important to determine the mechanisms that mediate the effects of MI and determine whether these mechanisms differ between Caucasian and Hispanic adolescents, the third aim is to examine whether group (Hispanic vs. Caucasian) moderates the meditational linkages in the overall model using a cross-groups approach to moderated mediation (Aiken, Stein, & Bentler, 1994; Bentler, 1995). To accomplish these aims, 453 Caucasian and Hispanic justice-involved alcohol abusing adolescents (ages 14-17) will be randomized to either two 60 minute MI interventions (one at baseline and a second, one week later) or an assessment only control condition (AO). All adolescents will receive behavioral assessments at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. The proposed research is expected to take a significant step towards reducing current racial/ethnic health disparities in alcohol treatment for Hispanic adolescents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the advances made in developing efficacious brief alcohol abuse interventions for mainstream adolescents, no studies have evaluated the efficacy of brief (2 session) individual alcohol abuse interventions for Hispanic adolescents. In the face of their higher need, but lower likelihood of receiving effective alcohol interventions, this research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a brief intervention, motivational interviewing (MI), with Hispanic adolescents. This research will also identify potential culturally-specific moderators in problem drinking outcomes following this brief intervention. This research will take a significant step towards reducing current racial/ethnic health disparities and improving alcohol treatment for Hispanic adolescents.

"Mexican-origin Teen Moms, Their Infants, and Mother Figures: Health & Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will examine how developmental, family, cultural, and economic factors interact to inform the health and development of two groups of children who are disproportionately at risk for negative health outcomes:  Mexican-origin adolescent mothers and their young children. Adolescent females of Mexican origin have the highest national birthrate, and it is over twice the overall national rate (National Vital Statistics Report, 2005).  Because children of adolescent mothers are at increased risk for negative outcomes (Chandra, Schivello, Ravi, Weinstein, & Hook, 2002) and adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning has been identified as a predictor of children's health and development (Carothers, Borkowski, Lefever, & Whitman, 2005), it is critical to examine the factors that inform adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning, their parenting behaviors, and in turn, their children's health and development. We propose to build on our study of Mexican-origin adolescent mothers, their mothers or mother figures (referred to in our study as the female family member; FFM), and their infants, which involved data gathered from adolescents and FFMs during the adolescents' third trimester of pregnancy (Wave 1), and from adolescent mothers, FFMs, and infants when infants were 10 months of age (Wave 2) and again when infants were 24 months of age (Wave 3). We propose to collect three additional points of measurement from all three family members in the 206 families who participated in the original project (N = 618).  This longitudinal, multi-generational study will capture cultural, family, and developmental processes and outcomes for a) adolescent mothers and FFMs over a five-year period beginning when adolescent mothers are in middle/late adolescence (i.e., 15-18 years of age) through emerging adulthood (20-23 years of age), and b) their young children from infancy (i.e., 10 months) through early childhood (i.e., 5 yrs of age). Specific aims are  to examine (1) the linkages between trajectories of two normative developmental processes (i.e., ethnic identity,  autonomy) and trajectories of Mexican-origin adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning (e.g., depressive  symptoms) from middle/late adolescence through emerging adulthood, and to identify family, peer, and cultural  characteristics that moderate these associations; (2) how family (i.e., mother-adolescent conflict), economic  (i.e., economic hardship), and cultural (i.e., acculturative stress and discrimination) stressors are linked to  adolescent mothers' trajectories of psychosocial functioning, and to investigate the family, peer, and cultural  characteristics that moderate these associations; and (3) how trajectories of adolescent mothers' psychosocial  functioning predict their parenting behaviors and, in turn, trajectories of their children's health and development;  we also will test family, peer, and cultural characteristics that moderate these associations. A focus on Mexican-  origin children is critical because Latinos (of which Mexican-origin are a majority) are repeatedly identified as an  at-risk population for negative health and behavioral outcomes and, in fact, show substantial risk for  maladjustment in almost all leading health indicators identified by Healthy People 2010 (CDC, 2008).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latinos show greater risk for maladjustment in almost all of the leading health indicators identified by Healthy  People 2010 (CDC, 2008) and bear a disproportionate burden of disease, injury, death, and disability in the  U.S. (CDC, 2004a). Furthermore, Mexican-origin adolescent females lead the nation in rates of teen pregnancy (with rates over twice the national average; National Vital Statistics Report, 2005). This research will contribute significantly to understanding how to promote positive health and development among Mexican-origin adolescent mothers and their young children, which is in line with the Surgeon General's call to address health disparities among Latinos and other ethnic minorities (U.S. Surgeon General, 2008).

"Assessing an adherence intervention for adolescents with kidney transplants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Dr. Amaral is a pediatric nephrologist at Emory-University, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (Emory-CHOA), where she has initiated an adolescent transition clinic. She has a Masters in Health Science from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Her broad long, term career goals are to 1)become a pioneer in the development of evidence- based transitional care strategies for adolescents with chronic illness and 2)to assess and develop practices to eliminate health disparities in transplantation. Her proposed project is directed toward the first of these goals. Research: In this project, Dr. Amaral proposes to address the important problem of poor allograft survival in adolescent kidney transplant recipients due to nonadherence. Her first aim is to conduct a single center phase II randomized controlled trial that will test the effectiveness of a peer mentoring program to improve medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) versus usual care in adolescents with kidney transplants. She will measure HRQOL by written survey and medication adherence by the Brief Medication Questionnaire and pharmacy refill data. Her second aim is to determine the mechanisms by which peer mentoring impacts medication adherence and HRQOL. Specifically, she hypothesizes that peer mentoring provides social support which increases patient self-efficacy and leads to positive health outcomes. Her proposed peer-mentoring program will be telephone-based, with e-communication as deemed mutually agreeable to mentors and mentees. This approach is novel and practical, meeting patients in their ""real world."" Environment: The Emory-CHOA Pediatric Transplant Center is one of the busiest in the country, providing a rich population of patients for Dr. Amaral's single center proposal. Dr. Amaral has formed a solid team of mentors from the Dept. of Pediatrics (Dr. Larry Greenbaum), Dept. of Transplant Surgery (Dr. Allan Kirk) and School of Public Health (Dr. Arriola and Prof. Easley) to facilitate her success. Dr. Arriola has research experience with peer mentoring, having developed a program of patient navigators for African American women with breast cancer. The Rollins School of Public Health offers several relevant courses to Dr. Amaral's career development. The Department of Pediatrics is committed to the success of young investigators, providing support for statistical analysis, grantsmanship and manuscript preparation as well as opportunities to engage with the research community through the Pediatric Research Center. This project's aims are directed at improving the health of adolescents with solid organ transplants by improving medication adherence and consequently long-term allograft function. Patients who maintain functioning transplants have better quality of life and live longer than those who have failed grafts and return to dialysis. This project's aims are well matched to the NIH's mission to supportive investigative efforts to improve health and save lives.     Adolescents with chronic disease are at increased risk for nonadherence as they become young adults. This study will compare adherence and health related quality of life outcomes in two groups of adolescents with kidney transplants: those who receive peer mentoring vs. those who do not, using a primarily telephone-based approach with e-communication tailored to the mentee's interests and resources.

"PS11-003 Minority AIDS Research Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed study aims to address health disparities between Hispanic and non-Hispanic whites, particularly as it relates to HIV and drug use in Hispanic adolescents. This goal will be accomplished by two aims: AIM I is to develop an Internet-based version of the face-to-face Familias Unidas intervention (hereafter referred to as Internet-Based Familias Unidas); and AIM II is to evaluate the efficacy of Internet-Based Familias Unidas, relative to both face-to-face Familias Unidas and a community practice control condition, in preventing unprotected sexual behavior and drug use in a community sample of Hispanic adolescents living in Miami-Dade County. 270 Hispanic adolescents recruited from three high schools will be randomized using an urn design to one of three conditions: Internet-Based Familias Unidas, face-to-face Familias Unidas or Community Practice. Face-to-face Familias Unidas, a Hispanic-specific, family- centered intervention, has been found efficacious, relative to control conditions, in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior and drug use in two randomized clinical trials (Pantin et al., 2009; Prado et al., 2007).  Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Internet-Based Familias Unidas and face-to-face Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than Community Practice Control in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior over time; (H2) Internet-Based Familias Unidas and face-to-face Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than Community Practice Control in preventing adolescent drug use over time; (H3) Internet-Based Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than face-to-face Familias Unidas in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior over time; and (H4) Internet-Based Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than face-to-face Familias Unidas in preventing adolescent drug use over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Internet-Based Familias Unidas and face-to-face Familias Unidas on adolescent unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H2a) the effect of Internet-Based Familias Unidas and face-to- face Familias Unidas on adolescent drug use will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H3a) the effect of Internet-Based Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by participation rates; and (H4a) the effect of Internet-Based Familias Unidas on adolescent drug use will be partially mediated by participation rates.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the proposed study is to prevent and reduce HIV risk behaviors among Hispanic adolescents.

"Investigating Adverse Effects of Adolescent Group Interventions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project seeks to examine adverse effects of group interventions on adolescents' externalizing behavior. Group interventions represent one of the most economical, convenient, and common solution to adolescent behavior problems, a major dilemma for our society that accounts for the greatest number of referrals to mental health clinics. Findings from program evaluation studies have begun to suggest that these groups unexpectedly increase the externalizing behaviors that they were designed to reduce or prevent. However, research has yet to verify whether these unexpected findings represent a meaningful, significant, and lasting adverse effect on adolescent participants rather than a methodologically-driven empirical artifact. Further research based on a strong research design and longitudinal data is necessary to make this important distinction. This project integrates clinical, developmental, and quantitative approaches to investigate a previously discovered adverse effect of an adolescent group intervention. The current study will draw data from a longitudinal, multi-site randomized controlled trial of the Bridges to High School / Puentes a La Secund¿ria Program, a culturally competent, multicomponent prevention program designed to reduce risk during the middle school transition, which has demonstrated positive effects across an array of outcomes. Data were collected at the beginning of 7th grade, with follow-up data collected at the end of the 7th,8th, 9th, and 12th grade from a sample of primarily low-income Mexican American adolescents and their mothers. These data will allow the opportunity to examine intervention effects on long-term outcomes, trajectories of externalizing behaviors across adolescence, and potential mediators of observed effects, each of which provide critical and unique information on the development and prevention of externalizing problems among adolescents.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine whether adverse effects of adolescent group interventions, which have been found in 24-29% of evaluation studies, are lasting and clinically significant and seeks to identify the processes that explain them. In addition, this stuy reflects the current priority among researchers to refine innovative prevention strategies that are personalized for optimal use among underserved populations, such as Mexican Americans (MAs), the fastest growing US minority group who face substantial health disparities. Investigating the risk and cultural factors that might influence intervention responses among MA youth is necessary to reduce these disparities and their long-term personal and public health burden and strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported research.                 This study will examine whether adverse effects of adolescent group interventions, which have been found in 24-29% of evaluation studies, are lasting and clinically significant and seeks to identify the processes that explain them.

"Daily Experience in Adolescence and Biomarkers of Early Risk for Adult Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite calls for the identification of early risk factors for the development of chronic health conditions, there has been little longitudinal research on biomarkers of health that has been conducted in persons younger than 25 years of age. In addition, there is only a minimal understanding of how biological indices of early risk for adult health develop among adolescents with Latin American and Asian backgrounds, the two fastest rising ethnic groups in the United States, who are at differential risk for adverse health outcomes as compared to European Americans. An understanding of these processes is necessary for the development of ethnically and culturally relevant prevention efforts.  We propose a 3-wave longitudinal study of adolescents and their caregivers from Mexican, Chinese and European backgrounds in order to assess the impact of daily experience on biological indicators of early risk for adult health. Our focus on daily experience stems from the need to identify the mechanisms by which global social factors identified in demographic surveys, such as lower education and income, play themselves out in individuals' daily lives. Daily experiences such as social conflict, excessive demands, emotional distress, threat, and sleep behaviors have been shown to be linked to both global risk factors and multiple biological indices of health risk among adults.  The project will include both intensive behavioral assessments and detailed biological markers of health risk from both adolescents and their parents in order to address the following specific aims: (1) describe the development during adolescence of biological indices of early risk for adult health; (2) assess the role of daily experience in the development of early health risk; (3) examine the existence of ethnic disparities in early health risk; and (4) explore the role of potential protective factors in the development of early health risk.  Approximately 540 pairs of adolescents and primary caregivers (180 from each ethnic group) will be assessed when the adolescents are approximately 15-16, 17-18, and 19-20 years of age. Each year, both adolescents and caregivers will participate in interviews that include measures of global social factors such as socioeconomic background and potential protective factors such as social connectedness. Participants will report daily experiences using a nightly diary checklist for 9 consecutive days. Salivary cortisol will be obtained at 4 time points each day for 4 of these days in order to analyze HPA activity, and participants will wear wrist actigraphs for the same 4 days to measure objective sleep behaviors. Blood pressure, BMI, and waist/hip ratio will be assessed, and dried blood spots will be obtained for the assessment of c-reactive-protein (CRP), cholesterol, and high density lipoproteins (HDL). Finally, peripheral blood samples will be provided by a subsample of 120 families for the assessment of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and for gene expression analyses of molecular signaling pathways driving inflammatory biology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is only a minimal understanding of how biological indices of early risk for adult health develop among adolescents with Latin American and Asian backgrounds, the two fastest rising ethnic groups in the United States, who are at differential risk for adverse health outcomes as compared to European American. More in-depth examinations of the daily lives of adolescents from these populations could identify both the sources of these disparities as well as unique risk and protective factors.

"Adapting a Social Network-based Concurrency Intervention for Kenyan Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NIH Office of AIDS Research has prioritized the development and evaluation of culturally appropriate interventions in different international settings and populations. Discovering the right prevention tools to successfully combat HIV is a global imperative with new infections outpacing treated cases by a ratio of 2:1. UNAIDS estimates that 55% of new infections occur in persons younger than 25, and has issued a global call to action for making children and adolescents central to the development and implementation of new HIV prevention efforts. This proposal meets that goal by involving adolescents and their community leaders in the adaptation of ""Know Your Network"" (KYN), an HIV prevention intervention that raises awareness about the role of concurrent (or overlapping) sexual partnerships in the spread of HIV. Kenya has an estimated 6.3% national HIV prevalence and significant disparities in the distribution of HIV across ethnic groups. HIV prevalence among Kenya's nine major ethnic groups ranges from less than 1% in the Somali to 20% in the Luo. The high prevalence of HIV infection in young Luos is particularly alarming: a recent study found the prevalence of HIV increased from 1.5% in females aged 13-14 to 8.6% in females aged 15-19, and to 33.7% for women aged 20-24. Prevalence across age cohorts increased in males more slowly, from <1% in males aged 13-19, to 10.4% in males aged 20-24, and 30% in males aged 25-29. These findings underscore the critical need for HIV prevention interventions for Luo adolescents that address the drivers of the HIV epidemic in their communities, one of which is concurrency. Study Purpose: to gain understanding of Luo adolescents' sexual partnership patterns and the sociocultural context in which they form to determine how ""Know Your Network,"" a community-based intervention, might be appropriately adapted for use as a prevention tool with this adolescent population. The study aims are to: 1) Describe Luo adolescents' sexual partnership patterns and the socio-cultural context in which they form, and identify implications for adaptations to the KYN intervention, 2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted KYN intervention for youth. Methods: Aim 1 will be accomplished by integrating a systematic review of recent scientific literature with a secondary analysis of concurrency among Luo adolescents using existing survey data collected by Amornkul et al. Aim 2 will be accomplished using focused group discussions conducted separately with adults and adolescents aged 13-17.         HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of illness and premature death worldwide, and has reversed gains in human development. Some populations experience a disproportionate burden of HIV infection, and it is in these populations that HIV is spreading fastest. This project involves Kenyan adolescents, their families, and community in the adaptation of a new HIV prevention intervention for use adolescents at high risk of HIV infection.

"AMICA: Assessing Fit of Motivational Interviewing by Cultures with Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic adolescents experience more severe alcohol-related consequences due to their alcohol abuse and yet significantly fewer Hispanic adolescents receive alcohol treatment, particularly among justice-involved youth. Despite the level of research that has been conducted on motivational interviewing (MI) with mainstream samples, no published studies have investigated the efficacy of this brief, individual intervention with Hispanic adolescents. The overarching objective of this application is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief individual intervention (MI) for problem drinking behaviors with a sample of justice-involved Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents to determine if this intervention is differentially effective between Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents. Specifically, the first aim is to determine whether an MI intervention targeting alcohol abuse is effective at reducing alcohol use and related risk behavior in a sample of adolescent alcohol abusers. The second aim is to examine whether the effects of MI on problem drinking outcomes (e.g., alcohol problems, quantity of drinking, frequency of binging) are different between Hispanic versus Caucasian adolescents. Because it is important to determine the mechanisms that mediate the effects of MI and determine whether these mechanisms differ between Caucasian and Hispanic adolescents, the third aim is to examine whether group (Hispanic vs. Caucasian) moderates the meditational linkages in the overall model using a cross-groups approach to moderated mediation (Aiken, Stein, & Bentler, 1994; Bentler, 1995). To accomplish these aims, 453 Caucasian and Hispanic justice-involved alcohol abusing adolescents (ages 14-17) will be randomized to either two 60 minute MI interventions (one at baseline and a second, one week later) or an assessment only control condition (AO). All adolescents will receive behavioral assessments at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. The proposed research is expected to take a significant step towards reducing current racial/ethnic health disparities in alcohol treatment for Hispanic adolescents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the advances made in developing efficacious brief alcohol abuse interventions for mainstream adolescents, no studies have evaluated the efficacy of brief (2 session) individual alcohol abuse interventions for Hispanic adolescents. In the face of their higher need, but lower likelihood of receiving effective alcohol interventions, this research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a brief intervention, motivational interviewing (MI), with Hispanic adolescents. This research will also identify potential culturally-specific moderators in problem drinking outcomes following this brief intervention. This research will take a significant step towards reducing current racial/ethnic health disparities and improving alcohol treatment for Hispanic adolescents.

"Technology to connect at-risk youth to testing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among the numerous health disparities disproportionately burdening people of color, HIV/AIDS is among the highest. In the African American community the HIV/AIDS epidemic is one of the most urgent public health issues. In order to address the health disparity in HIV/AIDS, detection of HIV in the African American community is crucial. The benefits for early detection of HIV include potentially prolonged duration and quality of life for those living with the virus. HIV testing has also been proposed as a HIV preventive strategy. Detection of HIV has a number of potential preventive benefits, including reduced transmission risk behaviors by those infected9 and reduced viral load by those taking antiretroviral medications, whereby potentially reducing transmission. The proposed study makes a significant public health impact by developing and pilot testing an innovative strategy to increase the number of high-risk adolescents receiving HIV screening. In response to PA-09-146 (Pilot and Feasibility Studies in Preparation for Drug Abuse Prevention Trials [r34]), we propose a pilot study to examine the acceptability and feasibility of a peer-driven, HIV-testing campaign. Peer education and outreach strategies have been successful at reducing sexual risk behavior and increasing the use of health resources in adolescents and other at-risk groups, including adults residing in census tracts where STI rates are high. A potential vehicle for outreach to adolescents is socially interactive technologies (e.g., text messages). The proposed study makes a scientific impact in examining the effectiveness of messaging diffused through the social network of adolescents. A total of 100 current patients at an urban adolescent health clinic serving predominately African Americans will be recruited to disseminate at least 5 text messages to friends they believe are sexually active. Youth will be provided with a brief guide to help them develop their messages. The youth generated text messages will encourage their friends to visit the clinic and get tested. The specific aims of this project are to: Aim 1: Develop protocols and a theory-informed message guide for a peer-driven text message intervention for adolescents recruited from an adolescent health clinic. Aim 2: Examine the acceptability and feasibility of sending text messages related to obtaining HIV/STI testing. We will obtain participant feedback and examine the recruitment rate, number of youth failing to meet inclusion criteria, number of youth verified to have sent text messages, and number of text messages sent. We will also obtain feedback from the clinic providers regarding impact on patient and services flow, provider reactions, and impact on clinical visit. Aim 3: Preliminarily examine the efficacy of a youth generated messaging intervention to increase the: 1) number of high-risk youth seeking services and 2) clinic volume as measured by: a) number of new patients at clinic, b) increase in rate of new patient appointments, and c) number of STI tests conducted. If successful, the proposed study will significantly contribute to the field of HI prevention by examining the acceptability, feasibility and potential impact of an innovative strategy for delivering messages to high-risk youth, which encourage connection with the healthcare system and screening for HIV. This trial will fill a critical need to improve the sexual health outcomes of high-risk African American youth and lay the groundwork for a subsequent R01 proposal with a larger sample and that would include control sites.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescents exhibit high rates of STI/HIV, which have implications for a myriad of other sexual health issues, including reproductive health.

"Development of an HIV Prevention Game for African American Rural Adolescents     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) in the rural Deep South continue to experience a disproportionate increase in new HIV/AIDS infection despite the availability of HIV prevention interventions with demonstrated effectiveness. In comparison to other areas of the nation, the South has the highest number of adults and adolescents living with and dying from AIDS and the highest percentage of new AIDS cases among people living in rural areas. The number of new cases of HIV/AIDS and other STIs among adolescents is rapidly increasing in the rural Deep South and Alabama. It is important for prevention interventions to target young adolescents prior to their becoming sexually active. However, few interventions are directed toward young adolescents. The search for new intervention strategies appropriate for young adolescents has recently led to the use of electronic games. Electronic gaming interventions hold promise of being developmentally appropriate for young adolescents. However, research involving the use of such strategies in HIV prevention is quite limited. The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a proof of concept prototype for an individually tailored, electronic HIV prevention adventure game for young African American rural adolescents (AARAs), age 12-14 years. We will conduct focus groups with AARAs (n = 80) to better understand the sociocontextual influences on the sexual risk. The gaming intervention will be designed to help AARAs improve decision-making and learn behavioral strategies that assist them with avoiding sexual risk behaviors. Focus groups will be conducted to better understand the sociocontextual influences on HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Based on these findings, a draft of intervention components will be developed and programmed into a gaming prototype with the assistance of programming experts; the acceptability and relevance of the prototype will then be assessed with members of the target population (n=40). Verbatim transcripts of audiotapes of focus group discussions will be the primary data for analysis. Content analysis will be used in analysis and interpretation of the data. The qualitative research software, QSR N-Vivo(R), will be used in coding and sorting data. Descriptive statistical analyses of demographic data will be conducted using SPSS. The study is the first steps in a user-centric approach which involves identifying user needs and using a rapid iterative prototyping process. Findings from this research will serve as the basis for future application for NIH funding (e.g. R34 or R21) to furthe develop and test the electronic gaming intervention. The proposed career development plan is designed to provide additional training in qualitative data analyses, mixed methods research, HIV prevention intervention development, and electronic gaming development. In addition, this award will provide further hands-on research experience under the guidance of an interdisciplinary mentorship panel to meet training goals and enhance the applicant's development as a funded independent investigator and a recognized leader in the field of prevention of HIV and other STDs.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although many HIV prevention interventions have been developed for AA adolescents, few interventions focus on young AA adolescents. The continuing increasing rates of HIV and STIs in AAs in the Deep South warrants renewed efforts to reduce the disparity in HIV/AIDS by focusing on adolescents before they become engaged in risky sexual behavior. The proposed research will contribute to increasing the understanding of the sociocontextual factors that influence HIV/AIDs risk from the young African American Rural adolescents' perspective, and on using this information to develop a culturally relevant and developmentally appropriate innovative intervention.               Although many HIV prevention interventions have been developed for AA adolescents, few interventions focus on young AA adolescents.

"Biopsychosocial Determinants of Adolescent Obesity/Cardiovascular Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of adolescent obesity is high in the U.S., and in Latin America. While dramatic environmental changes in the food and physical environment are associated with increased risk, there continues to be inadequate understanding of the individual, family and community level factors that protect against the development of obesity. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms leading to disparate risk for obesity in low-income and Hispanic/Latino youth. The proposed 5-year project aims to elucidate interconnected biological and social pathways associated with adolescent obesity and risk for later development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This application involves approximately 620 Chilean adolescents, assessed in infancy, 3 to 5 years and 10 years as part of a NIH-supported cohort study of the behavioral and developmental effects of preventing iron deficiency anemia in infancy (n = 1645). As such, detailed longitudinal data related to growth, health and development have been collected. At 16 to 17 years, the youth will participate in study of activity, sleep and eating patterns using actigraphic recording and laboratory assessment of eating behavior. In addition, we will measure anthropometry, fat and muscle mass (DXA), fasting glucose, insulin (HOMA IR), lipids, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, orexin, CRP, and TNF alpha. Detailed information about family history, smoking, health, and psychosocial functioning will also be collected. Neighborhood level factors such as crime, walk ability and resources for physical activity and healthful food attributes will be assessed. Furthermore, a sizeable subset (n = 237) with sleep neurophysiology and actigraphic recordings at multiple time points will participate in 2-night polysmnographic sleep study at 16 years.    Guided by a life-course approach, we propose to investigate three Specific Aims:    Specific Aim 1 - To evaluate biological and psychosocial determinants of obesity and related metabolic disturbance in a cohort of adolescents followed since early infancy.    Specific Aim 2  - To assess associations between obesity/adiposity and biomarkers of adiposity-related metabolic disturbance in this sample of Chilean adolescents.    Specific Aim 3 - To assess the role of circadian patterns of physical activity, sleep and eating behavior on adiposity and related metabolic disturbance.    The long standing collaboration between the Institute for Nutrition and Technology at the University of Chile and the Center for Human Growth and Development at the University of Michigan provides an outstanding environment to study biological and psychosocial determinants of adolescent obesity in a low- to middle-income cohort of Latin American youth who are very similar in obesity risk to comparable U.S. youth. We expect to advance understanding of how developmental patterns of eating and activity are influenced by early life factors and in turn influence the development of obesity and related metabolic disturbance. Our study is unique in the depth and breadth of longitudinal psychosocial and biological data. We propose research that crosses disciplinary boundaries and has the potential to reveal important determinants of adolescent obesity for future intervention research. PUBLIC HEATLH RELEVANCE: Adolescent obesity develops during childhood in response to biological factors and social conditions. While biological factors such as genetic inheritance are difficult to change, social factors could be targets for preventive efforts. We expect to further understanding of the environmental and social conditions related to the development of obesity in a high risk urban, Hispanic/Latino population. We are interested in how children develop circadian rhythms related to eating, sleeping and activity, and subsequently how these patterns lead to obesity. Our goal is to unveil modifiable conditions in order to prevent obesity and related diseases including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

"Boys Transitions Through Puberty    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The social norms that guide boys' transitions through puberty and young adulthood are factors associated with high risk of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Yet few methodologies exist that adequately capture these norms and interpret their influences for response and intervention. A deeper understanding of the gendered norms societies are conveying to boys as they transition through puberty, and how best to shift those norms contributing to risky behavior, is critical for protecting both young men and their future sexual partners from acquiring HIV. Although a growing body of research exists on masculinity and HIV risk, the majority of studies were not conducted in SSA, the region with the highest HIV risk for adolescents; and few to no studies engaged boys themselves as a source of recommendations for future intervention. The objective of this small research grant (R03) is to develop a research methodology for engaging adolescent boys in the process of identifying the gendered influences shaping their transitions through puberty, the ways in which such influences shape boys' and girls' vulnerabilities to HIV, and how such influences can most effectively be addressed through intervention from the perspective of boys themselves. We propose the following specific aims: 1) To develop a novel in-depth participatory and dynamic methodology for ascertaining adolescent boys'  experiences of transitioning through puberty and the gendered norms that are most influential in  shaping young men's beliefs and behaviors related to masculinity, male sexuality, gender-based  violence, and HIV risk. 2) To field test the methodology with a sample of 50 boys aged 16-19 in Tanzania in and out of school 3) To ascertain from adolescent boys the most effective approaches for shifting local masculinity norms  that put them (and their future sexual partners) at risk of HIV and other sexually-transmitted infections  (STIs), and to utilize this exploratory data for the development of an R01 intervention and evaluation  grant application.  To accomplish these aims, we propose to conduct a two-year collaborative research study with adolescent and sexual-health researchers at Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) in Tanzania. The process of developing and testing the methodology in Tanzania will provide important preliminary findings in the Tanzania setting for the conceptualization of a boy's puberty book intervention, to be developed and evaluated through an R01 application (to be submitted at the completion of this R03 study), and will also serve as a model for other SSA countries interested in understanding and addressing the gendered norms impacting on adolescent risk of HIV and other STIs within their countries.        This study will contribute to the multi-disciplinary effort to reduce health disparities by exploring how gendered norms are shaping adolescent boys' transitions to young adulthood, and in turn their and their sexual partners' vulnerability to infection with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.

"Risk, Roles and Relationships: Project Prepared DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a two-group randomized trial of Project Prepared, an HIV/STI prevention program for youth aged 12-14. It folds together elements of three interventions we designed for middle adolescents into a comprehensive intervention that is developmentally appropriate for youth in early adolescence. Project Prepared has two parts. First is a 14-session training program held over 7 weeks that covers five major predictors of high risk behavior: developmental na¿vet¿, cognitive factors, gender roles, relationship factors and family formation. It is followed by a 5-week internship that incorporates resilience and youth development through making youth peer educators to other adolescents about HIV/STI risk. Project Prepared is theoretically based, comprehensive, intensive, and appropriate to the developmental stage, race/ethnicity, and social context of inner-city youth of color. It emphasizes skills in avoiding risky sexual situations, and provides medically accurate information about sexual development, sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy. We will conduct a two group randomized trial (n=400) to test the effectiveness of Project Prepared on cognitive factors (HIV/STI knowledge, sexual self-efficacy; intention to use a condom); relationship factors (immature romantic beliefs, relationship self-efficacy), gender norms (macho man, powerless female), and resilience. The control condition will be TEEN, an award winning program with proven effectiveness in reducing psychological symptoms with no HV/STD content.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black and Latino youth are at particular risk for HIV/STIs, but currently available interventions for young adolescents have shown only modest, short term effects. We have developed an intensive, comprehensive HIV/STI prevention program, for youth aged 12-14, Project Prepared. The project is expected to generate important information on sexual risk behavior in early adolescents, and may lead to a new program that is effective in reducing HIV/STI risk for youth in the future.

"The Effects of Prenatal Cocaine Exposure in Adolescence  6. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is a continuation of grant RO1 DA07957 ""The Effects of Prenatal Cocaine Exposure at School Age,"" a longitudinal study of the prenatal effects of cocaine/polydrug exposure (n=382; 194 cocaine-exposed and 188 non-cocaine-exposed). This study, as well as others, has found differences among prenatally cocaine- exposed children that include deficits in perceptual reasoning, attention, language development and externalizing behavior problems compared to non-exposed children. The effects of environmental lead exposure and the differential impact of caregiver placement have been identified as important determinants of early developmental outcomes in this cohort, indicating the need for continued study at this developmental stage of newly emerging risk behaviors and social stress. We propose following this large cohort from age 15 through 18 years with the overarching objective of determining whether the negative effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on brain development continue to interfere with optimal developmental outcomes, and if cocaine exposure is associated with increased incidence of risky behavior, particularly substance misuse and mental health problems. Adolescents will be assessed using self and caregiver report, interview, bioassay and standardized assessments. Specific aims are to: assess the relationship of prenatal cocaine exposure to cognitive and behavioral outcomes (risk taking and mental health problems) in adolescence and to assess lead levels, iron deficiency, caregiving and environmental correlates of exposure; explore models that assess the relationship of early cognitive deficits and behavior problems to risk taking behaviors in an adolescent high-risk cocaine/polydrug exposed cohort; assess parenting experiences and behaviors of caregivers of cocaine- exposed and non-exposed adolescents; and assess the direct and indirect relationships of prenatal cocaine exposure to adolescent behavioral outcomes. Our model focuses on the mediating effects of earlier deficits in cognitive performance, attention and inhibitory control on risk taking behavior and the moderating effects of gender. Effects of lead exposure, iron deficiency and caregiving environment will be explored using structural equation modeling (SEM) and path modeling. The results of this study will provide the basis for designing culturally sensitive interventions prenatally or early in life that could reduce risky teen behaviors and ultimately reduce serious lifelong health problems including substance dependence, trauma and HIV infection.  7. PROJECT NARRATIVE A pattern of attention, behavioral regulation and cognitive problems among prenatally cocaine-exposed infants and children has been identified by this research group as well as others. Results indicate that fetal exposure to cocaine may have specific effects on brain development that can be observed in early cognitive and behavioral outcomes and that outcomes are also influenced by level of environmental lead exposure and caregiving quality. This study hypothesizes that the pattern of deficits found in childhood may translate into greater risk taking behavior including substance misuse and mental health problems in adolescence that can have grave consequences on adult productivity and health. Further research on prenatally cocaine-exposed adolescents will identify key points for the timing and focus of intervention and provide important content for public health messages.",The Effects of

"Pathways to overweight and pubertal timing in African-American and White girls    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Health disparities between African-American and white girls are evident early in life and continue over the life course. In adulthood, African-American females bear a disproportionate burden of poor health, give birth to sicker babies, and die at younger ages than white females. The persistence and depth of these disparities is recognized as a major public health problem and the elimination of these health disparities has been identified as one of the two major goals of the decade within Healthy People 2010. Despite the high national priority given to eliminating health disparities, progress towards this goal has been slow. Research has focused primarily on understanding the extent and depth of the problem and in establishing links between broad measures of social and economic factors and health disparities. Much of the research has used cross- sectional data--a design that cannot adequately examine associations between a health outcome and risk exposures that temporally preceded the observation window. Despite rapid developments in the biological sciences suggesting strong influences of early life exposures on the shaping of biological processes, few studies have investigated health disparities in light of early childhood contextual experiences. In this study, we investigate the impact of early childhood contexts on adolescent physical health using the Life Course Health Development Theory which posits that health variability is tied to the interaction of multiple contextual factors at sensitive life periods and that extraorganismic influences ""get under one's skin"" through biological processes designed to adapt to acute stress. In this theory the early contextual period starts with the mother's prepregnancy health and continues through the intrauterine and early childhood years. This is the time period that is the focus of our study. We will examine early childhood contextual factors from 4 domains using a multigenerational data base (NLSY79 Mother, Child, and Young Adult files) that has great strength in the depth and richness of contextual variables. We will examine how these contextual factors differentially impact the physical health (somatic growth, age of menarche, and self-reported general health status) of African-American and white girls in adolescence. The overall aim of this project is to determine how early life contexts differentially influence the physical health of African-American and white adolescent girls. The specific aims are: 1)To quantify and describe race differences in early childhood environmental contexts; 2)To test whether there are racial disparities in adolescent physical health in African-American and white girls matched on early childhood contextual factors. 3) To model race differences in adolescent physical health as a function of the early childhood environment and to investigate the extent to which race differences in adolescent physical health are attributable to: a) Differences in the level of available resources within contexts key to young children, b) Differences in children's health response to early environmental contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major thrust of this proposal is to understand how early childhood environments differentially influence the health of white and African-American adolescent females. The knowledge gained from this research will aid with the development of prevention and/or early intervention strategies aimed at improving the health of African-American females. The results of this study will inform practice at the individual and aggregate level, and should assist with achieving Healthy People 2010 goals to reduce the level of health disparities in minorities in this country.

"Alcohol, Marijuana, and Risky Sex: Group Interventions with Detained Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescents are at great risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including HIV/AIDS, and are one of few HIV risk groups for whom HIV/AIDS incidence is not declining (CDC, 2005a). Compared to the general adolescent population, adolescents involved with the criminal justice system are younger at first intercourse, have a greater number of sex partners, and lower rates of condom use, resulting in higher rates of unintended pregnancy and STDs (e.g., Teplin, Mericle, McClelland & Abram, 2003). Data from our previous research efforts suggests that it is heavy alcohol use in concert with sexual activity, rather than heavy alcohol use generally, that is most strongly related to lack of condom use (Bryan, Ray, & Cooper, in press). Further, we have demonstrated initially higher rates of condom use at follow-up among adolescents who participated in a combined sexual risk reduction + alcohol risk reduction intervention as compared to a sexual risk reduction only intervention and an information only control intervention in our prior NIAAA-supported randomized controlled intervention with incarcerated adolescents, (R01 AA013844-01; Schmiege, Broaddus, Bryan, et al., 2008). The goal of the proposed study is to build on those successful findings, and on our ongoing work (RO1 DA019139-01) and that of others (Lebeau-Craven et al., 2003; Kingree & Betz, 2003) which suggests that marijuana use is more prevalent than alcohol use generally and during sex than is alcohol use among criminally-involved adolescents. In addition, NIDA has noted that marijuana is a specific drug of abuse that may be an emerging risk factor for HIV and STDs, but one for which there is little basic or intervention research. In this continuation, we propose to conduct a second randomized controlled trial to compare an expanded sexual risk reduction intervention that includes both an alcohol component and a marijuana component, to a sexual risk reduction intervention that includes only an alcohol component, and a sexual risk reduction only condition. Each of these interventions includes a standard theory-based didactic presentation of sexual reduction intervention material and a group motivational enhancement therapy component focused on alcohol and marijuana, alcohol use only, or sexual risk behavior only. We hope to show that: 1) combining both substances into one intervention further increases its efficacy at decreasing sexual risk behavior because of its broad coverage of the three most highly prevalent risk behaviors (alcohol, marijuana, and unprotected sex) in this population, 2) it is the substance use content, and not the group MET modality that is responsible for this increased efficacy, and 3) the intervention exerts its effects through theoretically-based mediators. The relative success of these interventions will have implications for HIV/STD risk reduction programming for high risk adolescents in the criminal justice system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescents involved with the criminal justice system are younger at first intercourse, have a greater number of sex partners, and lower rates of condom use than their non criminally-involved counterparts. This high level of sexual risk results in higher rates of unintended pregnancy and STDs including HIV/AIDS. These young people also have extraordinarily high rates of alcohol and marijuana use, and many have demonstrated that substance use plays a causal role in sexual risk. This research is designed to implement and carefully evaluate new intervention technologies that have the goal of decrease alcohol- and marijuana-related sexual risk behavior in this population of highly vulnerable young people.

"College Students as Facilitators to Reduce Adolescent Obesity Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Appalachian region has a population of 23 million residing in 420 counties and 13 states. Forty-two percent of the region's population is rural. Compared to other regions, people living in Appalachia were reported to face a heavier burden from chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. The proportions of obese high school students in Southern Appalachia are among the highest in the nation. Health risk habits including unhealthy eating and physical inactivity are often established during adolescence and may contribute significantly to this chronic disease disparity. Although adolescent obesity is an urgent public health issue, effective interventions are few. Therefore, we propose to test an academia-community partnership approach using college students as facilitators to prevent obesity among adolescents. The long-term goal is to establish an effective academia-community partnership program to address adolescent obesity disparity in Southern Appalachia. The specific aims are: 1) To develop a peer- based health education program focusing on establishing positive peer norms and supportive peer relationships toward healthy eating and physical activity among high school students, 2) To test the efficacy of the program, and 3) To explore the mechanisms underlying the program. Twelve (six per each semester) undergraduates at East Tennessee State University will be trained to conduct an eleven-week peer-based health education program as peer facilitators. A cluster-randomized trial design will be used and 6 rural high schools will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. Approximately 1440 adolescents will be included as study subjects. Body mass index (BMI) percentile, dietary behavior, and physical activity among the study subjects will be assessed pre-intervention, at the end of the intervention, and 12 months post-intervention. Mean levels and/or prevalence of differences in the assessments (BMI percentile, obesity status, eating behavior, and physical activity) will be compared between the intervention and control group at the 3 time points (pre-intervention, end of intervention, and 12 months post-intervention). Peer group norms, body image, supportive peer relationships, role modeling, behavioral control/self-efficacy, attitudes, and intentions toward healthy eating and physical activity will be assessed pre-intervention, at the end of the intervention, and 12 months post-intervention. The roles of these factors as mediators of the intervention in modifying adolescents' eating and physical activity behaviors, as well as, body mass index will be examined. This proposed study will provide an important evaluation of an academia-community partnership using college students as facilitators to address adolescent obesity disparity in Southern Appalachia. If proven effective, the proposed program can meet the critical community needs for adolescent obesity prevention by engaging higher education institutes and students in service and fostering within them an ethic of civic responsibility. The program will be easily transferable from research to action without substantial additional resources and will be a sustainable win-win program for both the community and the academy. 1      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed study will provide an important evaluation of a peer-based program.

"Technology to connect at-risk youth to testing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among the numerous health disparities disproportionately burdening people of color, HIV/AIDS is among the highest. In the African American community the HIV/AIDS epidemic is one of the most urgent public health issues. In order to address the health disparity in HIV/AIDS, detection of HIV in the African American community is crucial. The benefits for early detection of HIV include potentially prolonged duration and quality of life for those living with the virus. HIV testing has also been proposed as a HIV preventive strategy. Detection of HIV has a number of potential preventive benefits, including reduced transmission risk behaviors by those infected9 and reduced viral load by those taking antiretroviral medications, whereby potentially reducing transmission. The proposed study makes a significant public health impact by developing and pilot testing an innovative strategy to increase the number of high-risk adolescents receiving HIV screening. In response to PA-09-146 (Pilot and Feasibility Studies in Preparation for Drug Abuse Prevention Trials [r34]), we propose a pilot study to examine the acceptability and feasibility of a peer-driven, HIV-testing campaign. Peer education and outreach strategies have been successful at reducing sexual risk behavior and increasing the use of health resources in adolescents and other at-risk groups, including adults residing in census tracts where STI rates are high. A potential vehicle for outreach to adolescents is socially interactive technologies (e.g., text messages). The proposed study makes a scientific impact in examining the effectiveness of messaging diffused through the social network of adolescents. A total of 100 current patients at an urban adolescent health clinic serving predominately African Americans will be recruited to disseminate at least 5 text messages to friends they believe are sexually active. Youth will be provided with a brief guide to help them develop their messages. The youth generated text messages will encourage their friends to visit the clinic and get tested. The specific aims of this project are to: Aim 1: Develop protocols and a theory-informed message guide for a peer-driven text message intervention for adolescents recruited from an adolescent health clinic. Aim 2: Examine the acceptability and feasibility of sending text messages related to obtaining HIV/STI testing. We will obtain participant feedback and examine the recruitment rate, number of youth failing to meet inclusion criteria, number of youth verified to have sent text messages, and number of text messages sent. We will also obtain feedback from the clinic providers regarding impact on patient and services flow, provider reactions, and impact on clinical visit. Aim 3: Preliminarily examine the efficacy of a youth generated messaging intervention to increase the: 1) number of high-risk youth seeking services and 2) clinic volume as measured by: a) number of new patients at clinic, b) increase in rate of new patient appointments, and c) number of STI tests conducted. If successful, the proposed study will significantly contribute to the field of HI prevention by examining the acceptability, feasibility and potential impact of an innovative strategy for delivering messages to high-risk youth, which encourage connection with the healthcare system and screening for HIV. This trial will fill a critical need to improve the sexual health outcomes of high-risk African American youth and lay the groundwork for a subsequent R01 proposal with a larger sample and that would include control sites.          Adolescents exhibit high rates of STI/HIV, which have implications for a myriad of other sexual health issues, including reproductive health. Further, African American youth are disproportionately impacted by HIV. The proposed study will significantly contribute to the field of HIV/STI prevention by examining the impact of an innovative strategy for delivering telehealth messages to high-risk youth that encourage connection with the healthcare system and screening for HIV. This trial will fill a critical need t improve the sexual health outcomes of high-risk youth.

"The Role of Place on the Co-occurrence of ATOD Use and Violence Among Youth     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Mentored Scientist Career Development Award (K01) that provides me the training and research experience necessary to develop an innovative research program focused on ATOD use and violent/aggressive behavior among youth. My research and professional career have focused on vulnerable populations of young people living in communities characterized by substantial health and social disparities. My primary research interest focuses on resiliency in the prevention of ATOD use and violent behavior among at-risk urban adolescents and young adults. This research interest stems from my experience as a Nurse Practitioner in school-based and community-based clinics with adolescents and young adults. To date, my program of research has focused on the healthy development of adolescents and prevention of risk behaviors, particularly youth violence. My long-term goal is to become an independent investigator in the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violent/aggressive behavior among youth, and the role of primitive factors in the healthy development of youth, specifically primitive factors within the neighborhood context (place). With my long- term goal in mind, my training and research objectives for the five-year award period are: 1) To develop expertise in ATOD use, the relationship between ATOD use and violent behavior, and their concomitant individual and neighborhood risk and primitive factors; 2) To expand my quantitative skills to examine for the effect of place (neighborhood) on adolescent ATOD use and the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence/aggression overtime; 3) To develop skills in intervention development, evaluation, and design; and 4) To advance my knowledge of the ethical conduct of intervention research with adolescents, including considerations regarding recruitment, data collection, management and security, and intervention. Training will include: graduate coursework in spatial-temporal analysis; short courses in intervention development and design and advanced multilevel modeling; mentored literature reviews on youth ATOD use, ATOD use and violence, and neighborhood effects of substance use among youth; participation in substance use interdisciplinary workgroups and meetings; mentorship in developing school and community partnerships for intervention research and translating research findings into interventions; and three mentored research projects. I will be mentored by experts in adolescent development, adolescent substance use, spatial analysis, and intervention development and implementation. Guided by a developmental-ecological perspective, I have proposed two secondary data analysis projects and one data collection project to address the following overarching research aims: 1) To examine the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence/aggression among urban youth; 2) To explore how place influences the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence; 3) To examine the relationship between future orientation, place, and the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence during adolescence; and 4) To develop an intervention and relevant measures that will be the basis for an R21 and future RCT R01. Using data from the NIDA-funded longitudinal Flint Adolescent Study (n = 850, PI: Zimmerman), the first project will focus on the trajectories of ATOD use and violent behavior over time, and will identify neighborhood characteristics that influence trajectories of ATOD use and violent behavior in a sample of urban youth. I will use dual trajectory growth curve analysis and cross-legged path analyses to explore the relationship between ATOD use and violence from age 14-32. Multilevel modeling analyses will be used to identify neighborhood characteristics that influence the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence. Using data from a county-wide school based survey (Coordinated Community Student Survey; C2S2); the second research project will focus on the relationship between future orientation, place, and the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violent behavior. I will use multi-group, multilevel SEM (ML-SEM) to examine differences in the relationship between future orientation and ATOD use/violent behavior based on neighborhood factors. The third study involves conducting a survey with a subsample of C2S2 youth (n = 500 6th grade students) for a more in-depth exploration of the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violent behavior, future orientation and its relationship to ATOD and violent behavior, and how place influence future orientation and ATOD use and violent behavior in a sample of urban youth. Measures, study design, and analyses will be determined based on knowledge, skills, and mentoring received as part of the training plan. In research projects 2 and 3, I will use spatial analytic techniques to examine the effects of place-based risk and primitive factors on future orientation, youth ATOD use and violence. In the proposed projects, I seek to identify place-based assets and resources that are associated with preventing the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence and promote the development of future orientation. In collaboration with school/community partners, I will use these findings to develop an intervention focused on promoting health youth development and reducing ATOD use and violent behavior during year 4, and I will submit an R21 to test this intervention during year 5.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug use and violent behavior can place youth at risk for not completing the developmental tasks of adolescence and limits their transition into healthy productive adults. NIDA and others have recognized the importance of primary prevention strategies to prevent adolescent drug use. The proposed research investigates the relationship between neighborhood and individual-level risk and protective factors and the co- occurrence of ATOD use and violent behavior. The research findings will inform the development of an intervention to prevent ATOD use and violent behavior. The research project will be embedded in a comprehensive training program design to help me strength and develop new research skills under the direction of a strong mentorship team.            ",The Role of Place on the Co-occurrence of ATOD Use and Violence Among Youth,8423850,K01DA034765,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Adolescent Behavior ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Homicide ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nurse Practitioners ', ' Play ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' spatial perception ', ' spatial orientation (perception) ', ' spatial orientation ', ' perceptual spatial orientation ', ' Spatial Discrimination ', ' Space Perception ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Review Literature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Security ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' 6th grade ', ' sixth grade ', ' youth drug use ', ' adolescent drug use ', ' youth substance use ', ' adolescent substance use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' teen violence ', ' youth violence ', ' social disparities ', ' Mind ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' stem ', ' spatial relationship ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' ATOD ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2013,139070,0.06503521896284324
"Family Aggression and Trajectories of Adolescent Adaptation: Bioregulatory Effect     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aggressive marital conflict and harsh parenting (family aggression) are highly prevalent. Chronic exposure to family aggression elevates adolescents' risk for antisocial and risky behavior, depressed mood, and cognitive decrements - significant public health problems that increase in prevalence and severity during adolescence. Explaining variability in trajectories of adaptation in the context of family aggression - why some adolescent's exhibit resilience and others deteriorate - is a critical need for science and practice. Findings stemming from the proposed study will illuminate autonomic nervous system activity and sleep regulation variables (bioregulatory processes), as well as economic and social context (peer affiliation) variables, which may mediate the risk of family aggression or operate to exacerbate or protect against its effects on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral maladjustment from late childhood through late adolescence. The design builds on a well-characterized 3-wave study; children ranged between 8-11 years across waves. The proposed study will involve 3 additional waves with a 1-year lag: 50% girls, ~14-15 years at T4, with high representation of both African-American and lower SES families. Study constructs are assessed with multiple informants and measures. Sleep parameters are examined objectively, via actigraphy, and subjectively. ANS activity (sympathetic and parasympathetic) is measured with standard indices, and reactivity is assessed with well-established lab procedures. The large and diverse sample, breadth of measurement across important adolescent outcome domains, and a 6-wave longitudinal design will permit analyses of long- term developmental trajectories, interactions among biopsychosocial processes, and profiles of family, bioregulatory and socioecological risk. The proposed study will create new knowledge in areas of great significance through investigations of bioregularoty and socioecological variables that have the potential to enhance understanding of risk among adolescents exposed to family aggression and to identify physiological, behavioral, and ecological targets for intervention. Outcome variables include public health priorities, such as behavioral and emotional adjustment, academic performance (PA-07-046, Research on Mind-Body Interactions and Health), violence (PA-09-169, Research on Teen Dating Violence), and sleep disturbances (PA-07-140, Research on Sleep and Sleep Disorders). Hypotheses will be tested across a wide range of socioecological contexts with a diverse community sample (PA-07-379, Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities). Other key strengths include our focus on estimating trajectories of adolescent functioning across multiple domains; considering the direction of effects between constructs; and comparing the strength of associations at different time points across development.          Aggressive marital conflict and harsh parenting are highly prevalent and elevate adolescents' risk for antisocial and risky behavior, depressed mood, and cognitive decrements- significant public health problems that increase in prevalence and severity during adolescence. However, the potential effects of bioregulatory and socioecological variables on trajectories of adolescent adjustment in the context of family aggression are not well understood. The proposed study will illuminate autonomic nervous system activity, sleep regulation, and socioecological variables that may mediate the risk of family aggression or operate to exacerbate or protect against its effects on adolescent functioning across multiple domains from late childhood through late adolescence, which will help identify behavioral, physiological, and ecological targets for prevention and intervention.

"Mexican-origin Teen Moms, Their Infants, and Mother Figures: Health & Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will examine how developmental, family, cultural, and economic factors interact to inform the health and development of two groups of children who are disproportionately at risk for negative health outcomes:  Mexican-origin adolescent mothers and their young children. Adolescent females of Mexican origin have the highest national birthrate, and it is over twice the overall national rate (National Vital Statistics Report, 2005).  Because children of adolescent mothers are at increased risk for negative outcomes (Chandra, Schivello, Ravi, Weinstein, & Hook, 2002) and adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning has been identified as a predictor of children's health and development (Carothers, Borkowski, Lefever, & Whitman, 2005), it is critical to examine the factors that inform adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning, their parenting behaviors, and in turn, their children's health and development. We propose to build on our study of Mexican-origin adolescent mothers, their mothers or mother figures (referred to in our study as the female family member; FFM), and their infants, which involved data gathered from adolescents and FFMs during the adolescents' third trimester of pregnancy (Wave 1), and from adolescent mothers, FFMs, and infants when infants were 10 months of age (Wave 2) and again when infants were 24 months of age (Wave 3). We propose to collect three additional points of measurement from all three family members in the 206 families who participated in the original project (N = 618).  This longitudinal, multi-generational study will capture cultural, family, and developmental processes and outcomes for a) adolescent mothers and FFMs over a five-year period beginning when adolescent mothers are in middle/late adolescence (i.e., 15-18 years of age) through emerging adulthood (20-23 years of age), and b) their young children from infancy (i.e., 10 months) through early childhood (i.e., 5 yrs of age). Specific aims are  to examine (1) the linkages between trajectories of two normative developmental processes (i.e., ethnic identity,  autonomy) and trajectories of Mexican-origin adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning (e.g., depressive  symptoms) from middle/late adolescence through emerging adulthood, and to identify family, peer, and cultural  characteristics that moderate these associations; (2) how family (i.e., mother-adolescent conflict), economic  (i.e., economic hardship), and cultural (i.e., acculturative stress and discrimination) stressors are linked to  adolescent mothers' trajectories of psychosocial functioning, and to investigate the family, peer, and cultural  characteristics that moderate these associations; and (3) how trajectories of adolescent mothers' psychosocial  functioning predict their parenting behaviors and, in turn, trajectories of their children's health and development;  we also will test family, peer, and cultural characteristics that moderate these associations. A focus on Mexican-  origin children is critical because Latinos (of which Mexican-origin are a majority) are repeatedly identified as an  at-risk population for negative health and behavioral outcomes and, in fact, show substantial risk for  maladjustment in almost all leading health indicators identified by Healthy People 2010 (CDC, 2008).       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latinos show greater risk for maladjustment in almost all of the leading health indicators identified by Healthy  People 2010 (CDC, 2008) and bear a disproportionate burden of disease, injury, death, and disability in the  U.S. (CDC, 2004a). Furthermore, Mexican-origin adolescent females lead the nation in rates of teen pregnancy (with rates over twice the national average; National Vital Statistics Report, 2005). This research will contribute significantly to understanding how to promote positive health and development among Mexican-origin adolescent mothers and their young children, which is in line with the Surgeon General's call to address health disparities among Latinos and other ethnic minorities (U.S. Surgeon General, 2008).

"Investigating Adverse Effects of Adolescent Group Interventions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project seeks to examine adverse effects of group interventions on adolescents' externalizing behavior. Group interventions represent one of the most economical, convenient, and common solution to adolescent behavior problems, a major dilemma for our society that accounts for the greatest number of referrals to mental health clinics. Findings from program evaluation studies have begun to suggest that these groups unexpectedly increase the externalizing behaviors that they were designed to reduce or prevent. However, research has yet to verify whether these unexpected findings represent a meaningful, significant, and lasting adverse effect on adolescent participants rather than a methodologically-driven empirical artifact. Further research based on a strong research design and longitudinal data is necessary to make this important distinction. This project integrates clinical, developmental, and quantitative approaches to investigate a previously discovered adverse effect of an adolescent group intervention. The current study will draw data from a longitudinal, multi-site randomized controlled trial of the Bridges to High School / Puentes a La Secund¿ria Program, a culturally competent, multicomponent prevention program designed to reduce risk during the middle school transition, which has demonstrated positive effects across an array of outcomes. Data were collected at the beginning of 7th grade, with follow-up data collected at the end of the 7th,8th, 9th, and 12th grade from a sample of primarily low-income Mexican American adolescents and their mothers. These data will allow the opportunity to examine intervention effects on long-term outcomes, trajectories of externalizing behaviors across adolescence, and potential mediators of observed effects, each of which provide critical and unique information on the development and prevention of externalizing problems among adolescents.         This study will examine whether adverse effects of adolescent group interventions, which have been found in 24-29% of evaluation studies, are lasting and clinically significant and seeks to identify the processes that explain them. In addition, this stuy reflects the current priority among researchers to refine innovative prevention strategies that are  personalized for optimal use among underserved populations, such as Mexican Americans (MAs), the fastest growing US minority group who face substantial health disparities. Investigating the risk and cultural factors that might influence intervention responses among MA youth is necessary to reduce these disparities and their long-term personal and public health burden and strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported research.",Investigating Adverse Effects of Adolescent Group Interventions,8537791,F31MH097323,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Adolescent Behavior ', ' Age ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disruptive behavioral disorder ', ' Disruptive Behavior Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Peer Group ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Societies ', ' Solutions ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Competence ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' teenage mom ', ' teen mother ', ' teen mom ', ' adolescent mother ', ' teenage mother ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' middle school ', ' experience ', ' mental disorder diagnosis ', ' high school ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' 7th grade ', ' seventh grade ', ' 8th grade ', ' eighth grade ', ' high school freshman ', ' 9th grade ', ' ninth grade ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' deviancy ', ' deviant ', ' high school senior ', ' 12th grade ', ' twelfth grade ', ' Prevention ', ' universal preventive measure ', ' universal preventive interventions ', ' universal interventions ', ' universal prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' response ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' group intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NIMH,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2013,32849,0.12286329904347228
"Pathological Adaptation to Exposure to Community Violence in Minority Male Youth     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the current project is to examine the model of pathologic adaptation to community violence in a sample of African American and Latino male adolescents residing in low socioeconomic urban neighborhoods. The pathologic adaptation model suggests that youth who become desensitized to violence show less emotional distress, but more violent behavior. The intent of the current project is to test the feasibility of the model, as well as understand how protective factors (i.e., support from family, coping strategies) and vulnerability factors (i.e., deviant beliefs, aggression status) may increas or decrease risk for pathologic adaptation. This application proposes to achieve this goal by conducting secondary data analysis with this vulnerable population. The proposed study will be accomplished through three aims. Aim 1 is to examine the model of pathologic adaptation to community violence using multiple indicators of violence (i.e., severity, witnessing, and victimization). Aim 1 will be tested by [latent growth curve modeling]. Aim 2 is to examine coping processes, parental support, and deviant beliefs as moderators of the linear and nonlinear associations of community violence to pathologic adaptation outcomes. [Latent growth curve modeling] will be used to test Aim 2. Aim 3 is to examine moderating effects of participant ethnicity and pre-test aggression status on the associations of community violence to pathologic adaptation outcomes. [Latent growth curve modeling] will also be used to test Aim 3. The proposed research has the potential to narrow the critical research gap in knowledge on the variations in the impact of exposure to community violence among young men of color residing in low-income, urban communities. The knowledge gained from the study can be used to inform the development of effective preventive interventions to preempt or halt the progression of maladaptive outcomes in these youth. Specifically, the longitudinal, prospective examination of the pathologic adaptation model in this sample will help to identify specific periods of vulnerability, critical levels of ecological risk, vulnerability and protective factors, and, consequently, determine when, where and how to intervene. The identification of aspects of exposure to community violence associated with maladaptive outcomes will reveal aspects of youth environments that can be modified as part of community-level efforts to improve adolescent well-being. The identification of vulnerability factors (i.e., pre-test aggression-statu) will help to identify youth who are at heightened risk for desensitization in response to community violence exposure and, thus, should be targeted for intervention. In addition, understanding how individual (i.e., deviant cognitions, coping strategies) and family (i.e., parental support) factors may increase or reduce the risk of maladaptive outcomes in response to exposure to community violence will yield information about malleable processes that can be targeted to maximize intervention efficacy/effectiveness.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been some successful efforts to curtail violence and crime in urban communities, ethnic minority male adolescents who reside in these communities remain vulnerable to very high levels of exposure to community violence and violence-related outcomes. The goal of the proposal is to elucidate the role of community violence exposure in the development of emotional and behavioral problems over time in a particularly vulnerable group, namely low-income, ethnic minority male adolescents. Such information is essential to inform the development of effective preventive interventions to reduce health disparities and the economic and social burden of community violence exposure (e.g., incarceration, homicide) in ethnic minority males.            ",Pathological Adaptation to Exposure to Community Violence in Minority Male Youth,8512873,R03HD072112,"['adolescent boy ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' Age ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Cognition ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Homicide ', ' Interview ', ' male ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' teacher ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' Equation ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' preempt ', ' Participant ', ' gang ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' deviancy ', ' deviant ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' emotional distress ', ' social ', ' antisocial ', ' anti social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' burden to community ', ' community burden ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' desensitization ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' parent grant ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' early adolescence ', ' young man ', ' ']",NICHD,LOYOLA UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R03,2013,68071,0.05967530536488351
"CBPR to Reduce Adolescent Pregnancy and HIV in a DC Public Housing Community     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The District of Columbia is home to both many of the most affluent and most vulnerable communities in the nation. Public housing communities in the city represent the extremes of concentrated disadvantage: racial segregation, poverty, violent crime, high rates of incarceration and dismal health statistics. For more than a decade, the Urban Institute (Ul) has worked closely with the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA), residents of DCHA public housing communities, and similar high-poverty urban communities across the nation to develop and improve outcomes and reduce disparities via improvements to health and social services and structures. As a result of concerns voiced by DCHA residents across multiple housing communities, DCHA approached Ul two years ago to assist them in addressing what they described as ""the problems with our girls."" Based on DCHA and resident recommendations, Ul reached out to resident leaders from Benning Terrace, a high-poverty, African American public housing community which has the highest crime rate and is the most underserved, located in the Districts' Ward 7. A preliminary needs assessment jointly conducted by Ul, DCHA and public housing residents identified a group of related adolescent sexual health concerns - sexual violence and coercion, teen pregnancy and HIV/STI. The current application includes the strengthening of this ongoing collaboration of the DCHA, African American residents (adults and adolescents) of Benning Terrace, community-based health, social service and faith-based organizations, Ul and university-based health disparities researchers to reduce adolescent sexual health disparities. Sexual assault and coercion, pregnancy, and HIV/STI are all significantly over-represented among African Americans in DC; HIV rates are the highest in the nation, with up to 12% of women infected. The proposed three-year CBPR process includes 1) a community-driven needs assessment; 2) an asset mapping process regarding resources and expertise available for inclusion in a sustainable intervention; 3) development of program and evaluation models; and 4) piloting to assess program feasibility, acceptability, perceived efficacy and outcomes.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): Adverse sexual health outcomes (i.e., sexual coercion, pregnancy, and HIV/STIs) are significantly over-represented by African American adolescents, and reach their highest levels in high-poverty neighborhoods. In public housing communities, the use of CBPR to develop interventions targeting adolescents and their parents is a unique approach toward reducing adolescent sexual health disparities.              ",CBPR to Reduce Adolescent Pregnancy and HIV in a DC Public Housing Community,8500823,R24MD008064,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Cities ', ' Coercion ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"The Effects of Prenatal Cocaine Exposure in Adolescence  6. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is a continuation of grant RO1 DA07957 ""The Effects of Prenatal Cocaine Exposure at School Age,"" a longitudinal study of the prenatal effects of cocaine/polydrug exposure (n=382; 194 cocaine-exposed and 188 non-cocaine-exposed). This study, as well as others, has found differences among prenatally cocaine- exposed children that include deficits in perceptual reasoning, attention, language development and externalizing behavior problems compared to non-exposed children. The effects of environmental lead exposure and the differential impact of caregiver placement have been identified as important determinants of early developmental outcomes in this cohort, indicating the need for continued study at this developmental stage of newly emerging risk behaviors and social stress. We propose following this large cohort from age 15 through 18 years with the overarching objective of determining whether the negative effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on brain development continue to interfere with optimal developmental outcomes, and if cocaine exposure is associated with increased incidence of risky behavior, particularly substance misuse and mental health problems. Adolescents will be assessed using self and caregiver report, interview, bioassay and standardized assessments. Specific aims are to: assess the relationship of prenatal cocaine exposure to cognitive and behavioral outcomes (risk taking and mental health problems) in adolescence and to assess lead levels, iron deficiency, caregiving and environmental correlates of exposure; explore models that assess the relationship of early cognitive deficits and behavior problems to risk taking behaviors in an adolescent high-risk cocaine/polydrug exposed cohort; assess parenting experiences and behaviors of caregivers of cocaine- exposed and non-exposed adolescents; and assess the direct and indirect relationships of prenatal cocaine exposure to adolescent behavioral outcomes. Our model focuses on the mediating effects of earlier deficits in cognitive performance, attention and inhibitory control on risk taking behavior and the moderating effects of gender. Effects of lead exposure, iron deficiency and caregiving environment will be explored using structural equation modeling (SEM) and path modeling. The results of this study will provide the basis for designing culturally sensitive interventions prenatally or early in life that could reduce risky teen behaviors and ultimately reduce serious lifelong health problems including substance dependence, trauma and HIV infection.  7. PROJECT NARRATIVE A pattern of attention, behavioral regulation and cognitive problems among prenatally cocaine-exposed infants and children has been identified by this research group as well as others. Results indicate that fetal exposure to cocaine may have specific effects on brain development that can be observed in early cognitive and behavioral outcomes and that outcomes are also influenced by level of environmental lead exposure and caregiving quality. This study hypothesizes that the pattern of deficits found in childhood may translate into greater risk taking behavior including substance misuse and mental health problems in adolescence that can have grave consequences on adult productivity and health. Further research on prenatally cocaine-exposed adolescents will identify key points for the timing and focus of intervention and provide important content for public health messages.",The Effects of

"Culturally-Specific HIV Prevention with Latino Adolescent Alcohol Abusers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 research and training award advances the long-term goal of reducing ethnic/racial health disparities in HIV/AIDS infection. The proposed training and research plans will enable the PI to develop the skills needed for an independent research career in this area of research. The objective of this application is to develop skills in HIV prevention research and the use of Community-Based Participatory Research and qualitative data collection methods to inform the development of an intervention which targets specific risk and protective factors associated with Hispanic adolescents' drinking and sexual risk taking behaviors. Data demonstrate that both sexual risk behaviors and alcohol use are prominent among Hispanic adolescents, and that the co- occurrence of these behaviors are directly associated with HIV/AIDS infection. Despite literature demonstrating the influence that intrapersonal factors, contextual factors, and culturally specific factors play in Hispanic adolescents' drinking and sexual risk taking behaviors, to date, no interventions addressing all three of these factors exists. This application addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a culturally specific HIV prevention intervention addressing risk and protective factors within these three domains to reduce Hispanic adolescents' risk of HIV infection. Specifically, the culturally specific intervention will include: 1) an adolescent Individual Motivational Interview (IMI) to address alcohol- and sex-related expectancies and attitudes, and alcohol refusal and safe sex behavioral intentions and self-efficacy; 2) a parent Motivational Interview to address parental monitoring and supervision and alcohol- and sex-related family communication; and, 3) an additional module designed to address acculturation conflicts between parents and adolescents, to restore the protective factors of familismo and respeto, and increase adolescents' ethnic identity and pride. A three-phase top-down research approach to adapt, refine, and pilot test the preventative intervention will be conducted. Phase I will include focus groups with Hispanic adolescents and parents and initial manual development. Phase II will include therapist training, an open pilot trial, qualitative exit interviews, and further manual revisions. Phase III will inclde a small-randomized clinical trial with 75 families recruited and randomly assigned to a culturally specific HIV prevention intervention, a standard HIV prevention intervention, or an assessment only condition. Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary indication of a reduction in HIV risk behavior and alcohol use will be examined at 3- and 6-month follow-ups.

"College Students as Facilitators to Reduce Adolescent Obesity Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Appalachian region has a population of 23 million residing in 420 counties and 13 states. Forty-two percent of the region's population is rural. Compared to other regions, people living in Appalachia were reported to face a heavier burden from chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. The proportions of obese high school students in Southern Appalachia are among the highest in the nation. Health risk habits including unhealthy eating and physical inactivity are often established during adolescence and may contribute significantly to this chronic disease disparity. Although adolescent obesity is an urgent public health issue, effective interventions are few. Therefore, we propose to test an academia-community partnership approach using college students as facilitators to prevent obesity among adolescents. The long-term goal is to establish an effective academia-community partnership program to address adolescent obesity disparity in Southern Appalachia. The specific aims are: 1) To develop a peer- based health education program focusing on establishing positive peer norms and supportive peer relationships toward healthy eating and physical activity among high school students, 2) To test the efficacy of the program, and 3) To explore the mechanisms underlying the program. Twelve (six per each semester) undergraduates at East Tennessee State University will be trained to conduct an eleven-week peer-based health education program as peer facilitators. A cluster-randomized trial design will be used and 6 rural high schools will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. Approximately 1440 adolescents will be included as study subjects. Body mass index (BMI) percentile, dietary behavior, and physical activity among the study subjects will be assessed pre-intervention, at the end of the intervention, and 12 months post-intervention. Mean levels and/or prevalence of differences in the assessments (BMI percentile, obesity status, eating behavior, and physical activity) will be compared between the intervention and control group at the 3 time points (pre-intervention, end of intervention, and 12 months post-intervention). Peer group norms, body image, supportive peer relationships, role modeling, behavioral control/self-efficacy, attitudes, and intentions toward healthy eating and physical activity will be assessed pre-intervention, at the end of the intervention, and 12 months post-intervention. The roles of these factors as mediators of the intervention in modifying adolescents' eating and physical activity behaviors, as well as, body mass index will be examined. This proposed study will provide an important evaluation of an academia-community partnership using college students as facilitators to address adolescent obesity disparity in Southern Appalachia. If proven effective, the proposed program can meet the critical community needs for adolescent obesity prevention by engaging higher education institutes and students in service and fostering within them an ethic of civic responsibility. The program will be easily transferable from research to action without substantial additional resources and will be a sustainable win-win program for both the community and the academy. 1       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed study will provide an important evaluation of a peer-based program.

This goal will be accomplished by two aims: AIM I is to develop an Internet-based version of the face-to-face Familias Unidas intervention (hereafter referred to as Internet-Based Familias Unidas); and AIM II is to evaluate the efficacy of Internet-Based Familias Unidas, relative to both face-to-face Familias Unidas and a community practice control condition, in preventing unprotected sexual behavior and drug use in a community sample of Hispanic adolescents living in Miami-Dade County. 270 Hispanic adolescents recruited from three high schools will be randomized using an urn design to one of three conditions: Internet-Based Familias Unidas, face-to-face Familias Unidas or Community Practice. Face-to-face Familias Unidas, a Hispanic-specific, family- centered intervention, has been found efficacious, relative to control conditions, in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior and drug use in two randomized clinical trials (Pantin et al., 2009; Prado et al., 2007).  Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Internet-Based Familias Unidas and face-to-face Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than Community Practice Control in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior over time; (H2) Internet-Based Familias Unidas and face-to-face Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than Community Practice Control in preventing adolescent drug use over time; (H3) Internet-Based Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than face-to-face Familias Unidas in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior over time; and (H4) Internet-Based Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than face-to-face Familias Unidas in preventing adolescent drug use over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Internet-Based Familias Unidas and face-to-face Familias Unidas on adolescent unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H2a) the effect of Internet-Based Familias Unidas and face-to- face Familias Unidas on adolescent drug use will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H3a) the effect of Internet-Based Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by participation rates; and (H4a) the effect of Internet-Based Familias Unidas on adolescent drug use will be partially mediated by participation rates.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the proposed study is to prevent and reduce HIV risk behaviors among Hispanic adolescents.

"Disparities in Health and Academics of Sexual Minorities in Urban Middle Schools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide among lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning (LGBQ) adolescents is a public health concern (Haas, et al., 2010). Recent research demonstrates that anti-LGB prejudice at school and among peers contributes to health risks for LGBQ teens (Russell, Kosciw, Horn, Saewyc, 2010).This project focuses on the experiences of urban, ethnically diverse LGBQ middle school adolescents - a vulnerable yet understudied population - and seeks to identify factors that contribute to risk and resilience for well-being an academic achievement in this group. The first study uses the BIAS MAP (Cuddy, Fiske & Glick, 2007) and draws on the developmental friendship literature (Hallinan & Williams, 1989) to systematically assess intergroup attitudes, peer relations, and school climate and test their impact on psychological and academic outcomes for both LGBQ and heterosexual students. Survey data will be collected from 800 Asian, Black, Latino and White boys and girls enrolled in 7th and 8th grades at several large urban schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). Participants will complete measures assessing their stereotypes, prejudices and behavioral tendencies toward various ethnic LGBQ individuals, their same - and cross-ethnic and cross-sexual orientation friendships, perceived vulnerability at school, and school ethnic diversity as well as students' psychosocial well-being and academic achievement. It is expected that positive intergroup attitudes and school climate, better cross ethnic/sexual orientation friendships and greater ethnic diversity will contribute to enhanced well- being and academic achievement of both LGBQ and heterosexual adolescents of various ethnic groups. The second study employs a well-established experimental paradigm to test whether observing LGB-based victimization impacts the well-being of heterosexual adolescents. Heterosexual Latino boys (n= 120) and Latina girls (n = 120) enrolled in 7th and 8th grades will take part in a virtual ball-tossing computer game called Cyberball (Williams, Cheung, & Choi, 2000) during which they witness a Latino/a lesbian, gay or bisexual student excluded or included in the game. Each participant will complete measures of psychological well-being (i.e., state self-esteem), stereotypes, prejudices and behavioral tendencies toward Latino lesbian, gay and bisexual students; friendships (e.g., number of LGB friends), and the degree to which the participant perceives sexual minority Latinos as in-group. It is expected that witnessing the exclusion of LGB youth perceived to be an in-group member will negatively affect the well-being of the heterosexual observer. A combination of cluster analysis, hierarchical linear modeling and SEM multiple group analysis will be used to test the hypotheses in both studies. Knowledge gained from this program of research can inform prevention and intervention programs suited for implementation in our nation's urban schools.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Suicide among lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning (LGBQ) adolescents is a public health concern and research traces the health risks for LGBQ teens to hostile environments. This project focuses on the experiences of urban, ethnically diverse LGBQ middle school adolescents and identifies factors that contribute to risk and resilience for their well-being and academic achievement. This project will also examines the consequences of witnessing anti-LGB victimization for heterosexual students and provide important empirical evidence to inform educational and social policy designed to ensure that all adolescents regardless of sexual orientation and ethnicity reach their full potential.            ",Disparities in Health and Academics of Sexual Minorities in Urban Middle Schools,8456790,F32HD075531,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Buffers ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Computers ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Health ', ' Horns ', ' Hostility ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Prejudice ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' self esteem ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Policies ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Students ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Social Impacts ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Friendships ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' racism ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Ensure ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Shapes ', ' Rivers ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' bully ', ' bullying ', ' psychosocial ', ' middle school ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Exclusion ', ' 7th grade ', ' seventh grade ', ' 8th grade ', ' eighth grade ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Social status ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Data ', ' Psychological Impact ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' public health relevance ', ' sexual minority ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F32,2013,49214,0.07790413346204494
"AMICA: Assessing Fit of Motivational Interviewing by Cultures with Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic adolescents experience more severe alcohol-related consequences due to their alcohol abuse and yet significantly fewer Hispanic adolescents receive alcohol treatment, particularly among justice-involved youth. Despite the level of research that has been conducted on motivational interviewing (MI) with mainstream samples, no published studies have investigated the efficacy of this brief, individual intervention with Hispanic adolescents. The overarching objective of this application is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief individual intervention (MI) for problem drinking behaviors with a sample of justice-involved Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents to determine if this intervention is differentially effective between Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents. Specifically, the first aim is to determine whether an MI intervention targeting alcohol abuse is effective at reducing alcohol use and related risk behavior in a sample of adolescent alcohol abusers. The second aim is to examine whether the effects of MI on problem drinking outcomes (e.g., alcohol problems, quantity of drinking, frequency of binging) are different between Hispanic versus Caucasian adolescents. Because it is important to determine the mechanisms that mediate the effects of MI and determine whether these mechanisms differ between Caucasian and Hispanic adolescents, the third aim is to examine whether group (Hispanic vs. Caucasian) moderates the meditational linkages in the overall model using a cross-groups approach to moderated mediation (Aiken, Stein, & Bentler, 1994; Bentler, 1995). To accomplish these aims, 453 Caucasian and Hispanic justice-involved alcohol abusing adolescents (ages 14-17) will be randomized to either two 60 minute MI interventions (one at baseline and a second, one week later) or an assessment only control condition (AO). All adolescents will receive behavioral assessments at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. The proposed research is expected to take a significant step towards reducing current racial/ethnic health disparities in alcohol treatment for Hispanic adolescents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the advances made in developing efficacious brief alcohol abuse interventions for mainstream adolescents, no studies have evaluated the efficacy of brief (2 session) individual alcohol abuse interventions for Hispanic adolescents. In the face of their higher need, but lower likelihood of receiving effective alcohol interventions, this research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a brief intervention, motivational interviewing (MI), with Hispanic adolescents. This research will also identify potential culturally-specific moderators in problem drinking outcomes following this brief intervention. This research will take a significant step towards reducing current racial/ethnic health disparities and improving alcohol treatment for Hispanic adolescents.

She has a Masters in Health Science from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Her broad long, term career goals are to 1)become a pioneer in the development of evidence- based transitional care strategies for adolescents with chronic illness and 2)to assess and develop practices to eliminate health disparities in transplantation. Her proposed project is directed toward the first of these goals. Research: In this project, Dr. Amaral proposes to address the important problem of poor allograft survival in adolescent kidney transplant recipients due to nonadherence. Her first aim is to conduct a single center phase II randomized controlled trial that will test the effectiveness of a peer mentoring program to improve medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) versus usual care in adolescents with kidney transplants. She will measure HRQOL by written survey and medication adherence by the Brief Medication Questionnaire and pharmacy refill data. Her second aim is to determine the mechanisms by which peer mentoring impacts medication adherence and HRQOL. Specifically, she hypothesizes that peer mentoring provides social support which increases patient self-efficacy and leads to positive health outcomes. Her proposed peer-mentoring program will be telephone-based, with e-communication as deemed mutually agreeable to mentors and mentees. This approach is novel and practical, meeting patients in their ""real world."" Environment: The Emory-CHOA Pediatric Transplant Center is one of the busiest in the country, providing a rich population of patients for Dr. Amaral's single center proposal. Dr. Amaral has formed a solid team of mentors from the Dept. of Pediatrics (Dr. Larry Greenbaum), Dept. of Transplant Surgery (Dr. Allan Kirk) and School of Public Health (Dr. Arriola and Prof. Easley) to facilitate her success. Dr. Arriola has research experience with peer mentoring, having developed a program of patient navigators for African American women with breast cancer. The Rollins School of Public Health offers several relevant courses to Dr. Amaral's career development. The Department of Pediatrics is committed to the success of young investigators, providing support for statistical analysis, grantsmanship and manuscript preparation as well as opportunities to engage with the research community through the Pediatric Research Center. This project's aims are directed at improving the health of adolescents with solid organ transplants by improving medication adherence and consequently long-term allograft function. Patients who maintain functioning transplants have better quality of life and live longer than those who have failed grafts and return to dialysis. This project's aims are well matched to the NIH's mission to supportive investigative efforts to improve health and save lives.     Adolescents with chronic disease are at increased risk for nonadherence as they become young adults. This study will compare adherence and health related quality of life outcomes in two groups of adolescents with kidney transplants: those who receive peer mentoring vs. those who do not, using a primarily telephone-based approach with e-communication tailored to the mentee's interests and resources. Scientific knowledge gained from this study can be used to inform other adolescent chronic disease programs and to prevent allograft loss in adolescents with kidney transplants.

"Project LOVE: Preventing Adolescent Dating Violence among Rural African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent dating violence (ADV) continues to be a major public health problem. The need to address and prevent ADV has received notable attention in recent years. Although it has been documented that ADV occurs at an alarming rate among teens from all backgrounds, there are particular disparities among those who are African American and live in rural communities. My NCMHD Disparities Research and Education Advancing Mission (DREAM) Career Transition Award (K22) is entitled: Project LOVE: Preventing Adolescent Dating Violence among Rural African Americans. As the name implies, the focus of the K22 is to gain additional training and research experience necessary to become an independent prevention researcher who can design, conduct and evaluate community-based intervention trials to prevent ADV among rural African Americans. My academic, clinical, teaching, and research experiences to date have prepared me to successfully enter my next phase of career development. I have received excellent preparation in the areas of mental health, ADV, community-based participatory research (CBPR), and qualitative research design and data analysis. This preparation occurred through my doctoral training in Counseling Psychology, Postdoctoral Fellowship in Public Health, W. K. Kellogg Health Scholars Fellowship in Health Disparities and CBPR, and current faculty position at GUMC. As a psychologist, I have had the opportunity to work clinically with a diverse group of clients. I have provided individual, couples, family, and group therapy. In regards to teaching, I have taught and/or co-taught numerous Psychology and Public Health courses. Some of the relevant courses are: adolescent mental health, counseling early adolescents, human development, cross cultural counseling, music therapy, CBPR, and health education. These courses in one way or another all relate to and/or have informed my research program. In addition to strong institutional support, the institutional environment in which I will complete the extramural phase of the K22 award (i.e., Georgetown University, Georgetown University Medical Center, Department of Psychiatry, and The Georgetown Center for Trauma and the Community) coupled with my community partners far exceed those necessary to carry out my proposed career development and research plans. Over the past six years, I have also engaged in multiple research projects aimed at eliminating health disparities. These projects have involved extensive community engagement and collaboration. My current and future research program is designed to use CBPR to decrease health disparities by preventing ADV among African American youth in rural settings. Two critical components of the research are: (a) an examination of social, ecological, and cultural factors that impact ADV, and (b) an examination of the association of ADV with both mental and sexual health. The proposed K22 research plan will build upon my previous research to enable the design and pilot testing of a community-based, culturally-appropriate, effective, and sustainable ADV prevention intervention for rural, African American youth. Thus, my K22 career development goals focus on the development of competence in: Goal 1: research skills focusing on quantitative methods and data analysis and grant writing; Goal 2: racial/ethnic and rural health disparities, which will inform the conceptualization, design and conduct of culturally and geographically appropriate research; Goal 3: the development and implementation of community-based interventions; and Goal 4: the design, conduct, and evaluation of community-based intervention trials. These goals will be accomplished through a comprehensive plan that includes mentoring, expert consultation, community partner collaboration, coursework, instructional programs, tutorials, conference attendance, presentations, publication writing, and teaching. The Project LOVE research plan will build upon previous research by further developing a community-academic partnership that will guide the design and evaluation of an ADV prevention intervention for rural African American adolescents. The following research question guides the study: How can CBPR be used to design and pilot test an ADV prevention intervention appropriate for rural African American adolescents? Our specific aims are: Aim #1: To further develop and evaluate the Project LOVE community-academic partnership and community advisory board. Successful completion of this aim will increase partnership research capacity; Aim #2: To design a culturally and geographically appropriate community-based ADV prevention intervention for rural African American adolescents aged 10-14; Aim #3: To assess the acceptability of the intervention through the use of focus group interviews; and Aim#4: To pilot test the intervention to evaluate the feasibility and of intervention design. My previous and current research, coupled with the proposed K22 career development and research plans will provide the knowledge and skills necessary to successfully design, conduct, and evaluate a community-based intervention trial, thereby marking my transition to independent investigator status.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescent dating violence continues to be a major public health problem. Particular disparities exist among adolescents who are African American and live in rural communities. This application includes a career development and research plan that focuses on reducing health disparities by preventing dating violence among rural African American adolescents.

"Live Smart Live Safe: HIV Prevention for Youth with Intellectual Disabilities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to develop and evaluate the feasibility of an interactive, web-based HIV prevention curriculum for youth with intellectual disabilities (ID) (I.Q. approximately 55 through 70). A recent longitudinal study of male and female youth with disabilities reports that, by the time they were 18 or older (i.e., 18-21), 73% reported they had had sexual intercourse.1 Many youth with disabilities do not receive instruction on sexual health.2 This Phase I will focus on healthy relationship development and basic HIV knowledge. The Phase I program, ""HIV Prevention for Youth with ID"" will be tailored by age (11-14), gender, and sexual preference. Four content segments will be developed in Phase I prototype: 1) motivational segment for adolescents that normalizes sexuality and sexual health, a) healthy relationship development b) practices associated with abstinence, and c) transmission of HIV through high-risk body fluids. This project is consistent with the mission of the National Institute of Mental Health Division of AIDS Research (DAR), which supports proposals designed to prevent HIV transmission among at-risk populations. The predictive risk factors for HIV infection among people with intellectual disabilities (ID) are: a) high rates of sexual abuse3, 4 and sexual assault,5 b) information processing difficulties,6 and c) low literacy rates. 7  In Phase I, formative procedures with teachers and service providers (i.e., telephone interviews) will be used to identify youth knowledge of healthy relationships, abstinence, and HIV risk issues unique to youth with ID (e.g., lack of knowledge, socially-appropriate responding, unstable relationships) to inform program content, scriptwriting, and framing. A total of ten teachers and service providers will complete the telephone interviews. Focus groups with youth with ID (n= 8 females and n=8 males) will be conducted to identify knowledge and skill deficits associated with healthy relationship development, abstinence practices, and HIV transmission. The program will be pilot-tested with 10 youth with ID. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, the Phase I program will be evaluated with youth with ID (n=20 girls and n=20 boys). In addition, teachers, and service providers (n=15) will review the program to provide feedback on six areas of consumer satisfaction: ease of use, usefulness, interest, comprehensibility, acceptability, and persuasiveness.  At Phase II, the program will be expanded to address taking responsibility for condom usage (i.e., what a condom is, where to purchase them, keeping them handy, how to put a condom on a penis), relationship-based HIV avoidance strategies and getting tested for HIV. In addition, a teaching guide will be developed to accompany the final Phase II product. The Phase II product will be a downloadable web-based program for use on personal computers, iPad(R), and other tablet based technologies, suitable for use by adolescents with ID.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In 2010, 26% of new HIV infections occurred in youth between the ages of 13 to 24;8 and there is evidence that suggests the prevalence of HIV in people with intellectual disabilities (ID) is similar to, if not greater than, that of the non-ID population.7 In the health disparity literature, the sexual health needs of people with ID are overlooked in public health campaigns.2,9                ",Live Smart Live Safe: HIV Prevention for Youth with Intellectual Disabilities,8603172,R43MH102136,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Body Fluids ', ' Computers ', ' Consumer Satisfaction ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' male ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' penis ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sexuality ', ' tablet (pharmacologic) ', ' Tablets ', ' Target Populations ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching Method ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Comprehension ', ' Personal Computers ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' teacher ', ' disability ', ' sexual attack ', ' assaulted sexually ', ' sexual assault ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Intellectual limitation ', ' Intellectual disability ', ' Intellectual functioning disability ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' interactive multimedia ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV risk ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Program Reviews ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' remediation ', ' Prevalence ', ' fourteen year old ', ' age 14 years ', ' 14 year old ', ' Abstinence ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NIMH,TECH ASSISTANCE INST/INTELLECTUAL DISABL,R43,2013,257555,0.024715764877735445
"ACTION PAC: Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition & Physical Activity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The childhood obesity epidemic has led to the rising prevalence of cardiometabolic risks in adolescents. These risks include abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and pre-diabetes, the clustering of which is known as metabolic (or insulin resistance) syndrome. Longitudinal data show that children and adolescents with metabolic syndrome are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes. This is especially worrisome for youth in New Mexico, a culturally diverse state with 44.9% Hispanics and 9.7% American Indians, because obesity disproportionately affects these populations. School-based health centers (SBHCs) offer an important venue to expand healthcare access for adolescents, who are traditionally hard-to- reach. SBHCs provide health services to all students, with a focus on the uninsured and underserved and may be the only point of intervention for low-income and minority youth. The proposed R01 study will build upon significant findings from a NIH/NHLBI funded R21 study that utilized a community-based participatory research approach to develop and pilot-test a SBHC weight management program called Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition and Physical Activity (ACTION) with two high schools. ACTION was based on the use of motivational interviewing (MI) to support adoption of healthier eating and physical activity behaviors. In this current proposal (ACTION PAC), we propose to collaborate with eight high schools that have SBHCs to evaluate the broader reach and efficacy of using MI-based approaches to prevent and treat overweight/obesity and to decrease the risk of metabolic syndrome development. Specifically, our goals are to 1) prevent the development of overweight and obesity among students with BMI <85th percentile, 2) reduce BMI z score and insulin resistance in students with BMI >=85th percentile, and 3) obtain student and parent feedback on their experience with school-based BMI screening and weight management. To test the efficacy of these MI-based approaches, we will employ a cluster randomized control trial design in which four of the eight high schools will be randomized to an intervention group and the other four high schools will be randomized to a usual care comparison group. 960 participants in the 9th and 10th grades between the ages of 14-17 years will be followed annually for two years (until their 11th and 12th grade, respectively). Analyses will be conducted in a multilevel framework to account for clustering within schools. Baseline and 2nd year comparisons within group and comparison of change between the intervention and comparison groups will be assessed. The collective impact of these research outcomes will advance the field of school-based obesity intervention studies and take a significant step towards identifying sustainable prevention and treatment approaches for adolescent obesity and metabolic syndrome through the use of SBHCs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Healthy People 2020 has set objectives to: 1) increase the proportion of health care providers who regularly assess body mass index (BMI) in their adolescent patients, 2) increase the proportion of health care visits that include counseling related to nutrition, weight and physical activity, 3) reduce the proportion of adolescents who are obese, 4) prevent inappropriate weight gain in youth, 5) improve adolescent diet to include more fruits, vegetable and whole grains and less fats and added sugars, and 6) increase the proportion of adolescents who are physically active. The proposed project, ACTION PAC (Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition and Physical Activity), will address all of the above objectives by evaluating a method to motivate high school students to eat healthier, be physically active and achieve or maintain a healthy weight. Primary health care providers in school-based health centers will assess adolescents' BMI and work with them to adopt healthier behaviors to prevent access weight gain and assist those who are

"Early Life Determinants of Accelerated Pubertal Development in Adolescent Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Kubo's long-term career goal is to understand early-life determinants of cancer risk factors that relate to obesity and metabolic dysregulation, and to identify high-risk sub-populations that can benefit from early intervention strategies. Her primary research aim is to examine whether factors such as intrauterine exposure to maternal gestational diabetes (GDM), excessive gestational weight gain, obesity, and rapid infant weight gain increase the risk of accelerated pubertal onset in adolescent girls, an important breast and reproductive cancer risk factor. Her secondary aim is to explore the causes of the observed racial/ethnic differences in timing of puberty. No previous studies have examined these associations. These research goals will take advantage of electronic health data that are available in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated health plan that covers about 450,000 girls. Two specific approaches are proposed: 1. Linkage of mothers' and daughters' electronic health data in an on-going prospective study of predictors of sexual maturation in adolescent girls (U01 ES/CA019435) (Study 1); and, 2. Establishment of a new cohort of 20,000 multiethnic mother-daughter pairs using the electronic databases within KPNC (Study 2). Study 1 will utilize data from the CYGNET study (PI: Lawrence H. Kushi, ScD), which has been following 444 girls annually since 2005 with extensive information on pubertal development and anthropometric measures. The KPNC GDM and Pregnancy Glucose Tolerance Registry (Director: Assiamira Ferrara, MD, PhD) will be linked to the CYGNET data to accomplish study 1. In addition, the Registry will be used to establish a new cohort of mother-daughter pairs. This will allow Dr. Kubo gain experience and skills in establishing and follow a cohort based on KPNC electronic medical record data, and to explore racial/ethnic differences in pubertal onset. Electronic documentation of Tanner stage (an established five-stage classification scheme to assess pubertal development) from routine pediatric visits has recently been implemented at KPNC, and this availability on a large and diverse pediatric population makes this study unique and innovative. The candidate's research goals will be complemented with formal, mentored training through coursework and tailored tutorials in pediatric endocrinology, intergenerational transmission of metabolic dysregulation, advanced biostatistics, cancer prevention and health disparities, and responsible conduct of research. KPNC's Division of Research is an ideal environment for the proposed training because it provides unique and extensive electronic databases, access to data from a large, multiethnic membership, and internationally-recognized multidisciplinary experts. The planned scientific training and mentorship will build on the candidate's previous training in nutrition and cancer epidemiology, and uniquely position her to attain her goals. The proposed studies will provide crucial skills in establishing a new cohort, providing a platform for Dr. Kubo to develop successful R01 research to further elucidate early life determinants of pubertal onset and other cancer risk factors.              PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past century, adolescent girls have been maturing significantly earlier in the United States, with substantial racial/ethnic differences. Early-maturing girls are at risk for a variety of negative health outcomes, including increased risk of breast and other reproductive cancers, though aside from obesity, little is known as to what early life factors influence the timing of pubertal development. The proposed research will allow me to better understand early determinants of accelerated pubertal development in girls and to identify high risk populations, which can inform future effective upstream cancer prevention strategies.",Early Life Determinants of Accelerated Pubertal Development in Adolescent Girls,8443286,K07CA166143,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Affect ', '

"Development of a Syndemic Model Among Gay/Bisexual Male Adolescents/Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The training goal of this career development grant is to become an independent scientific investigator contributing to the understanding of the social processes through which gay and bisexual male adolescents and emerging adults (GBMAEA) develop a range of health disparities, including HIV/AIDS, depression, and substance use. These processes require investigation in order to inform the development of multilevel and structural interventions to eliminate these disparities. In order to achieve these goals, I propose to develop and apply skills in the areas of adolescent development, psychosocial scale development and validation, latent class analysis and mixed models. Dr. Gary Harper will oversee my professional development under this proposal. In addition to supervising my progress through the proposed research and training plan, Dr. Harper will supervise my training in two areas of skill development: qualitative data analysis methods and adolescent development theories and applications. Dr. Isa Fernandez will act as a co-mentor and senior methodologist working with me on secondary data analysis, sampling and recruitment methods and supervision of my grantsmanship and R01 proposal development. Dr. Richard Campbell will act as a co-mentor and supervise my training in statistical methods, including psychosocial scale validation, item response analysis, latent class analysis, and mixed models. Dr. Ron Stall will act as a co- mentor and supervise my training in developing and testing a model of syndemic production of HIV/AIDS and health disparities. The goal of the proposed research is to empirically test a model of syndemic production of negative health outcomes among GBMAEA, and to investigate possible resiliencies among this population that are associated with positive health outcomes. I will assess (a) how these male adolescents and emerging adults perceive, experience and internalize gay-related stigma, (b) how sexual identity development is correlated with the perception, experience, and internalization of gay-related stigma, (c) to what degree these stigma processes and sexual identity development are associated to a range of health risk indicators, and (d) to what degree perceived social support moderates the effects of stigma and sexual identity development on health behaviors. This application supports the mission of the National Institute of Mental Health by producing data on sexual identity development trajectories, gay-related stigma, and health behaviors of GBMAEA that will help inform the development of theoretically sound multi-level and structural interventions in the future to address HIV/AIDS and health disparities among this population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the U.S., men who have sex with men are affected by marked health disparities, including elevated rates of HIV infection, substance use, and depression, that may be syndemically produced as responses to marginalization during adolescence. The research component of this career development grant will develop and test a syndemic model among gay and bisexual male adolescents and emerging adults (GBMAEA). This application supports the mission of the National Institute of Mental Health by producing data on sexual identity development trajectories, gay-related stigma, and health behaviors of GBMAEA that will help inform the development of theoretically sound multi-level and structural interventions in the future to address HIV/AIDS and health disparities among this population.

"Alcohol, Marijuana, and Risky Sex: Group Interventions with Detained Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescents are at great risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including HIV/AIDS, and are one of few HIV risk groups for whom HIV/AIDS incidence is not declining (CDC, 2005a). Compared to the general adolescent population, adolescents involved with the criminal justice system are younger at first intercourse, have a greater number of sex partners, and lower rates of condom use, resulting in higher rates of unintended pregnancy and STDs (e.g., Teplin, Mericle, McClelland & Abram, 2003). Data from our previous research efforts suggests that it is heavy alcohol use in concert with sexual activity, rather than heavy alcohol use generally, that is most strongly related to lack of condom use (Bryan, Ray, & Cooper, in press). Further, we have demonstrated initially higher rates of condom use at follow-up among adolescents who participated in a combined sexual risk reduction + alcohol risk reduction intervention as compared to a sexual risk reduction only intervention and an information only control intervention in our prior NIAAA-supported randomized controlled intervention with incarcerated adolescents, (R01 AA013844-01; Schmiege, Broaddus, Bryan, et al., 2008). The goal of the proposed study is to build on those successful findings, and on our ongoing work (RO1 DA019139-01) and that of others (Lebeau-Craven et al., 2003; Kingree & Betz, 2003) which suggests that marijuana use is more prevalent than alcohol use generally and during sex than is alcohol use among criminally-involved adolescents. In addition, NIDA has noted that marijuana is a specific drug of abuse that may be an emerging risk factor for HIV and STDs, but one for which there is little basic or intervention research. In this continuation, we propose to conduct a second randomized controlled trial to compare an expanded sexual risk reduction intervention that includes both an alcohol component and a marijuana component, to a sexual risk reduction intervention that includes only an alcohol component, and a sexual risk reduction only condition. Each of these interventions includes a standard theory-based didactic presentation of sexual reduction intervention material and a group motivational enhancement therapy component focused on alcohol and marijuana, alcohol use only, or sexual risk behavior only. We hope to show that: 1) combining both substances into one intervention further increases its efficacy at decreasing sexual risk behavior because of its broad coverage of the three most highly prevalent risk behaviors (alcohol, marijuana, and unprotected sex) in this population, 2) it is the substance use content, and not the group MET modality that is responsible for this increased efficacy, and 3) the intervention exerts its effects through theoretically-based mediators. The relative success of these interventions will have implications for HIV/STD risk reduction programming for high risk adolescents in the criminal justice system.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescents involved with the criminal justice system are younger at first intercourse, have a greater number of sex partners, and lower rates of condom use than their non criminally-involved counterparts. This high level of sexual risk results in higher rates of unintended pregnancy and STDs including HIV/AIDS. These young people also have extraordinarily high rates of alcohol and marijuana use, and many have demonstrated that substance use plays a causal role in sexual risk. This research is designed to implement and carefully evaluate new intervention technologies that have the goal of decrease alcohol- and marijuana-related sexual risk behavior in this population of highly vulnerable young people.

"A Community-Academic Partnership to Address Disparities in Obesity Among Youth     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over one-third of US adolescents are obese or overweight, and large racial/ethnic disparities exist in obesity/ overweight rates. In the racially/ethnically diverse Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), the second largest US school district and the community partner for this application, obesity and overweight prevalence (46%) is higher than the national average, und Black and Latino students have the highest prevalence. We have partnered with LUUSD to translate obesity policy into practice through NlMHD's R24 community-based participatory research (CBPR) Planning and Intervention Grants, for which we developed, pilot tested, and conducted a randomized controlled trial of our middle-school-based obesity prevention intervention, Students for Nutrition and exercise (SNaX). In this Dissemination Phase application, we seek funds to transition the intervention from research to practice. SNaX is a multi-level intervention that includes changes to the school food environment (e.g., sliced fruit and vegetable offerings; informational signage; free water at lunchtime), peer advocacy, and school-wide multimedia promotion. Our RCT results showed that SNaX is both effective at increasing healthy eating and cost-effective, and thus meets criteria as an evidence-based program worthy of dissemination. The specific aims are to use a theory-driven strategy and CBPR principles: 1) to synthesize and disseminate information about adolescent obesity prevention in general and SNaX in particular to community and academic stakeholders; 2) to enhance the general organizational and program- specific capacity of LAUSD to implement SNaX and maintain delivery of SNaX beyond the project period; 3) to disseminate and implement the SNaX program in LAUSD middle schools; and 4) to evaluate the SNeX dissemination and implementation process, including the domains of program reach, recruitment, efficacy, adoption, retention, implementation fidelity, and maintenance. We plan to use an iterative process, in which we initially launch dissemination in LAUSD's North region. We will evaluate and refine the dissemination process using a validated framework that includes program facility checklists, debriefing interviews with staff and students, and analyses of cafeteria records and physical fitness data. After the dissemination test, LAUSD plans to implement SNaX in middle schools across the rest of the district. Ultimately, we intend to find ways to disseminate SNaX more broadly, using lessons learned from the LAUSD dissemination process to guide entry into other school districts. Our goal is to bring obesity prevention out of the research realm and into communities, and thereby achieve enduring real-world changes in public health through the reduction and eventual elimination of disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of obesity and overweight among US adolescents remains high, with substantial disparities by race/ethnicity. In partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAESD) and community stakeholders, we developed; pilot tested, and conducted a randomized controlled trial if Students for Nutrition and eXercise (SNaX), an obesity prevention intervention that aims to reduce racial/ethnic disparities. We propose to partner with LAUSD to disseminate and implement SNaX in LAUSD middle schools and maintain implementation of SNaX in LAUSD beyond the project period.                ",A Community-Academic Partnership to Address Disparities in Obesity Among Youth,8556592,R24MD001648,"['Adoption ', ' Boston ', ' Budgets ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Maintenance ', ' Marketing ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' nutrient requirement ', ' Nutritional Requirements ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Physical Fitness ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Sales ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Department of Agriculture (U.S.) ', ' United States Department of Agriculture ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Physical activity ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Policies ', ' Food Policy ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' meetings ', ' middle school ', ' empowered ', ' drinking water ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Slice ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' environmental change ', ' obesity prevention ', ' soft drink ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' nineteen year old ', ' age 19 years ', ' 19 year old ', ' Evidence based program ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' research into practice ', ' research to practice ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' food environment ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R24,2013,795309,0.02268533487797483
"Risk, Roles and Relationships: Project Prepared DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a two-group randomized trial of Project Prepared, an HIV/STI prevention program for youth aged 12-14. It folds together elements of three interventions we designed for middle adolescents into a comprehensive intervention that is developmentally appropriate for youth in early adolescence. Project Prepared has two parts. First is a 14-session training program held over 7 weeks that covers five major predictors of high risk behavior: developmental na¿vet¿, cognitive factors, gender roles, relationship factors and family formation. It is followed by a 5-week internship that incorporates resilience and youth development through making youth peer educators to other adolescents about HIV/STI risk. Project Prepared is theoretically based, comprehensive, intensive, and appropriate to the developmental stage, race/ethnicity, and social context of inner-city youth of color. It emphasizes skills in avoiding risky sexual situations, and provides medically accurate information about sexual development, sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy. We will conduct a two group randomized trial (n=400) to test the effectiveness of Project Prepared on cognitive factors (HIV/STI knowledge, sexual self-efficacy; intention to use a condom); relationship factors (immature romantic beliefs, relationship self-efficacy), gender norms (macho man, powerless female), and resilience. The control condition will be TEEN, an award winning program with proven effectiveness in reducing psychological symptoms with no HV/STD content.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black and Latino youth are at particular risk for HIV/STIs, but currently available interventions for young adolescents have shown only modest, short term effects. We have developed an intensive, comprehensive HIV/STI prevention program, for youth aged 12-14, Project Prepared. The project is expected to generate important information on sexual risk behavior in early adolescents, and may lead to a new program that is effective in reducing HIV/STI risk for youth in the future.","Risk, Roles and Relationships: Project Prepared",8472507,R01HD062079,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency

"Health Disparities in Obesity: Partner Violence and its Psychosocial Pathways    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this R03 is to examine whether adolescent exposure to IPV increases risk of obesity in young adulthood and whether depressive symptoms, health behaviors or C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, mediate this relationship. Our central hypothesis is that IPV exposure in adolescence leads to increased adiposity (body mass and waist circumference) from adolescence to adulthood. We will test this hypothesis using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Among the 10,120 respondents who participated in all 4 waves of data collection, we will use structural equation modeling to examine the relationship between IPV and adiposity and whether this relationship is mediated by depressive symptoms, weight promoting health behaviors, and inflammation. We will also explore whether these direct and indirect relationships differ by race/ethnicity, sex, prior exposure to child maltreatment, and characteristics of the relationship, namely whether the violence is bi-directional (both partners use violence against the other) or uni-directional. This project supports our long-term goal of contributing evidence on the mechanisms linking early violence exposure to chronic disease in adulthood to highlight at risk populations and points of intervention at which health disparities may be mitigated.         The proposed study has high public health relevance as it will yield important information about the pathways by which intimate partner violence (IPV) may lead to obesity. IPV and obesity are both major public health problems characterized by disparities that are apparent in adolescence. Knowledge of their relationship could inform cross-cutting upstream interventions geared toward violence and obesity prevention.

"Measuring Daily Experiences of Racial Discrimination in African American Youth     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans' experiences with racial discrimination have been implicated in several types of mental and physical health pathology during the adolescent period, including substance use, psychological symptoms, and externalizing behaviors. These problems not only disrupt normative developmental processes during adolescence, but also contribute to race-based health disparities in adulthood for African Americans. However, methodological problems related to measurement of the timing, context, and content of racial discrimination experiences substantially limit the ability to understand the role of racial discrimination in the daily lives and overall health of African American youth. In order to improve measurement and to promote synergy between theory and psychometric instrumentation, this grant will develop and validate a quantitative measure of experienced racial discrimination for use in longitudinal substance use and public health research with African American adolescents. This measure will improve the current state of racial discrimination research with African American adolescents by: 1) utilizing daily diary measurement to minimize retrospective bias; 2) including an array of contexts common in the lives of African American adolescents (e.g., school, internet, athletics); and 3) incorporating a mixed-method approach to validating the content of the measure. In this way, the proposed research project will take an innovative multidimensional, comprehensive, and mixed-method approach to developing a daily measure of experienced racial discrimination for use with African American adolescents.  The ultimate goal of the current research and training fellowship application is to prepare the applicant to become an independent researcher with expertise in the field of experienced racial discrimination and health disparities for African American youth. The specific goals of this fellowship are: 1) to expand the applicant's knowledge of the experience of racial discrimination for African American adolescents; 2) to increase the applicant's skills in psychometric measure development; and 3) to educate the applicant in advanced quantitative analysis. The applicant will achieve these goals by engaging in multidisciplinary coursework, professional collaboration and mentorship, and research conferences and publications. These activities will enable the applicant to execute his fellowship and dissertation research aims of developing, validating, and disseminating a measure of experienced racial discrimination for use in daily, longitudinal substance use and public health research with African American adolescents.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American adolescents' experience of racial discrimination is linked to substance use, depression, and a myriad of other health problems that persist into adulthood. However, weaknesses in current measurement limit the understanding of the frequency, types, and health consequences of racial discrimination for these youth, making it difficult to design and evaluate culturally-relevant and developmentally-appropriate interventions. The goal of this fellowship is to prepare the applicant to become an interdisciplinary researcher with expertise in the measurement of experienced racial discrimination who can contribute to the reduction of African American adolescent mental and physical health disparities linked to racial discrimination. !            ",Measuring Daily Experiences of Racial Discrimination in African American Youth,8595972,F31DA036288,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Stone ', ' Biliary or Urinary Stones ', ' Calculi ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' instrumentation ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pathology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Formulation ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' skills ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Athletic ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health research ', ' ']",NIDA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2013,40306,0.02048687998424059
"Treatment for Latino/a Adolescents with Suicidal Behavior     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching career goal of Yovanska Duarte-Velez, Assistant Research Scientist, at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras Campus (UPR-RP), is to become an independent mental health researcher in clinical interventions for suicidal adolescents and their families, with a specialization in Latino populations. One of her future objectives is to conduct multisite clinical trials of innovative treatments in Puerto Rico ad the United States. Her specific career goals are: 1) develop research skills to conduct randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in real world settings with high risk adolescents; 2) develop research skills to conduct cross-cultural and health disparity research in multisite studies; 3) gain knowledge of procedures to assess observable family variables and neurobehavioral and neurocognitive markers that may prove to be underlying mechanisms of change in treatment outcomes for suicidal adolescents and incorporate these measures in treatment research; and 4) improve knowledge of and gain experience with statistical analyses used in treatment research. These goals will be achieved through: 1) Drs. Spirito (RCT with suicidal adolescents) and Bernal's (Latino mental health) mentorship; 2) consultations with Drs. Canino (multisite & cross-cultural research), Alegria (health disparities & cross-cultural research), Goldston (intervention development), Stout (statistical methods) and Dickstein (neurobehavioral and neurocognitive mechanisms); 3) courses, seminars, workshops, and special training; and 4) execution of the proposed research project. The proposed award will be carried out at Brown University for the first two years and at UPR-RP for the last three years. The primary aim of the proposed research is to evaluate the feasibility of a socio-cognitive-behavioral therapy protocol for suicidal behavior (SCBT-SB protocol) with Latino/a adolescents. The Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) treatment protocol will include developmental and cultural factors in order to optimize treatment outcomes in suicidal Latino/a adolescents. Specifics aims are: 1) refine the treatment protocol to expand its applicability to Latino population in U.S. based on feedback from therapists working with Latino and suicidal adolescents in RI and on a small open trial; 2) develop and implement a training program for the protocol; and 3) conduct a pilot RCT of the SCBT-SB versus treatment as usual (TAU). This proposed project's public health significance is evident, as it addresses two Healthy People 2020 Objectives: MHMD HP2020-1: ""Reduce the suicide rate"" and MHMD HP-2: ""Reduce the rate of suicide attempts by adolescents."" Its clinical significance lies in the fact that there is little evidence of treatment efficacy for suicidal adolescents and there are evident disparities in the delivery of quality clinical services for Latio populations. Its scientific significance is that it tests the feasibility of a novel treatment apprach that aims to incorporate new perspectives relevant to Latino families and minority youth. It also addresses the third strategic objective of the NIMH, which is to: ""Develop new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illness.""         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Culturally sensitive treatment for suicidal minority youth and clinical investigators devoted to high suicide risk and underserved population are nearly absent. The proposed training grant allows Dr. Duarte-Velez to gain expertise in treatment development according to the needs and challenges faced by suicidal minority youths (e.g. ethnic, sexual) and their families. The primary aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the feasibility of a novel cognitive behavioral treatment protocol that integrates developmental and cultural factors to target suicidal behavior

"Factors Associated with Teens' Non-Responsiveness to HIV Intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am committed to a career in HIV/STD prevention research. To become a fully independent investigator, I am applying for the NIMH Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) to augment my training and research in HIV/STD prevention research for vulnerable adolescents. Towards this goal, I will participate in courses, workshops, seminars, and mentoring meetings to enhance my existing knowledge and research skills, and acquire new knowledge and research skills specific to the design, implementation, adaptation and evaluation of HIV/STD prevention programs for adolescents. My proposed research plan, to be conducted at Emory University and the Fulton County Department of Health and Wellness, in Atlanta, Georgia, with the guidance of my Mentors (Primary Mentor: R. DiClemente, Co-Mentors: G. Wingood and S. Kalichman), can contribute significantly to the field of adolescent HIV prevention science in substantive and practical ways. Study 1 is a mixed-method study patterned after research conducted by my Co-Mentor (Dr. Kalichman), designed to: 1) identify the proportion of African-American female adolescents exposed to an HIV intervention that do not change their condom use, and 2) describe the personal, behavioral and psychosocial factors associated with ""failure to change"" condom use following an HIV intervention. Data from Study 1 directly informs Study 2. In Study 2, I will adapt an existing effective gender and culturally tailored adolescent HIV intervention developed by my Mentors (Dr. DiClemente, & Dr. Wingood), to enhance its efficacy for promoting condom use among African-American female adolescents who did not change their condom use after participating in an HIV intervention. The adaptation process will be guided by a sequential and systematic adaptation model, developed by Drs. Wingood and DiClemente, to facilitate the adaptation process. Study 2 is also a pilot test of the effectiveness of the adapted SiHLE intervention for this subgroup of non-responsive adolescents. The findings from the two studies in this application will make significant contributions to our understanding of adolescent sexual risk behavior and the development of effective HIV interventions which could modify the risk trajectory for HIV acquisition in hard-to-change adolescents.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV prevention interventions tailored for African-American adolescent females who are non-responsive to sexual behavior risk-reduction interventions are urgently needed as these individuals are at especially high- risk for contracting HIV/STDs. The adoption of the adapted SiHLE intervention by other health departments and community-based AIDS service organizations has the potential to reach a broad audience and a population substantially impacted by the HIV epidemic.

"Linking Biological and Social Pathways to Adolescent Health and Well-Being     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Linking Biological and Social Pathways to Adolescent Health and Well-Being Abstract Research across disciplines provides strong evidence that exposure to chronic stress contributes to poor physical and mental health outcomes across the life course. Consequently, large-scale population studies have increasingly integrated the collection of biomarkers of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity (e.g. cortisol) to investigate the extent to which the neuroendocrine pathway explicates the role of chronic stress in shaping poor health outcomes and racial/ethnic and socioeconomic health disparities. However, few population studies have collected cortisol biomarkers from adolescents and among those that have, significant methodological challenges ultimately hampered data quality. Therefore, the purpose of this R21 proposal is to field test the collection of non-invasive longitudinal cortisol samples from adolescents to explore the validity and reliability of nightly measures of salivary cortisol for 6 nights and one hair sample for cortisol. The findings will determine if the collection of these measures is feasible and informative in a population of adolescents across a spectrum of social risk for impaired health. This R21 proposal is unique in that we will leverage a subsample of adolescents participating in the first wave of a recently funded prospective cohort study - the Adolescent Health and Development in Context (AHDC) study (PI Browning; NIH 1R01DA032371-01 and the William T. Grant Foundation). The AHDC study will examine the impact of spatial and social exposures on the risk behavior, victimization and mental health outcomes of 4,000 adolescents aged 11-17 years in Franklin County, Ohio. The specific aims of this R21 proposal are: Aim 1: To field test the collection of non-invasive biomarkers of cortisol in adolescents via nightly salivary samples for 6 nights and one hair sample and Aim 2: To examine the relationships between the (a) cortisol biomarkers; (b) immune function biomarkers (EBV DNA) and (c) linked secondary data from the AHDC study of adolescent risk behavior, psychosocial stressors, and environmental stressors. Our analytic strategy will employ advanced multilevel modeling techniques designed to estimate the variability in cortisol levels between and within individuals and the behavioral, psychosocial and environmental stressors associated with this variability. The findings of this R21 proposal will inform the selection of a high-quality, feasible and cost-effective biomarker data collection protocol to determine the biological impact of social risk on adolescent health and behavior in the second wave of the AHDC study. In addition, these data will inform the design of future population research studies to reduce adolescent health risk and disparities, with potential health benefits over the life course.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research will explore a high-quality, feasible and cost-effective protocol for the collection of cortisol biomarkers in population studies examining the biological impact of social risk on adolescent health, health behaviors, and health disparities. Findings from this research may help to elucidate the extent to which the neuroendocrine pathway explicates the role of chronic exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors in shaping poor health outcomes and racial and socioeconomic health disparities.                ",Linking Biological and Social Pathways to Adolescent Health and Well-Being,8430135,R21DA034960,"['abstracting ', ' suprarenal gland ', ' Adrenals ', ' Adrenal Glands ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Community Surveys ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Crime ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' virus DNA ', ' viral DNA ', ' human herpesvirus 4 group ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' Herpesvirus 4 (gamma), Human ', ' HHV-4 ', ' Epstein-Barr Virus ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' EBV ', ' EB virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' Household and Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Mails ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Ohio ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Pituitary Nervous System ', ' Pituitary ', ' Hypophysis Cerebri ', ' Hypophysis ', ' Pituitary Gland ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Saliva ', ' Schools ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Social Network ', ' Social Impacts ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Discipline ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Data Quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' Salivary ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' environmental stressor ', ' stressor ', ' trait ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Population Study ', ' Impaired health ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' Length ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Population Research ', ' Retrieval ', ' Collection ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NIDA,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,255194,0.09859937565446594
"Daily Experience in Adolescence and Biomarkers of Early Risk for Adult Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite calls for the identification of early risk factors for the development of chronic health conditions, there has been little longitudinal research on biomarkers of health that has been conducted in persons younger than 25 years of age. In addition, there is only a minimal understanding of how biological indices of early risk for adult health develop among adolescents with Latin American and Asian backgrounds, the two fastest rising ethnic groups in the United States, who are at differential risk for adverse health outcomes as compared to European Americans. An understanding of these processes is necessary for the development of ethnically and culturally relevant prevention efforts.  We propose a 3-wave longitudinal study of adolescents and their caregivers from Mexican, Chinese and European backgrounds in order to assess the impact of daily experience on biological indicators of early risk for adult health. Our focus on daily experience stems from the need to identify the mechanisms by which global social factors identified in demographic surveys, such as lower education and income, play themselves out in individuals' daily lives. Daily experiences such as social conflict, excessive demands, emotional distress, threat, and sleep behaviors have been shown to be linked to both global risk factors and multiple biological indices of health risk among adults.  The project will include both intensive behavioral assessments and detailed biological markers of health risk from both adolescents and their parents in order to address the following specific aims: (1) describe the development during adolescence of biological indices of early risk for adult health; (2) assess the role of daily experience in the development of early health risk; (3) examine the existence of ethnic disparities in early health risk; and (4) explore the role of potential protective factors in the development of early health risk.  Approximately 540 pairs of adolescents and primary caregivers (180 from each ethnic group) will be assessed when the adolescents are approximately 15-16, 17-18, and 19-20 years of age. Each year, both adolescents and caregivers will participate in interviews that include measures of global social factors such as socioeconomic background and potential protective factors such as social connectedness. Participants will report daily experiences using a nightly diary checklist for 9 consecutive days. Salivary cortisol will be obtained at 4 time points each day for 4 of these days in order to analyze HPA activity, and participants will wear wrist actigraphs for the same 4 days to measure objective sleep behaviors. Blood pressure, BMI, and waist/hip ratio will be assessed, and dried blood spots will be obtained for the assessment of c-reactive-protein (CRP), cholesterol, and high density lipoproteins (HDL). Finally, peripheral blood samples will be provided by a subsample of 120 families for the assessment of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and for gene expression analyses of molecular signaling pathways driving inflammatory biology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is only a minimal understanding of how biological indices of early risk for adult health develop among adolescents with Latin American and Asian backgrounds, the two fastest rising ethnic groups in the United States, who are at differential risk for adverse health outcomes as compared to European American. More in-depth examinations of the daily lives of adolescents from these populations could identify both the sources of these disparities as well as unique risk and protective factors. An understanding of these processes is necessary for the development of ethnically and culturally relevant prevention efforts.

"Social Ecology and the Prevention of Suicide and Aggression in African American Y     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This indicated prevention intervention trial employs a randomized controlled design to examine the efficacy of a 15-session, culturally tailored, cognitive-behavioral group prevention intervention for urban, low income African American adolescents. The PI successfully adapted the Coping with Stress Course (Clarke et al., 1995) to be culturally sensitive and appropriate for use with urban, low-income African American adolescents. This culturally-adapted intervention (i.e., the Adapted-Coping with Stress Course [Robinson & Case, 2003]) will be significantly revised to enhance individual competencies believed to mitigate the risk for self-directed (i.e., suicidality) and inter-personal aggression. n addition, the proposed study aims to examine how neighborhood and family ecological characteristics moderate the effects of a culturally-adapted, cognitive-behavioral coping with stress prevention intervention on African American adolescents' self-directed (i.e., suicidality) and interpersonal aggression.  This study is expected to have broad public health implications toward the reduction of African American youth health disparities and inform practice and policy on the development of effective violence prevention interventions for African American youth. It is expected that this study will inform a future large scale effectiveness study that will embed an evidence-based, culturally sensitive violence prevention intervention within a large urban school system.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is transformative and will provide vital knowledge pertaining to the understanding and prevention of African American youth violence, both self-directed and interpersonal.

"Testing a Latino web-based parent-adolescent sexual communication intervention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latino adolescents, especially those living in Puerto Rico, are at high risk for HIV/AIDS, other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unintended pregnancies. A web-based parent communication intervention provides an opportunity to benefit adolescents by providing additional support for safer sex decisions, and to increase parents' involvement in sexual health by decreasing barriers that keep them from participating in these interventions. The purpose of this proposed study is to evaluate a brief, theoretically informed, culturally appropriate, and linguistically tailored web-based parental communication program, Cu¿dalos (""Take care of them""), designed to improve parent-adolescent sexual communication and reduce adolescent sexual risk behavior. Recent findings from an R21 RCT testing a brief computer-based version of the Cu¿dalos program indicated that the program increased parent-adolescent general communication and sexual risk communication with English and Spanish speaking U.S. Latinos.7 In this proposed study, we plan to modify the Cu¿dalos intervention by changing to a web-based format, increasing the amount of content related to sexual communication and adding a module on HIV/AIDS stigma. In this RCT, we will recruit parents (n=680) and one of their adolescents (n=680) from community-based agencies in Puerto Rico, and will be randomly assigned to receive either the parent-based Cu¿dalos intervention or a web-based health promotion control condition. Parents and adolescents will complete measures at pre-intervention and at 3-(parents only), 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. We will address the five following specific aims: 1) Does the Cu¿dalos intervention increase parents' comfort with, as well as the amount of, communication with adolescents and decrease stigma at 3-,6-, and 12- month follow-ups as compared to the general health promotion control intervention; 2) Does the Cu¿dalos intervention decrease self-reported adolescent intercourse and unprotected intercourse at the follow-ups as compared to the general health promotion control intervention; 3) Do theory-based variables (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, intentions) mediate the intervention effects of Cu¿dalos on parents' communication with their adolescents; 4) Are the effects of the Cu¿dalos intervention on adolescent sexual behavior and parent-adolescent communication moderated by individual (adolescents: sexual experience, gender, age, stigma; parents: gender, age computer access/experience, frequency and time engaged in the program), and microsystem (adolescents: parent-adolescent communication) variables; and 5) Puerto Rican and Latino youth, the lack of culturally and linguistically effectiv interventions for Latino parents and adolescents, and the absence of web-based interventions for Latinos. If the program is efficacious, the web-based format will accelerate the translation of this program into public health practice and will be an important contribution in supporting safe adolescent sexual health behaviors. Is the intervention cost-effective? This study addresses existing disparities in sexual health outcomes among         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this study will provide an important resource to parents and adolescents to support adolescents' safer sex decisions. Results from testing and using a web-based format will provide important information for the development of future parent-adolescent sexual risk reduction programs and health related technology based interventions for this and other underserved populations.            ",Testing a Latino web-based parent-adolescent sexual communication intervention,8554321,R01NR013505,"['Age ', ' Attitude ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Programs ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Programmed Learning ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Test Result ', ' experience ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' microsystems ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' safer sex ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2013,381790,0.10281144923524847
"The Role of Place on the Co-occurrence of ATOD Use and Violence Among Youth     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Mentored Scientist Career Development Award (K01) that provides me the training and research experience necessary to develop an innovative research program focused on ATOD use and violent/aggressive behavior among youth. My research and professional career have focused on vulnerable populations of young people living in communities characterized by substantial health and social disparities. My primary research interest focuses on resiliency in the prevention of ATOD use and violent behavior among at-risk urban adolescents and young adults. This research interest stems from my experience as a Nurse Practitioner in school-based and community-based clinics with adolescents and young adults. To date, my program of research has focused on the healthy development of adolescents and prevention of risk behaviors, particularly youth violence. My long-term goal is to become an independent investigator in the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violent/aggressive behavior among youth, and the role of primitive factors in the healthy development of youth, specifically primitive factors within the neighborhood context (place). With my long- term goal in mind, my training and research objectives for the five-year award period are: 1) To develop expertise in ATOD use, the relationship between ATOD use and violent behavior, and their concomitant individual and neighborhood risk and primitive factors; 2) To expand my quantitative skills to examine for the effect of place (neighborhood) on adolescent ATOD use and the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence/aggression overtime; 3) To develop skills in intervention development, evaluation, and design; and 4) To advance my knowledge of the ethical conduct of intervention research with adolescents, including considerations regarding recruitment, data collection, management and security, and intervention. Training will include: graduate coursework in spatial-temporal analysis; short courses in intervention development and design and advanced multilevel modeling; mentored literature reviews on youth ATOD use, ATOD use and violence, and neighborhood effects of substance use among youth; participation in substance use interdisciplinary workgroups and meetings; mentorship in developing school and community partnerships for intervention research and translating research findings into interventions; and three mentored research projects. I will be mentored by experts in adolescent development, adolescent substance use, spatial analysis, and intervention development and implementation. Guided by a developmental-ecological perspective, I have proposed two secondary data analysis projects and one data collection project to address the following overarching research aims: 1) To examine the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence/aggression among urban youth; 2) To explore how place influences the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence; 3) To examine the relationship between future orientation, place, and the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence during adolescence; and 4) To develop an intervention and relevant measures that will be the basis for an R21 and future RCT R01. Using data from the NIDA-funded longitudinal Flint Adolescent Study (n = 850, PI: Zimmerman), the first project will focus on the trajectories of ATOD use and violent behavior over time, and will identify neighborhood characteristics that influence trajectories of ATOD use and violent behavior in a sample of urban youth. I will use dual trajectory growth curve analysis and cross-legged path analyses to explore the relationship between ATOD use and violence from age 14-32. Multilevel modeling analyses will be used to identify neighborhood characteristics that influence the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence. Using data from a county-wide school based survey (Coordinated Community Student Survey; C2S2); the second research project will focus on the relationship between future orientation, place, and the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violent behavior. I will use multi-group, multilevel SEM (ML-SEM) to examine differences in the relationship between future orientation and ATOD use/violent behavior based on neighborhood factors. The third study involves conducting a survey with a subsample of C2S2 youth (n = 500 6th grade students) for a more in-depth exploration of the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violent behavior, future orientation and its relationship to ATOD and violent behavior, and how place influence future orientation and ATOD use and violent behavior in a sample of urban youth. Measures, study design, and analyses will be determined based on knowledge, skills, and mentoring received as part of the training plan. In research projects 2 and 3, I will use spatial analytic techniques to examine the effects of place-based risk and primitive factors on future orientation, youth ATOD use and violence. In the proposed projects, I seek to identify place-based assets and resources that are associated with preventing the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence and promote the development of future orientation. In collaboration with school/community partners, I will use these findings to develop an intervention focused on promoting health youth development and reducing ATOD use and violent behavior during year 4, and I will submit an R21 to test this intervention during year 5.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug use and violent behavior can place youth at risk for not completing the developmental tasks of adolescence and limits their transition into healthy productive adults. NIDA and others have recognized the importance of primary prevention strategies to prevent adolescent drug use. The proposed research investigates the relationship between neighborhood and individual-level risk and protective factors and the co- occurrence of ATOD use and violent behavior.

"Testing a Latino web-based parent-adolescent sexual communication intervention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latino adolescents, especially those living in Puerto Rico, are at high risk for HIV/AIDS, other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unintended pregnancies. A web-based parent communication intervention provides an opportunity to benefit adolescents by providing additional support for safer sex decisions, and to increase parents' involvement in sexual health by decreasing barriers that keep them from participating in these interventions. The purpose of this proposed study is to evaluate a brief, theoretically informed, culturally appropriate, and linguistically tailored web-based parental communication program, Cu¿dalos (""Take care of them""), designed to improve parent-adolescent sexual communication and reduce adolescent sexual risk behavior. Recent findings from an R21 RCT testing a brief computer-based version of the Cu¿dalos program indicated that the program increased parent-adolescent general communication and sexual risk communication with English and Spanish speaking U.S. Latinos.7 In this proposed study, we plan to modify the Cu¿dalos intervention by changing to a web-based format, increasing the amount of content related to sexual communication and adding a module on HIV/AIDS stigma. In this RCT, we will recruit parents (n=680) and one of their adolescents (n=680) from community-based agencies in Puerto Rico, and will be randomly assigned to receive either the parent-based Cu¿dalos intervention or a web-based health promotion control condition. Parents and adolescents will complete measures at pre-intervention and at 3-(parents only), 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. We will address the five following specific aims: 1) Does the Cu¿dalos intervention increase parents' comfort with, as well as the amount of, communication with adolescents and decrease stigma at 3-,6-, and 12- month follow-ups as compared to the general health promotion control intervention; 2) Does the Cu¿dalos intervention decrease self-reported adolescent intercourse and unprotected intercourse at the follow-ups as compared to the general health promotion control intervention; 3) Do theory-based variables (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, intentions) mediate the intervention effects of Cu¿dalos on parents' communication with their adolescents; 4) Are the effects of the Cu¿dalos intervention on adolescent sexual behavior and parent-adolescent communication moderated by individual (adolescents: sexual experience, gender, age, stigma; parents: gender, age computer access/experience, frequency and time engaged in the program), and microsystem (adolescents: parent-adolescent communication) variables; and 5) Puerto Rican and Latino youth, the lack of culturally and linguistically effectiv interventions for Latino parents and adolescents, and the absence of web-based interventions for Latinos. If the program is efficacious, the web-based format will accelerate the translation of this program into public health practice and will be an important contribution in supporting safe adolescent sexual health behaviors. Is the intervention cost-effective? This study addresses existing disparities in sexual health outcomes among         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this study will provide an important resource to parents and adolescents to support adolescents' safer sex decisions. Results from testing and using a web-based format will provide important information for the development of future parent-adolescent sexual risk reduction programs and health related technology based interventions for this and other underserved populations.            ",Testing a Latino web-based parent-adolescent sexual communication intervention,8670571,R01NR013505,"['Age ', ' Attitude ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Programs ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Programmed Learning ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Test Result ', ' experience ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' microsystems ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' safer sex ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,411598,0.10281144923524847
"Assessing an adherence intervention for adolescents with kidney transplants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Dr. Amaral is a pediatric nephrologist at Emory-University, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (Emory-CHOA), where she has initiated an adolescent transition clinic. She has a Masters in Health Science from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Her broad long, term career goals are to 1)become a pioneer in the development of evidence- based transitional care strategies for adolescents with chronic illness and 2)to assess and develop practices to eliminate health disparities in transplantation. Her proposed project is directed toward the first of these goals. Research: In this project, Dr. Amaral proposes to address the important problem of poor allograft survival in adolescent kidney transplant recipients due to nonadherence. Her first aim is to conduct a single center phase II randomized controlled trial that will test the effectiveness of a peer mentoring program to improve medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) versus usual care in adolescents with kidney transplants. She will measure HRQOL by written survey and medication adherence by the Brief Medication Questionnaire and pharmacy refill data. Her second aim is to determine the mechanisms by which peer mentoring impacts medication adherence and HRQOL. Specifically, she hypothesizes that peer mentoring provides social support which increases patient self-efficacy and leads to positive health outcomes. Her proposed peer-mentoring program will be telephone-based, with e-communication as deemed mutually agreeable to mentors and mentees. This approach is novel and practical, meeting patients in their ""real world."" Environment: The Emory-CHOA Pediatric Transplant Center is one of the busiest in the country, providing a rich population of patients for Dr. Amaral's single center proposal. Dr. Amaral has formed a solid team of mentors from the Dept. of Pediatrics (Dr. Larry Greenbaum), Dept. of Transplant Surgery (Dr. Allan Kirk) and School of Public Health (Dr. Arriola and Prof. Easley) to facilitate her success. Dr. Arriola has research experience with peer mentoring, having developed a program of patient navigators for African American women with breast cancer. The Rollins School of Public Health offers several relevant courses to Dr. Amaral's career development. The Department of Pediatrics is committed to the success of young investigators, providing support for statistical analysis, grantsmanship and manuscript preparation as well as opportunities to engage with the research community through the Pediatric Research Center. This project's aims are directed at improving the health of adolescents with solid organ transplants by improving medication adherence and consequently long-term allograft function. Patients who maintain functioning transplants have better quality of life and live longer than those who have failed grafts and return to dialysis. This project's aims are well matched to the NIH's mission to supportive investigative efforts to improve health and save lives.     Adolescents with chronic disease are at increased risk for nonadherence as they become young adults. This study will compare adherence and health related quality of life outcomes in two groups of adolescents with kidney transplants: those who receive peer mentoring vs. those who do not, using a primarily telephone-based approach with e-communication tailored to the mentee's interests and resources. Scientific knowledge gained from this study can be used to inform other adolescent chronic disease programs and to prevent allograft loss in adolescents with kidney transplants.

"Early Adversity Shapes Adolescent Risk Behavior Trajectories in Mexican Americans  Early Adversity Shapes Adolescent Risk Behavior Trajectories in Mexican Americans Abstract Over half a million people in the United States have died of AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic, and the number of people living with HIV infection is higher now than ever before. Currently, over 1 million adults and adolescents in the US are living with HIV. The majority of new HIV cases occur before age 25, and young Latinos are disproportionately affected. Compared to non-Latino white youths, Latino adolescents have 4 times the risk of HIV infection and, by young adulthood, more than 4 times the rate of AIDS diagnosis. Latinos are more likely to use substances in early adolescence and more likely to engage in unprotected sex than other ethnic groups, which increases their risk for HIV/AIDS. These disparities are persistent and represent a critical public health issue given the growing population of young Latinos in the US. Mexican Americans represent the largest subgroup of Latinos, yet longitudinal studies with Mexican American youth have been sparse due to a host of methodological barriers. The proposed longitudinal research resolves these issues to address important scientific gaps. By building on a rich, well-established, long-term cohort of Mexican American children and their parents, this project aims to understand whether and how adversity exposure in early life contributes to the emergence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence. Towards this aim, we will gather detailed information on substance use and sexual risk-taking at ages 14y and 15.5y, when adolescents are sustaining the major social and biological transitions of the pubertal period. The strong study design builds on: (1) rich adversity data already collected during pregnancy and throughout childhood for this established cohort of Mexican American youth and their parents, combined with new equally rich data collection proposed in adolescence; (2) impressive participant retention to date in this hard-to-reach population; (3) ongoing assessing of puberty using leading-edge clinic-based methods obtained at multiple points in time; (4) the inclusion of new measures of stress responsivity and pubertal hormones to better understand underlying biophysiological processes; and (5) the inclusion of key protective factors, including parental influences and cultural factors, that may buffer against risk for adolescent problem behaviors. Results from this project will yield important information about the emergence of substance use and sexual risk-taking within this highly vulnerable group. By focusing on potentially modifiable characteristics, this research has the potential to elucidate distinct areas to target for intervention to prevent risk-taking behaviors in adolescence and thereby reduce risk for HIV/AIDS and other STIs over the life course. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is increasing recognition that early life events influence long-term health and health disparities. The design of this study allows us to longitudinally examine the effects of early adversity on the emergence of substance use and risky sexual behaviors among Mexican American adolescents, as well as key factors that may mediate or moderate these effects. This research aims to elucidate targets for intervention to prevent risk- taking behaviors in adolescence and thereby reduce risk for HIV/AIDS and other STIs over the life course.

"ACTION PAC: Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition & Physical Activity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The childhood obesity epidemic has led to the rising prevalence of cardiometabolic risks in adolescents. These risks include abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and pre-diabetes, the clustering of which is known as metabolic (or insulin resistance) syndrome. Longitudinal data show that children and adolescents with metabolic syndrome are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes. This is especially worrisome for youth in New Mexico, a culturally diverse state with 44.9% Hispanics and 9.7% American Indians, because obesity disproportionately affects these populations. School-based health centers (SBHCs) offer an important venue to expand healthcare access for adolescents, who are traditionally hard-to- reach. SBHCs provide health services to all students, with a focus on the uninsured and underserved and may be the only point of intervention for low-income and minority youth. The proposed R01 study will build upon significant findings from a NIH/NHLBI funded R21 study that utilized a community-based participatory research approach to develop and pilot-test a SBHC weight management program called Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition and Physical Activity (ACTION) with two high schools. ACTION was based on the use of motivational interviewing (MI) to support adoption of healthier eating and physical activity behaviors. In this current proposal (ACTION PAC), we propose to collaborate with eight high schools that have SBHCs to evaluate the broader reach and efficacy of using MI-based approaches to prevent and treat overweight/obesity and to decrease the risk of metabolic syndrome development. Specifically, our goals are to 1) prevent the development of overweight and obesity among students with BMI <85th percentile, 2) reduce BMI z score and insulin resistance in students with BMI >=85th percentile, and 3) obtain student and parent feedback on their experience with school-based BMI screening and weight management. To test the efficacy of these MI-based approaches, we will employ a cluster randomized control trial design in which four of the eight high schools will be randomized to an intervention group and the other four high schools will be randomized to a usual care comparison group. 960 participants in the 9th and 10th grades between the ages of 14-17 years will be followed annually for two years (until their 11th and 12th grade, respectively). Analyses will be conducted in a multilevel framework to account for clustering within schools. Baseline and 2nd year comparisons within group and comparison of change between the intervention and comparison groups will be assessed. The collective impact of these research outcomes will advance the field of school-based obesity intervention studies and take a significant step towards identifying sustainable prevention and treatment approaches for adolescent obesity and metabolic syndrome through the use of SBHCs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Healthy People 2020 has set objectives to: 1) increase the proportion of health care providers who regularly assess body mass index (BMI) in their adolescent patients, 2) increase the proportion of health care visits that include counseling related to nutrition, weight and physical activity, 3) reduce the proportion of adolescents who are obese, 4) prevent inappropriate weight gain in youth, 5) improve adolescent diet to include more fruits, vegetable and whole grains and less fats and added sugars, and 6) increase the proportion of adolescents who are physically active. The proposed project, ACTION PAC (Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition and Physical Activity), will address all of the above objectives by evaluating a method to motivate high school students to eat healthier, be physically active and achieve or maintain a healthy weight. Primary health care providers in school-based health centers will assess adolescents' BMI and work with them to adopt healthier behaviors to prevent access weight gain and assist those who are overweight or obese with weight management.",ACTION PAC: Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition & Physical Activity,8719771,R01HL118734,"['whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' Food Intake ',

"Development of an HIV Prevention Game for African American Rural Adolescents     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) in the rural Deep South continue to experience a disproportionate increase in new HIV/AIDS infection despite the availability of HIV prevention interventions with demonstrated effectiveness. In comparison to other areas of the nation, the South has the highest number of adults and adolescents living with and dying from AIDS and the highest percentage of new AIDS cases among people living in rural areas. The number of new cases of HIV/AIDS and other STIs among adolescents is rapidly increasing in the rural Deep South and Alabama. It is important for prevention interventions to target young adolescents prior to their becoming sexually active. However, few interventions are directed toward young adolescents. The search for new intervention strategies appropriate for young adolescents has recently led to the use of electronic games. Electronic gaming interventions hold promise of being developmentally appropriate for young adolescents. However, research involving the use of such strategies in HIV prevention is quite limited. The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a proof of concept prototype for an individually tailored, electronic HIV prevention adventure game for young African American rural adolescents (AARAs), age 12-14 years. We will conduct focus groups with AARAs (n = 80) to better understand the sociocontextual influences on the sexual risk. The gaming intervention will be designed to help AARAs improve decision-making and learn behavioral strategies that assist them with avoiding sexual risk behaviors. Focus groups will be conducted to better understand the sociocontextual influences on HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Based on these findings, a draft of intervention components will be developed and programmed into a gaming prototype with the assistance of programming experts; the acceptability and relevance of the prototype will then be assessed with members of the target population (n=40). Verbatim transcripts of audiotapes of focus group discussions will be the primary data for analysis. Content analysis will be used in analysis and interpretation of the data. The qualitative research software, QSR N-Vivo(R), will be used in coding and sorting data. Descriptive statistical analyses of demographic data will be conducted using SPSS. The study is the first steps in a user-centric approach which involves identifying user needs and using a rapid iterative prototyping process. Findings from this research will serve as the basis for future application for NIH funding (e.g. R34 or R21) to furthe develop and test the electronic gaming intervention. The proposed career development plan is designed to provide additional training in qualitative data analyses, mixed methods research, HIV prevention intervention development, and electronic gaming development. In addition, this award will provide further hands-on research experience under the guidance of an interdisciplinary mentorship panel to meet training goals and enhance the applicant's development as a funded independent investigator and a recognized leader in the field of prevention of HIV and other STDs.          Although many HIV prevention interventions have been developed for AA adolescents, few interventions focus on young AA adolescents. The continuing increasing rates of HIV and STIs in AAs in the Deep South warrants renewed efforts to reduce the disparity in HIV/AIDS by focusing on adolescents before they become engaged in risky sexual behavior. The proposed research will contribute to increasing the understanding of the sociocontextual factors that influence HIV/AIDs risk from the young African American Rural adolescents' perspective, and on using this information to develop a culturally relevant and developmentally appropriate innovative intervention.

"CBPR to Reduce Adolescent Pregnancy and HIV in a DC Public Housing Community     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The District of Columbia is home to both many of the most affluent and most vulnerable communities in the nation. Public housing communities in the city represent the extremes of concentrated disadvantage: racial segregation, poverty, violent crime, high rates of incarceration and dismal health statistics. For more than a decade, the Urban Institute (Ul) has worked closely with the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA), residents of DCHA public housing communities, and similar high-poverty urban communities across the nation to develop and improve outcomes and reduce disparities via improvements to health and social services and structures. As a result of concerns voiced by DCHA residents across multiple housing communities, DCHA approached Ul two years ago to assist them in addressing what they described as ""the problems with our girls."" Based on DCHA and resident recommendations, Ul reached out to resident leaders from Benning Terrace, a high-poverty, African American public housing community which has the highest crime rate and is the most underserved, located in the Districts' Ward 7. A preliminary needs assessment jointly conducted by Ul, DCHA and public housing residents identified a group of related adolescent sexual health concerns - sexual violence and coercion, teen pregnancy and HIV/STI. The current application includes the strengthening of this ongoing collaboration of the DCHA, African American residents (adults and adolescents) of Benning Terrace, community-based health, social service and faith-based organizations, Ul and university-based health disparities researchers to reduce adolescent sexual health disparities. Sexual assault and coercion, pregnancy, and HIV/STI are all significantly over-represented among African Americans in DC; HIV rates are the highest in the nation, with up to 12% of women infected. The proposed three-year CBPR process includes 1) a community-driven needs assessment; 2) an asset mapping process regarding resources and expertise available for inclusion in a sustainable intervention; 3) development of program and evaluation models; and 4) piloting to assess program feasibility, acceptability, perceived efficacy and outcomes.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): Adverse sexual health outcomes (i.e., sexual coercion, pregnancy, and HIV/STIs) are significantly over-represented by African American adolescents, and reach their highest levels in high-poverty neighborhoods. In public housing communities, the use of CBPR to develop interventions targeting adolescents and their parents is a unique approach toward reducing adolescent sexual health disparities.

"Community Violence and Reproductive Health among Youth in Salinas, California  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this study, led by an early-stage investigator building directly on her NICHD K01 research, is to address gaps in research on structural and interpersonal factors in a rural, agricultural community that influence the onset of youth violence and sexual health risks associated with teen pregnancy during the transition from early to middle adolescence. In California, where one in eight U.S. adolescents reside, Latinas maintain the highest teen birth rate, accounting, in 2010, for 41% of the teen population yet 73% of teen births. Adolescent sexual health research has focused primarily on urban youth; however, one in three California teen births are to Latina teens residing in a rural county. Numerous structural and interpersonal (family, peer, partner) factors that shape the risk environment differ between urban and rural communities. Understanding these underlying contexts that contribute to health disparities is vital to achieving substantive improvements in health outcomes. Our NIH-funded research with Latino adolescents in San Francisco over the past 12 years has highlighted a strong connection between community violence and unintended teen pregnancy. Though traditionally regarded as urban, gangs have emerged in many nonurban areas of the United States. This study will take place in Salinas, CA, an agricultural community located in Monterey County on California's central coast. The U.S. Department of Justice named Salinas as one of six high-risk communities nationally for youth gang violence. Monterey County had the sixth highest teen birth rate in 2010 among California's 58 counties. High rates of youth violence and early childbearing in Salinas, California, coupled with entrenched socioeconomic disparities resulting from generations of Mexican migration for agricultural-sector employment, make research to develop appropriate interventions imperative. This context presents an opportunity to examine the relative salience of structural and interpersonal factors to youth violence and reproductive health in a rural county like numerous others throughout central California. This research was initiated by the Monterey County Health Department and has been developed in partnership with an experienced team of NIH investigators. Informed by the Social Ecological Model of Health, we will accomplish our aims through a mixed-methods design that includes formative qualitative research using focus groups, followed by a 2-year prospective cohort study with a random sample of 600 8th grade students, 40 of whom will be selected to complete prospective in-depth interviews. Our aims are to 1) investigate structural and interpersonal factors that are individually and jointly associated with engagement in violent behaviors and sexual health risks among female and male 8th-grade Latino students in Salinas, CA; 2) examine the trajectories of violent behaviors and sexual risk over time, and their interaction, during the transition from 8th grade to 10th grade; and 3) identify structural and interpersonal factors that influence engagement in violent behaviors and sexual health risks during the transition from 8th grade to 10th grade.

"Does chronotype modify the relationship between sleep and BMI in adolescents?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reversing and/or preventing obesity during adolescence yields significant cardio-metabolic rewards. Yet, 90% of obese adolescents become obese adults. This highlights the difficulty in reversing obesity once onset occurs. Additionally, progress in preventing childhood obesity has been slow. Despite promising trends, the widening gulf between minorities and lower socio-economic youth and their non-minority, more affluent counterparts threatens our ability to reduce health disparities in the future. Targeting adolescents for obesity prevention holds great promise for stemming high obesity rates. Theoretical, experimental, and epidemiological support for an association between sleep and obesity exists. However, not all short sleepers are overweight/obese and vice versa and extant studies report inconsistent findings.  This observational study in a lower socio-economic racially diverse school district in NJ seeks to explore whether chronotype modifies the association between short sleep and obesity in adolescents. This study will be one of the first to explore this association. It will involve collaborative efforts with school nurses, physicians, heath teachers, school district administrators, the parent teacher association, and the community at large, thus exemplifying a strong community partnership. It exemplifies how future nurse scientists may lead the way in providing evidence for bio-behavioral approaches to preventing/reversing obesity in adolescents. This proposal is consistent with the applicant's long-term goal to explore chronobiological factors impacting adolescent obesity and sleep and to establish a program of interdisciplinary research aimed at preventing/reducing childhood obesity and current/future health disparities.  Findings from this study will influence policy and clinical practice. Sensitivity of adolescent circadian rhythms to evening light exposure increases the propensity for later chronotypes. Therefore, urban planning and development policies should seek to limit the exposure to light at night by adolescents. Street lighting, field lighting, and community signage should be limited and/or designed to emit lux below a specified threshold in specified areas. School and community athletic policies limiting high school games/practices during late evening hours in lit athletic fields/gymnasiums will also be warranted. Parent/student education coupled with effective strategies for limiting nighttime exposure from light emitting technology will also be important. Screening for late chronotype throughout adolescence will identify those at greatest risk for deleterious metabolic effects. Interventions such as parentally enforced bedtimes, morning light exposure, and support for later high school start times will help maintain circadian alignment limiting deleterious health effects, such as increased BMI, in adolescents with late chronotypes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Preventing obesity onset in adolescents holds the key to reducing the burden of obesity. Whether greater risk for the metabolically deleterious effects of short sleep is associated with chronotypes is unexplored. This study will be one of the first to explore this association in adolescents            ",Does chronotype modify the relationship between sleep and BMI in

"PS11-003 Minority AIDS Research Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed study aims to address health disparities between Hispanic and non-Hispanic whites, particularly as it relates to HIV and drug use in Hispanic adolescents. This goal will be accomplished by two aims: AIM I is to develop an Internet-based version of the face-to-face Familias Unidas intervention (hereafter referred to as Internet-Based Familias Unidas); and AIM II is to evaluate the efficacy of Internet-Based Familias Unidas, relative to both face-to-face Familias Unidas and a community practice control condition, in preventing unprotected sexual behavior and drug use in a community sample of Hispanic adolescents living in Miami-Dade County. 270 Hispanic adolescents recruited from three high schools will be randomized using an urn design to one of three conditions: Internet-Based Familias Unidas, face-to-face Familias Unidas or Community Practice. Face-to-face Familias Unidas, a Hispanic-specific, family- centered intervention, has been found efficacious, relative to control conditions, in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior and drug use in two randomized clinical trials (Pantin et al., 2009; Prado et al., 2007).  Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Internet-Based Familias Unidas and face-to-face Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than Community Practice Control in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior over time; (H2) Internet-Based Familias Unidas and face-to-face Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than Community Practice Control in preventing adolescent drug use over time; (H3) Internet-Based Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than face-to-face Familias Unidas in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior over time; and (H4) Internet-Based Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than face-to-face Familias Unidas in preventing adolescent drug use over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Internet-Based Familias Unidas and face-to-face Familias Unidas on adolescent unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H2a) the effect of Internet-Based Familias Unidas and face-to- face Familias Unidas on adolescent drug use will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H3a) the effect of Internet-Based Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by participation rates; and (H4a) the effect of Internet-Based Familias Unidas on adolescent drug use will be partially mediated by participation rates.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the proposed study is to prevent and reduce HIV risk behaviors among Hispanic adolescents. The knowledge expected to be gained from this study will aid in the development of efficacious Internet-based preventive interventions to reduce HIV, unprotected sexual behavior, and drug use in Hispanic adolescents.         ",PS11-003 Minority AIDS Research Initiative,8597297,U01PS003316,[''],NCHHSTP,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2014,296527,-0.004140065470179876
"Treatment for Latino/a Adolescents with Suicidal Behavior     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching career goal of Yovanska Duarte-Velez, Assistant Research Scientist, at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras Campus (UPR-RP), is to become an independent mental health researcher in clinical interventions for suicidal adolescents and their families, with a specialization in Latino populations. One of her future objectives is to conduct multisite clinical trials of innovative treatments in Puerto Rico ad the United States. Her specific career goals are: 1) develop research skills to conduct randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in real world settings with high risk adolescents; 2) develop research skills to conduct cross-cultural and health disparity research in multisite studies; 3) gain knowledge of procedures to assess observable family variables and neurobehavioral and neurocognitive markers that may prove to be underlying mechanisms of change in treatment outcomes for suicidal adolescents and incorporate these measures in treatment research; and 4) improve knowledge of and gain experience with statistical analyses used in treatment research. These goals will be achieved through: 1) Drs. Spirito (RCT with suicidal adolescents) and Bernal's (Latino mental health) mentorship; 2) consultations with Drs. Canino (multisite & cross-cultural research), Alegria (health disparities & cross-cultural research), Goldston (intervention development), Stout (statistical methods) and Dickstein (neurobehavioral and neurocognitive mechanisms); 3) courses, seminars, workshops, and special training; and 4) execution of the proposed research project. The proposed award will be carried out at Brown University for the first two years and at UPR-RP for the last three years. The primary aim of the proposed research is to evaluate the feasibility of a socio-cognitive-behavioral therapy protocol for suicidal behavior (SCBT-SB protocol) with Latino/a adolescents. The Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) treatment protocol will include developmental and cultural factors in order to optimize treatment outcomes in suicidal Latino/a adolescents. Specifics aims are: 1) refine the treatment protocol to expand its applicability to Latino population in U.S. based on feedback from therapists working with Latino and suicidal adolescents in RI and on a small open trial; 2) develop and implement a training program for the protocol; and 3) conduct a pilot RCT of the SCBT-SB versus treatment as usual (TAU). This proposed project's public health significance is evident, as it addresses two Healthy People 2020 Objectives: MHMD HP2020-1: ""Reduce the suicide rate"" and MHMD HP-2: ""Reduce the rate of suicide attempts by adolescents."" Its clinical significance lies in the fact that there is little evidence of treatment efficacy for suicidal adolescents and there are evident disparities in the delivery of quality clinical services for Latio populations. Its scientific significance is that it tests the feasibility of a novel treatment apprach that aims to incorporate new perspectives relevant to Latino families and minority youth. It also addresses the third strategic objective of the NIMH, which is to: ""Develop new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illness.""         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Culturally sensitive treatment for suicidal minority youth and clinical investigators devoted to high suicide risk and underserved population are nearly absent. The proposed training grant allows Dr. Duarte-Velez to gain expertise in treatment development according to the needs and challenges faced by suicidal minority youths (e.g. ethnic, sexual) and their families.

"Location Initiated Individualized Texts for African American Adolescent Health     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity in the U.S. has disproportionately affected African American (AA) adolescents who have almost twice the prevalence of obesity than their Caucasian peers. This is due in part to greater exposure to, and higher consumption of, 'fast' and calorie dense foods among minority vs. majority populations. Finding effective ways to address dietary habits among AA adolescents is vital to avert the myriad illnesses related to obesity and the associated costs that are likely to cloud their future. Youth consume a significant proportion of their calories during school hours, often from two sources: 1) school meals and 2) fast food restaurants /convenience stores. For AA adolescents, school- related food choices are uniquely impacted by economic and environmental factors. Specifically, many are recipients of free/reduced meals, thus packing a lunch is less realistic. Furthermore, AA adolescents live and attend school in low-income communities with a disproportionally high number of fast food venues and convenience shops. Finding ways to help AA adolescents make healthy choices in these obesogenic environments is essential to reduce the disparity with their age peers. Based on our clinical and research experience we believe that an intervention incorporating location-based tailored texts has great potential to impact dietary choices. Our clinical work in the Michigan Pediatric Outpatient Weight Evaluation and Reduction (MPOWER) program suggests that adolescents' success with making healthy choices is greatly impacted by their school environment. Our preliminary research with the MPOWERed Messages weight-loss intervention indicated that adolescents welcomed health-related texts if they viewed them as personally relevant. Further, they believed the texts helped them make healthy choices but suggested it would be better if they were sent at times when they faced dietary choices. The goal of the proposed study is to develop and pilot test the Location Initiated Individualized Texts for African American Adolescent Health (LIITA3H) mobile application to aid healthy food choices. The study has 3 Aims: 1) Develop a mobile application that will a) accurately identify when students are in their school cafeteria or other eating venue with the intent to eat, b) automatically send a tailored text to prompt healthy choices, and c) convey an annotated photo response about their choice; 2) Develop a message library (adapted from our messages tested previously) tailored to students' food preferences, school /restaurant menus, and incorporate cultural tailoring with input from the target population; 3) Conduct a 1-month pilot, to test the acceptability, feasibilit and use of the intervention via data collected automatically by the app along with semi-structured interviews with adolescents in the pilot and with school personnel to explore whether use of the app influenced school functioning.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will combine our clinical and research experience of text messaging, weight management, and cultural tailoring, in a personalized geo-location and mobile application to create an intervention to help African American adolescents make healthy dietary choices.                 ",Location Initiated Individualized Texts for African American Adolescent Health,8723627,R41MD008840,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Food ', ' Food Preferences ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Libraries ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Motivation ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Research ', ' Restaurants ', ' Schools ', ' Self Determination ', ' Social Marketing ', ' Students ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Diet Habits ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Exposure to ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' calorie (nutrition) ', ' Calories ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' ']",NIMHD,"MEI RESEARCH, LTD",R41,2014,146819,-0.019138852032949058
"Disparities in Health and Academics of Sexual Minorities in Urban Middle Schools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide among lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning (LGBQ) adolescents is a public health concern (Haas, et al., 2010). Recent research demonstrates that anti-LGB prejudice at school and among peers contributes to health risks for LGBQ teens (Russell, Kosciw, Horn, Saewyc, 2010).This project focuses on the experiences of urban, ethnically diverse LGBQ middle school adolescents - a vulnerable yet understudied population - and seeks to identify factors that contribute to risk and resilience for well-being an academic achievement in this group. The first study uses the BIAS MAP (Cuddy, Fiske & Glick, 2007) and draws on the developmental friendship literature (Hallinan & Williams, 1989) to systematically assess intergroup attitudes, peer relations, and school climate and test their impact on psychological and academic outcomes for both LGBQ and heterosexual students. Survey data will be collected from 800 Asian, Black, Latino and White boys and girls enrolled in 7th and 8th grades at several large urban schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). Participants will complete measures assessing their stereotypes, prejudices and behavioral tendencies toward various ethnic LGBQ individuals, their same - and cross-ethnic and cross-sexual orientation friendships, perceived vulnerability at school, and school ethnic diversity as well as students' psychosocial well-being and academic achievement. It is expected that positive intergroup attitudes and school climate, better cross ethnic/sexual orientation friendships and greater ethnic diversity will contribute to enhanced well- being and academic achievement of both LGBQ and heterosexual adolescents of various ethnic groups. The second study employs a well-established experimental paradigm to test whether observing LGB-based victimization impacts the well-being of heterosexual adolescents. Heterosexual Latino boys (n= 120) and Latina girls (n = 120) enrolled in 7th and 8th grades will take part in a virtual ball-tossing computer game called Cyberball (Williams, Cheung, & Choi, 2000) during which they witness a Latino/a lesbian, gay or bisexual student excluded or included in the game. Each participant will complete measures of psychological well-being (i.e., state self-esteem), stereotypes, prejudices and behavioral tendencies toward Latino lesbian, gay and bisexual students; friendships (e.g., number of LGB friends), and the degree to which the participant perceives sexual minority Latinos as in-group. It is expected that witnessing the exclusion of LGB youth perceived to be an in-group member will negatively affect the well-being of the heterosexual observer. A combination of cluster analysis, hierarchical linear modeling and SEM multiple group analysis will be used to test the hypotheses in both studies. Knowledge gained from this program of research can inform prevention and intervention programs suited for implementation in our nation's urban schools.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Suicide among lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning (LGBQ) adolescents is a public health concern and research traces the health risks for LGBQ teens to hostile environments. This project focuses on the experiences of urban, ethnically diverse LGBQ middle school adolescents and identifies factors that contribute to risk and resilience for their well-being and academic achievement. This project will also examines the consequences of witnessing anti-LGB victimization for heterosexual students and provide important empirical evidence to inform educational and social policy designed to ensure that all adolescents regardless of sexual orientation and ethnicity reach their full potential.            ",Disparities in Health and Academics of Sexual Minorities in Urban Middle Schools,8780394,F32HD075531,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Buffers ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Computers ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Health ', ' Horns ', ' Hostility ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Prejudice ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' self esteem ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Policies ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Students ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Social Impacts ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Friendships ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' racism ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Ensure ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Shapes ', ' Rivers ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' bully ', ' bullying ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Exclusion ', ' 7th grade ', ' seventh grade ', ' 8th grade ', ' eighth grade ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Social status ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' junior high school ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Data ', ' Psychological Impact ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' public health relevance ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia  ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F32,2014,53282,0.07790413346204494
"Multilevel Protective Factors For LGB Youth In North America  Abstract  A growing body of literature demonstrates dramatic disparities in health between lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) and heterosexual youth, including problem substance use, HIV risk behaviors and suicide. In 2011 the Institute of Medicine called for additional research with this population, prioritizing health disparities research as ""essential for building a solid evidence base"" in LGB heath. The IOM report highlights the importance of multilevel social influences on the lives of LGB people, specifying the role of social structures such as families, schools, workplaces, religious institutions and community organizations as critical subjects of study to expand our understanding of the determinants of health in this population.  The proposed R01 led by a new investigator in response to PA-12-111, directly addresses this need. The goal of this study is to broaden and deepen our understanding of the family, peer, school and community environments that protect young LGB people from involvement in high risk health behaviors, including substance use, HIV risk behaviors and suicide behaviors. This research aims to 1) develop a theoretically grounded approach to promoting health among LGB adolescents based on in-depth knowledge of their community and school environments, and 2) link environmental data, collected using the Inventory, with existing population-based student data to identify factors at the individual, family, peer, school and community levels that protect LGB youth from involvement in health risk behaviors. ""Go-along"" interviews with 72 youth in diverse locations will be used to elicit in-depth information on LGB adolescents' perceptions of supportive elements in their schools and communities; this information, in conjunction with published literature, expert review, and psychometric testing, will be used to create an LGB Environment Inventory to characterize policies, programs, resources and other supports for LGB youth that exist in these settings. The Inventory will then be used to measure indicators of support in 120 communities in Minnesota, British Columbia and Massachusetts, using publicly available materials (e.g. websites) and brief contacts with key informants (Aim 1). These community-level data will then be linked with existing student survey data from approximately 3,600 LGB adolescents in these same communities, which will include information about family, peer and individual supports, as well as health behaviors and demographic information (Aim 2). The following hypotheses will be tested: a) higher LGB environment scores for the community and school will be protective against health risk behaviors among LGB youth; b) greater family connectedness and support and a more supportive peer environment will be protective against health risk behaviors among LGB youth, and c) family, peer and individual-level factors will moderate the associations between the LGB environment (community and school) and the health risk behaviors of interest. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application for a mixed methods study using a social ecological approach is directly responsive to the 2011 IOM report and the NIH's call for research to advance the health of LGB populations. Findings from this innovative work will indicate specific features of the LGB environment which are protective against health risk behaviors and poor outcomes, and specific subgroups of LGB young people to be targeted for maximum impact. Interventions will build on these insights to increase supports for LGB youth in their families, among their peers, at their schools and in their communities, ultimately extending their protective benefits across the LGB youth population and reducing health disparities.            ",Multilevel Protective Factors For LGB Youth In North America,8613636,R01HD078470,"['Age ', ' Attention ', ' British Columbia ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' In element ', ' Indium ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Literature ', ' Mails ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' North America ', ' Perception ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Students ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Family member ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Review Literature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Study Subject ', ' episodic drinking ', ' binge alcohol consumption ', ' binge drinking ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' informant ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2014,491393,0.01981801809514705
"Mexican-origin Teen Moms, Their Infants, and Mother Figures: Health & Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will examine how developmental, family, cultural, and economic factors interact to inform the health and development of two groups of children who are disproportionately at risk for negative health outcomes:  Mexican-origin adolescent mothers and their young children. Adolescent females of Mexican origin have the highest national birthrate, and it is over twice the overall national rate (National Vital Statistics Report, 2005).  Because children of adolescent mothers are at increased risk for negative outcomes (Chandra, Schivello, Ravi, Weinstein, & Hook, 2002) and adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning has been identified as a predictor of children's health and development (Carothers, Borkowski, Lefever, & Whitman, 2005), it is critical to examine the factors that inform adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning, their parenting behaviors, and in turn, their children's health and development. We propose to build on our study of Mexican-origin adolescent mothers, their mothers or mother figures (referred to in our study as the female family member; FFM), and their infants, which involved data gathered from adolescents and FFMs during the adolescents' third trimester of pregnancy (Wave 1), and from adolescent mothers, FFMs, and infants when infants were 10 months of age (Wave 2) and again when infants were 24 months of age (Wave 3). We propose to collect three additional points of measurement from all three family members in the 206 families who participated in the original project (N = 618).  This longitudinal, multi-generational study will capture cultural, family, and developmental processes and outcomes for a) adolescent mothers and FFMs over a five-year period beginning when adolescent mothers are in middle/late adolescence (i.e., 15-18 years of age) through emerging adulthood (20-23 years of age), and b) their young children from infancy (i.e., 10 months) through early childhood (i.e., 5 yrs of age). Specific aims are  to examine (1) the linkages between trajectories of two normative developmental processes (i.e., ethnic identity,  autonomy) and trajectories of Mexican-origin adolescent mothers' psychosocial functioning (e.g., depressive  symptoms) from middle/late adolescence through emerging adulthood, and to identify family, peer, and cultural  characteristics that moderate these associations; (2) how family (i.e., mother-adolescent conflict), economic  (i.e., economic hardship), and cultural (i.e., acculturative stress and discrimination) stressors are linked to  adolescent mothers' trajectories of psychosocial functioning, and to investigate the family, peer, and cultural  characteristics that moderate these associations; and (3) how trajectories of adolescent mothers' psychosocial  functioning predict their parenting behaviors and, in turn, trajectories of their children's health and development;  we also will test family, peer, and cultural characteristics that moderate these associations. A focus on Mexican-  origin children is critical because Latinos (of which Mexican-origin are a majority) are repeatedly identified as an  at-risk population for negative health and behavioral outcomes and, in fact, show substantial risk for  maladjustment in almost all leading health indicators identified by Healthy People 2010 (CDC, 2008).        Latinos show greater risk for maladjustment in almost all of the leading health indicators identified by Healthy  People 2010 (CDC, 2008) and bear a disproportionate burden of disease, injury, death, and disability in the  U.S. (CDC, 2004a). Furthermore, Mexican-origin adolescent females lead the nation in rates of teen pregnancy (with rates over twice the national average; National Vital Statistics Report, 2005). This research will contribute significantly to understanding how to promote positive health and development among Mexican-origin adolescent mothers and their young children, which is in line with the Surgeon General's call to address health disparities among Latinos and other ethnic minorities (U.S. Surgeon General, 2008).

"Pathological Adaptation to Exposure to Community Violence in Minority Male Youth     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the current project is to examine the model of pathologic adaptation to community violence in a sample of African American and Latino male adolescents residing in low socioeconomic urban neighborhoods. The pathologic adaptation model suggests that youth who become desensitized to violence show less emotional distress, but more violent behavior. The intent of the current project is to test the feasibility of the model, as well as understand how protective factors (i.e., support from family, coping strategies) and vulnerability factors (i.e., deviant beliefs, aggression status) may increas or decrease risk for pathologic adaptation. This application proposes to achieve this goal by conducting secondary data analysis with this vulnerable population. The proposed study will be accomplished through three aims. Aim 1 is to examine the model of pathologic adaptation to community violence using multiple indicators of violence (i.e., severity, witnessing, and victimization). Aim 1 will be tested by [latent growth curve modeling]. Aim 2 is to examine coping processes, parental support, and deviant beliefs as moderators of the linear and nonlinear associations of community violence to pathologic adaptation outcomes. [Latent growth curve modeling] will be used to test Aim 2. Aim 3 is to examine moderating effects of participant ethnicity and pre-test aggression status on the associations of community violence to pathologic adaptation outcomes. [Latent growth curve modeling] will also be used to test Aim 3. The proposed research has the potential to narrow the critical research gap in knowledge on the variations in the impact of exposure to community violence among young men of color residing in low-income, urban communities. The knowledge gained from the study can be used to inform the development of effective preventive interventions to preempt or halt the progression of maladaptive outcomes in these youth. Specifically, the longitudinal, prospective examination of the pathologic adaptation model in this sample will help to identify specific periods of vulnerability, critical levels of ecological risk, vulnerability and protective factors, and, consequently, determine when, where and how to intervene. The identification of aspects of exposure to community violence associated with maladaptive outcomes will reveal aspects of youth environments that can be modified as part of community-level efforts to improve adolescent well-being. The identification of vulnerability factors (i.e., pre-test aggression-statu) will help to identify youth who are at heightened risk for desensitization in response to community violence exposure and, thus, should be targeted for intervention. In addition, understanding how individual (i.e., deviant cognitions, coping strategies) and family (i.e., parental support) factors may increase or reduce the risk of maladaptive outcomes in response to exposure to community violence will yield information about malleable processes that can be targeted to maximize intervention efficacy/effectiveness.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been some successful efforts to curtail violence and crime in urban communities, ethnic minority male adolescents who reside in these communities remain vulnerable to very high levels of exposure to community violence and violence-related outcomes. The goal of the proposal is to elucidate the role of community violence exposure in the development of emotional and behavioral problems over time in a particularly vulnerable group, namely low-income, ethnic minority male adolescents. Such information is essential to inform the development of effective preventive interventions to reduce health disparities and the economic and social burden of community violence exposure (e.g., incarceration, homicide) in ethnic minority males.            ",Pathological Adaptation to Exposure to Community Violence in Minority Male Youth,8616770,R03HD072112,"['adolescent boy ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' Age ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Cognition ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Homicide ', ' Interview ', ' male ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' teacher ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' Equation ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' preempt ', ' Participant ', ' gang ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' deviancy ', ' deviant ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' emotional distress ', ' social ', ' antisocial ', ' anti social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' burden to community ', ' community burden ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' desensitization ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' parent grant ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' early adolescence ', ' young man ', ' ']",NICHD,LOYOLA UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R03,2014,66270,0.05967530536488351

"Social Ecology and the Prevention of Suicide and Aggression in African American Y     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This indicated prevention intervention trial employs a randomized controlled design to examine the efficacy of a 15-session, culturally tailored, cognitive-behavioral group prevention intervention for urban, low income African American adolescents. The PI successfully adapted the Coping with Stress Course (Clarke et al., 1995) to be culturally sensitive and appropriate for use with urban, low-income African American adolescents. This culturally-adapted intervention (i.e., the Adapted-Coping with Stress Course [Robinson & Case, 2003]) will be significantly revised to enhance individual competencies believed to mitigate the risk for self-directed (i.e., suicidality) and inter-personal aggression. n addition, the proposed study aims to examine how neighborhood and family ecological characteristics moderate the effects of a culturally-adapted, cognitive-behavioral coping with stress prevention intervention on African American adolescents' self-directed (i.e., suicidality) and interpersonal aggression.  This study is expected to have broad public health implications toward the reduction of African American youth health disparities and inform practice and policy on the development of effective violence prevention interventions for African American youth. It is expected that this study will inform a future large scale effectiveness study that will embed an evidence-based, culturally sensitive violence prevention intervention within a large urban school system.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is transformative and will provide vital knowledge pertaining to the understanding and prevention of African American youth violence, both self-directed and interpersonal.

"Daily Experience in Adolescence and Biomarkers of Early Risk for Adult Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite calls for the identification of early risk factors for the development of chronic health conditions, there has been little longitudinal research on biomarkers of health that has been conducted in persons younger than 25 years of age. In addition, there is only a minimal understanding of how biological indices of early risk for adult health develop among adolescents with Latin American and Asian backgrounds, the two fastest rising ethnic groups in the United States, who are at differential risk for adverse health outcomes as compared to European Americans. An understanding of these processes is necessary for the development of ethnically and culturally relevant prevention efforts.  We propose a 3-wave longitudinal study of adolescents and their caregivers from Mexican, Chinese and European backgrounds in order to assess the impact of daily experience on biological indicators of early risk for adult health. Our focus on daily experience stems from the need to identify the mechanisms by which global social factors identified in demographic surveys, such as lower education and income, play themselves out in individuals' daily lives. Daily experiences such as social conflict, excessive demands, emotional distress, threat, and sleep behaviors have been shown to be linked to both global risk factors and multiple biological indices of health risk among adults.  The project will include both intensive behavioral assessments and detailed biological markers of health risk from both adolescents and their parents in order to address the following specific aims: (1) describe the development during adolescence of biological indices of early risk for adult health; (2) assess the role of daily experience in the development of early health risk; (3) examine the existence of ethnic disparities in early health risk; and (4) explore the role of potential protective factors in the development of early health risk.  Approximately 540 pairs of adolescents and primary caregivers (180 from each ethnic group) will be assessed when the adolescents are approximately 15-16, 17-18, and 19-20 years of age. Each year, both adolescents and caregivers will participate in interviews that include measures of global social factors such as socioeconomic background and potential protective factors such as social connectedness. Participants will report daily experiences using a nightly diary checklist for 9 consecutive days. Salivary cortisol will be obtained at 4 time points each day for 4 of these days in order to analyze HPA activity, and participants will wear wrist actigraphs for the same 4 days to measure objective sleep behaviors. Blood pressure, BMI, and waist/hip ratio will be assessed, and dried blood spots will be obtained for the assessment of c-reactive-protein (CRP), cholesterol, and high density lipoproteins (HDL). Finally, peripheral blood samples will be provided by a subsample of 120 families for the assessment of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and for gene expression analyses of molecular signaling pathways driving inflammatory biology.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is only a minimal understanding of how biological indices of early risk for adult health develop among adolescents with Latin American and Asian backgrounds, the two fastest rising ethnic groups in the United States, who are at differential risk for adverse health outcomes as compared to European American. More in-depth examinations of the daily lives of adolescents from these populations could identify both the sources of these disparities as well as unique risk and protective factors. An understanding of these processes is necessary for the development of ethnically and culturally relevant prevention efforts.

"Early Life Determinants of Accelerated Pubertal Development in Adolescent Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Kubo's long-term career goal is to understand early-life determinants of cancer risk factors that relate to obesity and metabolic dysregulation, and to identify high-risk sub-populations that can benefit from early intervention strategies. Her primary research aim is to examine whether factors such as intrauterine exposure to maternal gestational diabetes (GDM), excessive gestational weight gain, obesity, and rapid infant weight gain increase the risk of accelerated pubertal onset in adolescent girls, an important breast and reproductive cancer risk factor. Her secondary aim is to explore the causes of the observed racial/ethnic differences in timing of puberty. No previous studies have examined these associations. These research goals will take advantage of electronic health data that are available in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated health plan that covers about 450,000 girls. Two specific approaches are proposed: 1. Linkage of mothers' and daughters' electronic health data in an on-going prospective study of predictors of sexual maturation in adolescent girls (U01 ES/CA019435) (Study 1); and, 2. Establishment of a new cohort of 20,000 multiethnic mother-daughter pairs using the electronic databases within KPNC (Study 2). Study 1 will utilize data from the CYGNET study (PI: Lawrence H. Kushi, ScD), which has been following 444 girls annually since 2005 with extensive information on pubertal development and anthropometric measures. The KPNC GDM and Pregnancy Glucose Tolerance Registry (Director: Assiamira Ferrara, MD, PhD) will be linked to the CYGNET data to accomplish study 1. In addition, the Registry will be used to establish a new cohort of mother-daughter pairs. This will allow Dr. Kubo gain experience and skills in establishing and follow a cohort based on KPNC electronic medical record data, and to explore racial/ethnic differences in pubertal onset. Electronic documentation of Tanner stage (an established five-stage classification scheme to assess pubertal development) from routine pediatric visits has recently been implemented at KPNC, and this availability on a large and diverse pediatric population makes this study unique and innovative. The candidate's research goals will be complemented with formal, mentored training through coursework and tailored tutorials in pediatric endocrinology, intergenerational transmission of metabolic dysregulation, advanced biostatistics, cancer prevention and health disparities, and responsible conduct of research. KPNC's Division of Research is an ideal environment for the proposed training because it provides unique and extensive electronic databases, access to data from a large, multiethnic membership, and internationally-recognized multidisciplinary experts. The planned scientific training and mentorship will build on the candidate's previous training in nutrition and cancer epidemiology, and uniquely position her to attain her goals. The proposed studies will provide crucial skills in establishing a new cohort, providing a platform for Dr. Kubo to develop successful R01 research to further elucidate early life determinants of pubertal onset and other cancer risk factors.             PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past century, adolescent girls have been maturing significantly earlier in the United States, with substantial racial/ethnic differences. Early-maturing girls are at risk for a variety of negative health outcomes, including increased risk of breast and other reproductive cancers, though aside from obesity, little is known as to what early life factors influence the timing of pubertal development. The proposed research will allow me to better understand early determinants of accelerated pubertal development in girls and to identify high risk populations, which can inform future effective

"Linking Biological and Social Pathways to Adolescent Health and Well-Being     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Linking Biological and Social Pathways to Adolescent Health and Well-Being Abstract Research across disciplines provides strong evidence that exposure to chronic stress contributes to poor physical and mental health outcomes across the life course. Consequently, large-scale population studies have increasingly integrated the collection of biomarkers of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity (e.g. cortisol) to investigate the extent to which the neuroendocrine pathway explicates the role of chronic stress in shaping poor health outcomes and racial/ethnic and socioeconomic health disparities. However, few population studies have collected cortisol biomarkers from adolescents and among those that have, significant methodological challenges ultimately hampered data quality. Therefore, the purpose of this R21 proposal is to field test the collection of non-invasive longitudinal cortisol samples from adolescents to explore the validity and reliability of nightly measures of salivary cortisol for 6 nights and one hair sample for cortisol. The findings will determine if the collection of these measures is feasible and informative in a population of adolescents across a spectrum of social risk for impaired health. This R21 proposal is unique in that we will leverage a subsample of adolescents participating in the first wave of a recently funded prospective cohort study - the Adolescent Health and Development in Context (AHDC) study (PI Browning; NIH 1R01DA032371-01 and the William T. Grant Foundation). The AHDC study will examine the impact of spatial and social exposures on the risk behavior, victimization and mental health outcomes of 4,000 adolescents aged 11-17 years in Franklin County, Ohio. The specific aims of this R21 proposal are: Aim 1: To field test the collection of non-invasive biomarkers of cortisol in adolescents via nightly salivary samples for 6 nights and one hair sample and Aim 2: To examine the relationships between the (a) cortisol biomarkers; (b) immune function biomarkers (EBV DNA) and (c) linked secondary data from the AHDC study of adolescent risk behavior, psychosocial stressors, and environmental stressors. Our analytic strategy will employ advanced multilevel modeling techniques designed to estimate the variability in cortisol levels between and within individuals and the behavioral, psychosocial and environmental stressors associated with this variability. The findings of this R21 proposal will inform the selection of a high-quality, feasible and cost-effective biomarker data collection protocol to determine the biological impact of social risk on adolescent health and behavior in the second wave of the AHDC study. In addition, these data will inform the design of future population research studies to reduce adolescent health risk and disparities, with potential health benefits over the life course.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research will explore a high-quality, feasible and cost-effective protocol for the collection of cortisol biomarkers in population studies examining the biological impact of social risk on adolescent health, health behaviors, and health disparities. Findings from this research may help to elucidate the extent to which the neuroendocrine pathway explicates the role of chronic exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors in shaping poor health outcomes and racial and socioeconomic health disparities.                ",Linking Biological and Social Pathways to Adolescent Health and Well-Being,8699180,R21DA034960,"['abstracting ', ' suprarenal gland ', ' Adrenals ', ' Adrenal Glands ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Community Surveys ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Crime ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' virus DNA ', ' viral DNA ', ' human herpesvirus 4 group ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' Herpesvirus 4 (gamma), Human ', ' HHV-4 ', ' Epstein-Barr Virus ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' EBV ', ' EB virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' Household and Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Mails ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Ohio ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Pituitary Nervous System ', ' Pituitary ', ' Hypophysis Cerebri ', ' Hypophysis ', ' Pituitary Gland ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Saliva ', ' Schools ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Social Network ', ' Social Impacts ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Discipline ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Data Quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' Salivary ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' environmental stressor ', ' stressor ', ' trait ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Population Study ', ' Impaired health ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' Length ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Population Research ', ' Retrieval ', ' Collection ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NIDA,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,154000,0.09859937565446594
"Project LOVE: Preventing Adolescent Dating Violence among Rural African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent dating violence (ADV) continues to be a major public health problem. The need to address and prevent ADV has received notable attention in recent years. Although it has been documented that ADV occurs at an alarming rate among teens from all backgrounds, there are particular disparities among those who are African American and live in rural communities. My NCMHD Disparities Research and Education Advancing Mission (DREAM) Career Transition Award (K22) is entitled: Project LOVE: Preventing Adolescent Dating Violence among Rural African Americans. As the name implies, the focus of the K22 is to gain additional training and research experience necessary to become an independent prevention researcher who can design, conduct and evaluate community-based intervention trials to prevent ADV among rural African Americans. My academic, clinical, teaching, and research experiences to date have prepared me to successfully enter my next phase of career development. I have received excellent preparation in the areas of mental health, ADV, community-based participatory research (CBPR), and qualitative research design and data analysis. This preparation occurred through my doctoral training in Counseling Psychology, Postdoctoral Fellowship in Public Health, W. K. Kellogg Health Scholars Fellowship in Health Disparities and CBPR, and current faculty position at GUMC. As a psychologist, I have had the opportunity to work clinically with a diverse group of clients. I have provided individual, couples, family, and group therapy. In regards to teaching, I have taught and/or co-taught numerous Psychology and Public Health courses. Some of the relevant courses are: adolescent mental health, counseling early adolescents, human development, cross cultural counseling, music therapy, CBPR, and health education. These courses in one way or another all relate to and/or have informed my research program. In addition to strong institutional support, the institutional environment in which I will complete the extramural phase of the K22 award (i.e., Georgetown University, Georgetown University Medical Center, Department of Psychiatry, and The Georgetown Center for Trauma and the Community) coupled with my community partners far exceed those necessary to carry out my proposed career development and research plans. Over the past six years, I have also engaged in multiple research projects aimed at eliminating health disparities. These projects have involved extensive community engagement and collaboration. My current and future research program is designed to use CBPR to decrease health disparities by preventing ADV among African American youth in rural settings. Two critical components of the research are: (a) an examination of social, ecological, and cultural factors that impact ADV, and (b) an examination of the association of ADV with both mental and sexual health. The proposed K22 research plan will build upon my previous research to enable the design and pilot testing of a community-based, culturally-appropriate, effective, and sustainable ADV prevention intervention for rural, African American youth. Thus, my K22 career development goals focus on the development of competence in: Goal 1: research skills focusing on quantitative methods and data analysis and grant writing; Goal 2: racial/ethnic and rural health disparities, which will inform the conceptualization, design and conduct of culturally and geographically appropriate research; Goal 3: the development and implementation of community-based interventions; and Goal 4: the design, conduct, and evaluation of community-based intervention trials. These goals will be accomplished through a comprehensive plan that includes mentoring, expert consultation, community partner collaboration, coursework, instructional programs, tutorials, conference attendance, presentations, publication writing, and teaching. The Project LOVE research plan will build upon previous research by further developing a community-academic partnership that will guide the design and evaluation of an ADV prevention intervention for rural African American adolescents. The following research question guides the study: How can CBPR be used to design and pilot test an ADV prevention intervention appropriate for rural African American adolescents? Our specific aims are: Aim #1: To further develop and evaluate the Project LOVE community-academic partnership and community advisory board. Successful completion of this aim will increase partnership research capacity; Aim #2: To design a culturally and geographically appropriate community-based ADV prevention intervention for rural African American adolescents aged 10-14; Aim #3: To assess the acceptability of the intervention through the use of focus group interviews; and Aim#4: To pilot test the intervention to evaluate the feasibility and of intervention design. My previous and current research, coupled with the proposed K22 career development and research plans will provide the knowledge and skills necessary to successfully design, conduct, and evaluate a community-based intervention trial, thereby marking my transition to independent investigator status.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescent dating violence continues to be a major public health problem. Particular disparities exist among adolescents who are African American and live in rural communities. This application includes a career development and research plan that focuses on reducing health disparities by preventing dating violence among rural African American adolescents.         ",Project LOVE: Preventing Adolescent Dating Violence among Rural African Americans,8650920,K22MD006142,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Couples ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human Development ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Music Therapy ', ' Names ', ' North Carolina ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Rural Health ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' trauma centers ', ' Universities ', ' Wood ', ' Wood material ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' County ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Rural Community ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' prevent violence ', ' violence prevention ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Family Violence ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' mental health counseling ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Phased Career Development ', ' Mentored Clinical Scientists Development Award ', ' Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Career Transition Award ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' K22 Award ', ' Preparation ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Group Therapy ', ' dating violence ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' community based evaluation ', ' Coupled ', ' NCMHD ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' community consultation ', ' prevent dating violence ', ' dating violence prevention ', ' ']",NIMHD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,K22,2014,188929,0.09496741746949468
"Family Aggression and Trajectories of Adolescent Adaptation: Bioregulatory Effect     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aggressive marital conflict and harsh parenting (family aggression) are highly prevalent. Chronic exposure to family aggression elevates adolescents' risk for antisocial and risky behavior, depressed mood, and cognitive decrements - significant public health problems that increase in prevalence and severity during adolescence. Explaining variability in trajectories of adaptation in the context of family aggression - why some adolescent's exhibit resilience and others deteriorate - is a critical need for science and practice. Findings stemming from the proposed study will illuminate autonomic nervous system activity and sleep regulation variables (bioregulatory processes), as well as economic and social context (peer affiliation) variables, which may mediate the risk of family aggression or operate to exacerbate or protect against its effects on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral maladjustment from late childhood through late adolescence. The design builds on a well-characterized 3-wave study; children ranged between 8-11 years across waves. The proposed study will involve 3 additional waves with a 1-year lag: 50% girls, ~14-15 years at T4, with high representation of both African-American and lower SES families. Study constructs are assessed with multiple informants and measures. Sleep parameters are examined objectively, via actigraphy, and subjectively. ANS activity (sympathetic and parasympathetic) is measured with standard indices, and reactivity is assessed with well-established lab procedures. The large and diverse sample, breadth of measurement across important adolescent outcome domains, and a 6-wave longitudinal design will permit analyses of long- term developmental trajectories, interactions among biopsychosocial processes, and profiles of family, bioregulatory and socioecological risk. The proposed study will create new knowledge in areas of great significance through investigations of bioregularoty and socioecological variables that have the potential to enhance understanding of risk among adolescents exposed to family aggression and to identify physiological, behavioral, and ecological targets for intervention. Outcome variables include public health priorities, such as behavioral and emotional adjustment, academic performance (PA-07-046, Research on Mind-Body Interactions and Health), violence (PA-09-169, Research on Teen Dating Violence), and sleep disturbances (PA-07-140, Research on Sleep and Sleep Disorders). Hypotheses will be tested across a wide range of socioecological contexts with a diverse community sample (PA-07-379, Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities). Other key strengths include our focus on estimating trajectories of adolescent functioning across multiple domains; considering the direction of effects between constructs; and comparing the strength of associations at different time points across development.          Aggressive marital conflict and harsh parenting are highly prevalent and elevate adolescents' risk for antisocial and risky behavior, depressed mood, and cognitive decrements- significant public health problems that increase in prevalence and severity during adolescence. However, the potential effects of bioregulatory and socioecological variables on trajectories of adolescent adjustment in the context of family aggression are not well understood. The proposed study will illuminate autonomic nervous system activity, sleep regulation, and socioecological variables that may mediate the risk of family aggression or operate to exacerbate or protect against its effects on adolescent functioning across multiple domains from late childhood through late adolescence, which will help identify behavioral, physiological, and ecological targets for prevention and intervention.

"Culturally-Specific HIV Prevention with Latino Adolescent Alcohol Abusers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 research and training award advances the long-term goal of reducing ethnic/racial health disparities in HIV/AIDS infection. The proposed training and research plans will enable the PI to develop the skills needed for an independent research career in this area of research. The objective of this application is to develop skills in HIV prevention research and the use of Community-Based Participatory Research and qualitative data collection methods to inform the development of an intervention which targets specific risk and protective factors associated with Hispanic adolescents' drinking and sexual risk taking behaviors. Data demonstrate that both sexual risk behaviors and alcohol use are prominent among Hispanic adolescents, and that the co- occurrence of these behaviors are directly associated with HIV/AIDS infection. Despite literature demonstrating the influence that intrapersonal factors, contextual factors, and culturally specific factors play in Hispanic adolescents' drinking and sexual risk taking behaviors, to date, no interventions addressing all three of these factors exists. This application addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a culturally specific HIV prevention intervention addressing risk and protective factors within these three domains to reduce Hispanic adolescents' risk of HIV infection. Specifically, the culturally specific intervention will include: 1) an adolescent Individual Motivational Interview (IMI) to address alcohol- and sex-related expectancies and attitudes, and alcohol refusal and safe sex behavioral intentions and self-efficacy; 2) a parent Motivational Interview to address parental monitoring and supervision and alcohol- and sex-related family communication; and, 3) an additional module designed to address acculturation conflicts between parents and adolescents, to restore the protective factors of familismo and respeto, and increase adolescents' ethnic identity and pride. A three-phase top-down research approach to adapt, refine, and pilot test the preventative intervention will be conducted. Phase I will include focus groups with Hispanic adolescents and parents and initial manual development. Phase II will include therapist training, an open pilot trial, qualitative exit interviews, and further manual revisions. Phase III will inclde a small-randomized clinical trial with 75 families recruited and randomly assigned to a culturally specific HIV prevention intervention, a standard HIV prevention intervention, or an assessment only condition. Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary indication of a reduction in HIV risk behavior and alcohol use will be examined at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. To enable the PI to pursue this long- term research agenda, she will work with experienced mentors to build four areas of expertise: (1) expertise in HIV prevention research; (2) expertise in the use of Community-Based Participatory Research methods; (3) skills for conducting qualitative research; and (4) skills in developing integrated alcohol and sexual risk interventions. This K01 addresses a key priority in HIV prevention science, and it will fully prepare the PI for an independent research career in the field.           The long-term objectives of this application include 1) reducing and eliminating health disparities in HIV infection and alcohol use disorders among ethnic/racial groups, and 2) increasing access to care among ethnic/racial groups through the development of community-based and culturally appropriate interventions. This application also addresses Healthy People 2020's objectives ""to increase the proportion of adolescents who are connected to a parent,"" ""to reduce the proportion of students engaging in binge drinking,"" and ""to reduce new HIV infections among adolescents.""

"Cortisol regulation during exercise and obesity in adolescents with Down syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents with Down syndrome exceeds 50% and is significantly greater than rates observed in the general population. This condition persists into adulthood and contributes to the development of additional secondary health conditions. Thus, obesity represents a predominant source of health disparity. It remains unclear what causes the higher prevalence of obesity among adolescents with Down syndrome. Glucocorticoid (i.e. cortisol) function may be a novel neuroendocrine mechanism to explain the increased risk of obesity in this population. Recent research suggests that young adults with Down syndrome exhibit cortisol dysregulation compared to adults without disabilities. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and cortisol function have been shown to promote weight gain and greater abdominal fat mass in the general population. However, it remains unclear whether differences in cortisol functioning in adolescents with Down syndrome contribute to the greater prevalence of obesity. Furthermore, many interventions to address pediatric obesity involve exercise. Normal cortisol response to exercise is expected to have a protective effect on obesity development, but it is unclear how cortisol response to exercise is associated with obesity in adolescents with Down syndrome. This fellowship application, therefore proposes to study how cortisol function mediates the association between fat mass (obesity) and Down syndrome under two conditions: 1) daily living in the natural environment; and 2) in response to a bout of moderate-intensity exercise. Pediatric obesity is significant public health problem, especially in populations with pediatric disabilities. This research will examine a novel mechanism to explain the greater obesity prevalence among youth with Down syndrome. Through studying this mechanism during daily life and in the context of a modifiable health behavior, this proposed study may promote the development of effective interventions and prevention programs in the future. This F31 Pre-doctoral Fellowship seeks to expand my current doctoral training and research potential. The primary goal will be to gain research skills that will enable me to study neuroendocrine and physiological factors that contribute to health disparities and obesity among youth with Down syndrome. The award will provide: 1) more time to focus on the proposed research project; and 2) additional resources to increase my research training in advanced exercise physiology, metabolic endocrinology and the pathophysiology of obesity. The comprehensive training plan and proposed research project will examine a novel mechanism that could better explain obesity in this ""at-risk"" population.

"HIV and Substance Use Prevention Among Maltreated and Non-Maltreated Female Adolescents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Females diagnosed with HIV have experienced high rates of intimate partner violence, have a history of sexual victimization beginning in childhood, and are significantly more likely to abuse substances (Cavanaugh, Hansen, & Sullivan, 2010; Cohen et al., 2000). However, little is known about how HIV risk behaviors begin and are sustained throughout adolescence among high-risk females who have been abused. In addition, the landscape of sexual socialization is rapidly changing as internet pornography becomes more accessible (Ybarra, Finkelhor, Mitchell, & Wolak, 2009) and social media websites more popular (Rideout, Foehr, Roberts, & Foundation, 2010). Therefore, the current study aims to understand how cyber-sexual socialization is related to HIV risk behavior in conjunction with other risk behaviors (such as substance use) through the person-centered approaches of Latent Class Analysis and Latent Transition Analysis. Using data from the Female Adolescent Development Study (FADS) which followed a high-risk sample (45% African American and 53% maltreated) of female adolescents from age 14-19, the proposed study will (1) identify particular sub-groups of female adolescents at particular risk for substance use and HIV risk behavior before the onset of those behaviors, informing the target population for intervention, (2) identify new risk factors through risky online behavior that are so much a part of adolescents sexual behavior today, informing the relevant content of interventions, (3) identify how clustering of many risk factors related to HIV and substance use transition over time, informing the timing of interventions, and (4) determine how the HIV risk path differs for maltreated adolescents and ethnic minorities so that interventions that target safe sexuality can help all female adolescents navigate safe sexual behavior.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In order to provide the traction necessary to fill in the gaps of knowledge and education to reduce HIV risk and substance use among female adolescents, the proposed study will (1) identify particular sub-groups of female adolescents at particular risk for substance use and HIV risk behavior before the onset of those behaviors, (2) identify new risk factors through risky online behavior that are so much a part of adolescents sexual behavior today, (3) identify how HIV and substance use behaviors transition over time, and (4) determine how the HIV risk path differs for maltreated adolescents and ethnic minorities so that interventions that target sexuality can help all female adolescents navigate safe sexual behavior. By applying new analytic techniques, critical new insight into the dynamic processes involved in HIV risk behavior among female adolescents will be gained.            ",HIV and Substance Use Prevention Among Maltreated and Non-Maltreated Female Adolescents,8907377,F31DA039603,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' Molestation, Sexual, Child ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Persons ', ' Play ', ' Pornography ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Rape ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexuality ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Socialization ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Traction ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Chronic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' European ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' sex abuse ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Safe Sex ', ' condoms ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Population Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Sum ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' violence against women ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' mistreatment ', ' maltreatment ', ' prospective ', ' sexual trauma ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' sexual violence ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' early adolescence ', ' prevent substance use ', ' substance use prevention ', ' ']",NIDA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,F31,2015,27120,-0.009855735683742546
"Changing the Narrative:  Using Media to Shift Social Norms of Violence Among Youth in West Louisville ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth violence is a serious public health issue, particularly in the disproportionate burden upon economically disadvantaged, inner city, and minority populations. Intentional injury is the leading cause of death among persons 10 to 24 years of age in Kentucky, and the second leading cause of death for this age group nationally. Alarmingly, Kentucky's homicide rate for this same age group is 10 times higher for Black males (38.7/100,000) than for White males (3.9/100,000). In Louisville, KY, substantial social and health disparities-including violence and related risk factors-are concentrated in West Louisville (WL), an economically disadvantaged, urban, primarily Black community. Led by the School of Public Health & Information Sciences (SPHIS), researchers at the University of Louisville (UofL) propose to establish the UofL Youth Violence Prevention Center, partnering with researchers from Vanderbilt University. The specific aims of the proposed center include: 1. Strengthen the infrastructure to support youth violence prevention research and practice at the University of Louisville. 2. Develop, implement and evaluate a community-level social norming campaign to change the norms of violence among youth in West Louisville using mass and social media. 3. Document the development and implementation of the social norming campaign to improve replication and scalability in other settings or communities. 4. Evaluate the relationship between community readiness, community capacity, and the implementation of the community-level social norming campaign. 5. Disseminate study findings in meaningful and actionable format to a variety of relevant audiences (i.e., community, local organizations and leaders, youth violence prevention researchers and practitioners, academic peers, and policy-makers). The interdisciplinary research team proposes a quasi-experimental design to examine the effectiveness of using a community-level 3-year social norming campaign utilizing new media to change norms of violence among youth 10-24 and introduce prosocial norms driven by cultural identity, with WL as the intervention community and East Nashville, TN as the control community. The researchers and a team of community collaborators will with a professional advertising agency to plan and design the campaign, which will be deployed in Year 2. Surveys and interviews will capture data measuring our dependent variables of social norms and violent behavior (independent variables: campaign exposure by media type, demographics), and population-level youth violence data from schools, emergency departments, and local police departments will offer measures of change in serious youth violence at the population level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intentional injury is the leading cause of death among youth ages 10 to 24 in Kentucky, and the homicide rate in the state for the same age group is 10 times higher for Black males (38.7/100,000) than for White males (3.9/100,000).

"Multilevel Protective Factors For LGB Youth In North America DESCRIPTION: A growing body of literature demonstrates dramatic disparities in health between lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) and heterosexual youth, including problem substance use, HIV risk behaviors and suicide. In 2011 the Institute of Medicine called for additional research with this population, prioritizing health disparities research as ""essential for building  solid evidence base"" in LGB heath. The IOM report highlights the importance of multilevel social influences on the lives of LGB people, specifying the role of social structures such as families, schools, workplaces, religious institutions and community organizations as critical subjects of study to expand our understanding of the determinants of health in this population.  The proposed R01 led by a new investigator in response to PA-12-111, directly addresses this need. The goal of this study is to broaden and deepen our understanding of the family, peer, school and community environments that protect young LGB people from involvement in high risk health behaviors, including substance use, HIV risk behaviors and suicide behaviors. This research aims to 1) develop a theoretically grounded approach to promoting health among LGB adolescents based on in-depth knowledge of their community and school environments, and 2) link environmental data, collected using the Inventory, with existing population-based student data to identify factors at the individual, family, peer, school and community levels that protect LGB youth from involvement in health risk behaviors. ""Go-along"" interviews with 72 youth in diverse locations will be used to elicit in-depth information on LGB adolescents' perceptions of supportive elements in their schools and communities; this information, in conjunction with published literature, expert review, and psychometric testing, will be used to create an LGB Environment Inventory to characterize policies, programs, resources and other supports for LGB youth that exist in these settings. The Inventory will then be used to measure indicators of support in 120 communities in Minnesota, British Columbia and Massachusetts, using publicly available materials (e.g. websites) and brief contacts with key informants (Aim 1). These community-level data will then be linked with existing student survey data from approximately 3,600 LGB adolescents in these same communities, which will include information about family, peer and individual supports, as well as health behaviors and demographic information (Aim 2). The following hypotheses will be tested: a) higher LGB environment scores for the community and school will be protective against health risk behaviors among LGB youth; b) greater family connectedness and support and a more supportive peer environment will be protective against health risk behaviors among LGB youth, and c) family, peer and individual-level factors will moderate the associations between the LGB environment (community and school) and the health risk behaviors of interest. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application for a mixed methods study using a social ecological approach is directly responsive to the 2011 IOM report and the NIH's call for research to advance the health of LGB populations. Findings from this innovative work will indicate specific features of the LGB environment which are protective against health risk behaviors and poor outcomes, and specific subgroups of LGB young people to be targeted for maximum impact. Interventions will build on these insights to increase supports for LGB youth in their families, among their peers, at their schools and in their communities, ultimately extending their protective benefits across the LGB youth population and reducing health disparities.",Multilevel Protective Factors For LGB Youth In North America,8856617,R01HD078470,"['Age ', ' Attention ', ' British Columbia ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' In element ', ' Indium ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Literature ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' North America ', ' Perception ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Students ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Family member ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Review Literature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Study Subject ', ' episodic drinking ', ' binge alcohol consumption ', ' binge drinking ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' informant ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2015,406242,0.019957808915267536
"Early Adversity Shapes Adolescent Risk Behavior Trajectories in Mexican Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over half a million people in the United States have died of AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic, and the number of people living with HIV infection is higher now than ever before. Currently, over 1 million adults and adolescents in the US are living with HIV. The majority of new HIV cases occur before age 25 and young Latinos are disproportionately affected. Compared to non-Latino white youths, Latino adolescents have 4 times the risk of HIV infection and, by young adulthood, more than 4 times the rate of AIDS diagnosis. Latinos are more likely to use substances in early adolescence and more likely to engage in unprotected sex than other ethnic groups, which increases their risk for HIV/AIDS. These disparities are persistent and represent a critical public health issue given the growing population of young Latinos in the US. Mexican Americans represent the largest subgroup of Latinos, yet longitudinal studies with Mexican American youth have been sparse due to a host of methodological barriers. The proposed longitudinal research resolves these issues to address important scientific gaps. By building on a rich, well-established, long-term cohort of Mexican American children and their parents, this project aims to understand whether and how adversity exposure in early life contributes to the emergence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence. Towards this aim, we will gather detailed information on substance use and sexual risk-taking at ages 14y and 15.5y, when adolescents are sustaining the major social and biological transitions of the pubertal period. The strong study design builds on: (1) rich adversit data already collected during pregnancy and throughout childhood for this established cohort of Mexican American youth and their parents, combined with new equally rich data collection proposed in adolescence; (2) impressive participant retention to date in this hard-to-reach population; (3) ongoing assessing of puberty using leading-edge clinic-based methods obtained at multiple points in time; (4) the inclusion of new measures of stress responsively and pubertal hormones to better understand underlying bio physiological processes; and (5) the inclusion of key protective factors, including parental influences and cultural factors, that may buffer against risk for adolescent problem behaviors. Results from this project will yield important information about the emergence of substance use and sexual risk-taking within this highly vulnerable group. By focusing on potentially modifiable characteristics, this research has the potential to elucidate distinct areas to target for intervention to prevent risk-taking behaviors in adolescence and thereby reduce risk for HIV/AIDS and other STIs over the life course. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is increasing recognition that early life events influence long-term health and health disparities. The design of this study allows us to longitudinally examine the effects of early adversity on the emergence of substance use and risky sexual behaviors among Mexican American adolescents, as well as key factors that may mediate or moderate these effects. This research aims to elucidate targets for intervention to prevent risk- taking behaviors in adolescence and thereby reduce risk for HIV/AIDS and other STIs over the life course.",Early Adversity

"ACTION PAC: Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition & Physical Activity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The childhood obesity epidemic has led to the rising prevalence of cardiometabolic risks in adolescents. These risks include abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and pre-diabetes, the clustering of which is known as metabolic (or insulin resistance) syndrome. Longitudinal data show that children and adolescents with metabolic syndrome are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes. This is especially worrisome for youth in New Mexico, a culturally diverse state with 44.9% Hispanics and 9.7% American Indians, because obesity disproportionately affects these populations. School-based health centers (SBHCs) offer an important venue to expand healthcare access for adolescents, who are traditionally hard-to- reach. SBHCs provide health services to all students, with a focus on the uninsured and underserved and may be the only point of intervention for low-income and minority youth. The proposed R01 study will build upon significant findings from a NIH/NHLBI funded R21 study that utilized a community-based participatory research approach to develop and pilot-test a SBHC weight management program called Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition and Physical Activity (ACTION) with two high schools. ACTION was based on the use of motivational interviewing (MI) to support adoption of healthier eating and physical activity behaviors. In this current proposal (ACTION PAC), we propose to collaborate with eight high schools that have SBHCs to evaluate the broader reach and efficacy of using MI-based approaches to prevent and treat overweight/obesity and to decrease the risk of metabolic syndrome development. Specifically, our goals are to 1) prevent the development of overweight and obesity among students with BMI <85th percentile, 2) reduce BMI z score and insulin resistance in students with BMI >=85th percentile, and 3) obtain student and parent feedback on their experience with school-based BMI screening and weight management. To test the efficacy of these MI-based approaches, we will employ a cluster randomized control trial design in which four of the eight high schools will be randomized to an intervention group and the other four high schools will be randomized to a usual care comparison group. 960 participants in the 9th and 10th grades between the ages of 14-17 years will be followed annually for two years (until their 11th and 12th grade, respectively). Analyses will be conducted in a multilevel framework to account for clustering within schools. Baseline and 2nd year comparisons within group and comparison of change between the intervention and comparison groups will be assessed. The collective impact of these research outcomes will advance the field of school-based obesity intervention studies and take a significant step towards identifying sustainable prevention and treatment approaches for adolescent obesity and metabolic syndrome through the use of SBHCs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Healthy People 2020 has set objectives to: 1) increase the proportion of health care providers who regularly assess body mass index (BMI) in their adolescent patients, 2) increase the proportion of health care visits that include counseling related to nutrition, weight and physical activity, 3) reduce the proportion of adolescents who are obese, 4) prevent inappropriate weight gain in youth, 5) improve adolescent diet to include more fruits, vegetable and whole grains and less fats and added sugars, and 6) increase the proportion of adolescents who are physically active. The proposed project, ACTION PAC (Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition and Physical Activity), will address all of the above objectives by evaluating a method to motivate high school students to eat healthier, be physically active and achieve or maintain a healthy weight. Primary health care providers in school-based health centers will assess adolescents' BMI and work with them to adopt healthier behaviors to prevent access weight gain and assist those who are overweight or obese with weight management.",ACTION PAC: Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition & Physical Activity,8885510,R01HL118734,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', '

"Social Ecology and the Prevention of Suicide and Aggression in African American Y DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This indicated prevention intervention trial employs a randomized controlled design to examine the efficacy of a 15-session, culturally tailored, cognitive-behavioral group prevention intervention for urban, low income African American adolescents. The PI successfully adapted the Coping with Stress Course (Clarke et al., 1995) to be culturally sensitive and appropriate for use with urban, low-income African American adolescents. This culturally-adapted intervention (i.e., the Adapted-Coping with Stress Course [Robinson & Case, 2003]) will be significantly revised to enhance individual competencies believed to mitigate the risk for self-directed (i.e., suicidality) and inter-personal aggression. n addition, the proposed study aims to examine how neighborhood and family ecological characteristics moderate the effects of a culturally-adapted, cognitive-behavioral coping with stress prevention intervention on African American adolescents' self-directed (i.e., suicidality) and interpersonal aggression.  This study is expected to have broad public health implications toward the reduction of African American youth health disparities and inform practice and policy on the development of effective violence prevention interventions for African American youth. It is expected that this study will inform a future large scale effectiveness study that will embed an evidence-based, culturally sensitive violence prevention intervention within a large urban school system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is transformative and will provide vital knowledge pertaining to the understanding and prevention of African American youth violence, both self-directed and interpersonal. In addition to examining the efficacy of a culturally sensive prevention intervention, the proposed study aims to examine how neighborhood and family ecological characteristics moderate the effects of the culturally-adapted, cognitive-behavioral coping with stress prevention intervention.

"Acculturation and Reproductive Health Disparities in Mexican-Origin Adolescents     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective for this NRSA training grant in nursing research is to support the applicant's training as a nurse scientist committed to understanding and reducing reproductive health disparities in the Mexican-origin population in the United States. Reducing and eliminating health disparities is emphasized in the National Institute of Nursing Research's strategic plan and there are significant reproductive health disparities among Mexican-origin adolescent females in the U.S., including an increased risk for childbirth. Previous research on reproductive health behavior in adolescents has focused on individual and familial risk factors and has not addressed the heterogeneity of Latinos, including country of origin and immigrant status, which has limited exploration of the influence of structural factors. Furthermore, the role of culture and how it influences the reproductive health behavior of adolescents remains poorly understood. This training plan will provide support for a research project to investigate how cultural constructions of gender and sexuality mediate the relationship between structural factors and reproductive health behaviors in Mexican- origin adolescent females through three specific aims: (1) to investigate how structural factors (i.e., community level poverty, residential segregation) influence reproductive health behaviors (i.e., age at first birth, age at first sex, contraceptive use) across three immigrant generations of Mexican-origin adolescent females. This aim will be met through a secondary data analysis of The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. (2) To explore how cultural constructions of gender and sexuality differ across three immigrant generations of Mexican-origin adolescent females. This aim will be met through semi-structured life history interviews in a Mexican community in Denver, Colorado. (3) To explain how cultural constructions of gender and sexuality mediate the relationship between structural factors and reproductive health behaviors across three immigrant generations of Mexican-origin adolescent females. This aim will be met through the integration and analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data. This training plan i interdisciplinary, bio-behavioral, and utilizes a multi- level mixed quantitative and qualitative approach, which are strategies endorsed by NINR to improve nursing research. With the rapid growth of the Mexican-origin population in the U.S., coupled with significant health and economic disparities across the lifespan, this research project will address the gaps in the literature, is timely, and has potential to provide evidence for interventions that can reduce health disparities, improve population health, and increase the quality of life for Mexican-origin persons in the U.S.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mexican-origin adolescent females in the U.S. are at higher risk for childbirth than their white peers. This mixed methods project will contribute to a more thorough understanding of how cultural constructions of gender and sexuality mediate the relationship between structural factors and reproductive health behaviors of Mexican- origin adolescent females. The findings will be used to design interventions to reduce reproductive health disparities and improve the quality of life of Mexican-origin adolescent females.            ",Acculturation and Reproductive Health Disparities in Mexican-Origin Adolescents,8760211,F31NR013821,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth Rate ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' First Births ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' Persons ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Research ', ' Poverty ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Sexuality ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' teenage mom ', ' teen mother ', ' teen mom ', ' adolescent mother ', ' teenage mother ', ' Mexican ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Immigrant ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' life history ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' Categories ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Contraception ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Childbirth ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' NRSA ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' health economics ', ' rapid growth ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Coupled ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' child bearing ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' population health ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,F31,2015,8347,0.10888509816174044
"Testing a Latino web-based parent-adolescent sexual communication intervention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latino adolescents, especially those living in Puerto Rico, are at high risk for HIV/AIDS, other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unintended pregnancies. A web-based parent communication intervention provides an opportunity to benefit adolescents by providing additional support for safer sex decisions, and to increase parents' involvement in sexual health by decreasing barriers that keep them from participating in these interventions. The purpose of this proposed study is to evaluate a brief, theoretically informed, culturally appropriate, and linguistically tailored web-based parental communication program, Cu�dalos (""Take care of them""), designed to improve parent-adolescent sexual communication and reduce adolescent sexual risk behavior. Recent findings from an R21 RCT testing a brief computer-based version of the Cu�dalos program indicated that the program increased parent-adolescent general communication and sexual risk communication with English and Spanish speaking U.S. Latinos.7 In this proposed study, we plan to modify the Cu�dalos intervention by changing to a web-based format, increasing the amount of content related to sexual communication and adding a module on HIV/AIDS stigma. In this RCT, we will recruit parents (n=680) and one of their adolescents (n=680) from community-based agencies in Puerto Rico, and will be randomly assigned to receive either the parent-based Cu�dalos intervention or a web-based health promotion control condition. Parents and adolescents will complete measures at pre-intervention and at 3-(parents only), 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. We will address the five following specific aims: 1) Does the Cu�dalos intervention increase parents' comfort with, as well as the amount of, communication with adolescents and decrease stigma at 3-,6-, and 12- month follow-ups as compared to the general health promotion control intervention; 2) Does the Cu�dalos intervention decrease self-reported adolescent intercourse and unprotected intercourse at the follow-ups as compared to the general health promotion control intervention; 3) Do theory-based variables (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, intentions) mediate the intervention effects of Cu�dalos on parents' communication with their adolescents; 4) Are the effects of the Cu�dalos intervention on adolescent sexual behavior and parent-adolescent communication moderated by individual (adolescents: sexual experience, gender, age, stigma; parents: gender, age computer access/experience, frequency and time engaged in the program), and microsystem (adolescents: parent-adolescent communication) variables; and 5) Puerto Rican and Latino youth, the lack of culturally and linguistically effectiv interventions for Latino parents and adolescents, and the absence of web-based interventions for Latinos. If the program is efficacious, the web-based format will accelerate the translation of this program into public health practice and will be an important contribution in supporting safe adolescent sexual health behaviors. Is the intervention cost-effective? This study addresses existing disparities in sexual health outcomes among PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this study will provide an important resource to parents and adolescents to support adolescents' safer sex decisions. Results from testing and using a web-based format will provide important information for the development of future parent-adolescent sexual risk reduction programs and health related technology based interventions for this and other underserved populations.",Testing a Latino web-based parent-adolescent sexual communication intervention,9071150,R01NR013505,"['Age ', ' Attitude ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Programs ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Programmed Learning ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Test Result ', ' experience ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Safe Sex ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' cost ', ' microsystems ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,398897,0.10281144923524847
"Identifying Environmental Factors Promoting HIV/STI Risk in Black Adolescents and Young Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect Black adolescents and young adults in the United States. Environmental or structural factors such as discrimination, crime, and poverty have been proposed as potential drivers of persistent racial disparities. Though HIV and STI incidence tend to be geospatially clustered, the specific environmental predictors of clustering among Black adolescents and young adults are not well understood. Exploratory mapping using geographic information systems (GIS) has revealed that HIV and STI incidence in adolescents and young adults is higher in certain neighborhoods in Massachusetts, the setting of the proposed project. Determining the associations between specific environmental factors in neighborhoods and HIV/STI incidence in Black adolescents and young adults is important for intervention planning. Candidate: My career goal is to become an independent investigator focused on developing structural interventions for HIV/STI prevention in underserved communities. As a physician trained in Infectious Diseases, I am fully committed to overcoming persistent health disparities noted among people at risk for and living with HIV and STIs. To become an independent investigator, I require additional research training and mentorship, building on the clinical, publc health, and implementation science training that I have previously received. Research Proposal: The primary objective of this proposal is to determine the relationships between neighborhood-level environmental factors and HIV/STI incidence in Black adolescents and young adults. The proposed study has three AIMs: (1) to qualitatively explore the impact that environmental factors have on HIV and STI risk behavior by conducting focus groups with Black adolescents and young adults from higher and lower HIV/STI incidence neighborhoods; (2) to quantitatively determine the association between selected environmental factors and HIV/STI incidence using geospatial analysis; and (3) to use a mixed- methods participatory approach to identify interventions to address environmental factors associated with HIV/STIs using data gathered in AIMs 1 and 2. Training: The research plan will be supported by courses in qualitative, quantitative, and geospatial analyses, clinical trial design and utilization of large scale socio-behavioral and demographic data sets for secondary analyses. Mentorship and Resources: My mentorship team will be co-led by Dr. Kenneth Mayer, Infectious Disease Specialist and expert in HIV/STI prevention and Dr. Laura Bogart, social psychologist with expertise in disparities in HIV, adolescent health, and qualitative and quantitative methods. To achieve my goals, I will avail myself of the resources available within the Division of Global Health Equity at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Fenway Institute of Fenway Health (www.thefenwayinstitute.org), and the Harvard Center for AIDS Research. I will also benefit from a team of dedicated advisors in geospatial analysis, behavioral health and adolescent sexual health.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect Black adolescents and young adults. Environmental or structural factors - practices, policies, institutional and contextual forces that are external to and outsideof an individual's control - may promote or protect against HIV/STI acquisition and contribute to persistent racial disparities. Discrimination, crime, poverty and community beliefs about homosexuality are environmental factors that may be associated with HIV and STI risk in Black adolescents and young adults. Both HIV/STI incidence and these environmental factors tend to be clustered geographically. However, the specific environmental predictors of HIV/STI clustering among Black adolescents and young adults are not well understood. This research seeks to understand the relationships between neighborhood-level environmental factors and HIV/STI incidence in Black adolescents and young adults. Determining the associations between specific environmental factors and HIV/STI risk and incidence is important for focused intervention planning in this vulnerable population.                ",Identifying Environmental Factors Promoting HIV/STI Risk in Black Adolescents and Young Adults,8924725,K23MH107316,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anger ', ' Belief ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Crime ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Homosexuality ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Maps ', ' Massachusetts ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychologist ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Institutional Policy ', ' Measures ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Review Literature ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' American ', ' skills ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' psychological distress ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' behavioral health ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' trial design ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' implementation science ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia  ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' ']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2015,183356,0.0910183484452519
"Early Life Determinants of Accelerated Pubertal Development in Adolescent Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Kubo's long-term career goal is to understand early-life determinants of cancer risk factors that relate to obesity and metabolic dysregulation, and to identify high-risk sub-populations that can benefit from early intervention strategies. Her primary research aim is to examine whether factors such as intrauterine exposure to maternal gestational diabetes (GDM), excessive gestational weight gain, obesity, and rapid infant weight gain increase the risk of accelerated pubertal onset in adolescent girls, an important breast and reproductive cancer risk factor. Her secondary aim is to explore the causes of the observed racial/ethnic differences in timing of puberty. No previous studies have examined these associations. These research goals will take advantage of electronic health data that are available in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated health plan that covers about 450,000 girls. Two specific approaches are proposed: 1. Linkage of mothers' and daughters' electronic health data in an on-going prospective study of predictors of sexual maturation in adolescent girls (U01 ES/CA019435) (Study 1); and, 2. Establishment of a new cohort of 20,000 multiethnic mother-daughter pairs using the electronic databases within KPNC (Study 2). Study 1 will utilize data from the CYGNET study (PI: Lawrence H. Kushi, ScD), which has been following 444 girls annually since 2005 with extensive information on pubertal development and anthropometric measures. The KPNC GDM and Pregnancy Glucose Tolerance Registry (Director: Assiamira Ferrara, MD, PhD) will be linked to the CYGNET data to accomplish study 1. In addition, the Registry will be used to establish a new cohort of mother-daughter pairs. This will allow Dr. Kubo gain experience and skills in establishing and follow a cohort based on KPNC electronic medical record data, and to explore racial/ethnic differences in pubertal onset. Electronic documentation of Tanner stage (an established five-stage classification scheme to assess pubertal development) from routine pediatric visits has recently been implemented at KPNC, and this availability on a large and diverse pediatric population makes this study unique and innovative. The candidate's research goals will be complemented with formal, mentored training through coursework and tailored tutorials in pediatric endocrinology, intergenerational transmission of metabolic dysregulation, advanced biostatistics, cancer prevention and health disparities, and responsible conduct of research. KPNC's Division of Research is an ideal environment for the proposed training because it provides unique and extensive electronic databases, access to data from a large, multiethnic membership, and internationally-recognized multidisciplinary experts. The planned scientific training and mentorship will build on the candidate's previous training in nutrition and cancer epidemiology, and uniquely position her to attain her goals. The proposed studies will provide crucial skills in establishing a new cohort, providing a platform for Dr. Kubo to develop successful R01 research to further elucidate early life determinants of pubertal onset and other cancer risk factors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past century, adolescent girls have been maturing significantly earlier in the United States, with substantial racial/ethnic differences. Early-maturing girls are at risk for a variety of negative health outcomes, including increased risk of breast and other reproductive cancers, though aside from obesity, little is known as to what early life factors influence the timing of pubertal development. The proposed research will allow me to better understand early determinants of accelerated pubertal development in girls and to identify high risk populations, which can inform future effective

"Assessing an adherence intervention for adolescents with kidney transplants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Dr. Amaral is a pediatric nephrologist at Emory-University, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (Emory-CHOA), where she has initiated an adolescent transition clinic. She has a Masters in Health Science from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Her broad long, term career goals are to 1)become a pioneer in the development of evidence- based transitional care strategies for adolescents with chronic illness and 2)to assess and develop practices to eliminate health disparities in transplantation. Her proposed project is directed toward the first of these goals. Research: In this project, Dr. Amaral proposes to address the important problem of poor allograft survival in adolescent kidney transplant recipients due to nonadherence. Her first aim is to conduct a single center phase II randomized controlled trial that will test the effectiveness of a peer mentoring program to improve medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) versus usual care in adolescents with kidney transplants. She will measure HRQOL by written survey and medication adherence by the Brief Medication Questionnaire and pharmacy refill data. Her second aim is to determine the mechanisms by which peer mentoring impacts medication adherence and HRQOL. Specifically, she hypothesizes that peer mentoring provides social support which increases patient self-efficacy and leads to positive health outcomes. Her proposed peer-mentoring program will be telephone-based, with e-communication as deemed mutually agreeable to mentors and mentees. This approach is novel and practical, meeting patients in their ""real world."" Environment: The Emory-CHOA Pediatric Transplant Center is one of the busiest in the country, providing a rich population of patients for Dr. Amaral's single center proposal. Dr. Amaral has formed a solid team of mentors from the Dept. of Pediatrics (Dr. Larry Greenbaum), Dept. of Transplant Surgery (Dr. Allan Kirk) and School of Public Health (Dr. Arriola and Prof. Easley) to facilitate her success. Dr. Arriola has research experience with peer mentoring, having developed a program of patient navigators for African American women with breast cancer. The Rollins School of Public Health offers several relevant courses to Dr. Amaral's career development. The Department of Pediatrics is committed to the success of young investigators, providing support for statistical analysis, grantsmanship and manuscript preparation as well as opportunities to engage with the research community through the Pediatric Research Center. This project's aims are directed at improving the health of adolescents with solid organ transplants by improving medication adherence and consequently long-term allograft function. Patients who maintain functioning transplants have better quality of life and live longer than those who have failed grafts and return to dialysis. This project's aims are well matched to the NIH's mission to supportive investigative efforts to improve health and save lives. Adolescents with chronic disease are at increased risk for nonadherence as they become young adults. This study will compare adherence and health related quality of life outcomes in two groups of adolescents with kidney transplants: those who receive peer mentoring vs. those who do not, using a primarily telephone-based approach with e-communication tailored to the mentee's interests and resources. Scientific knowledge gained from this study can be used to inform other adolescent chronic disease programs and to prevent allograft loss in adolescents with kidney transplants.",Assessing an adherence intervention for adolescents with kidney transplants,8913144,K23DK083529,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Stone ', ' Biliary or Urinary Stones ', ' Calculi ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Positive Reinforcements ', ' Psychology ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Organ ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' Allografting ', ' psychosocial ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' pediatric department ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Manuscripts ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Pediatric Research ', ' SF-36 ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' beneficiary ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outcome ', ' driving force ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' graft failure ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' data registry ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' ']",NIDDK,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K23,2015,172292,-0.023084711919670636
"Smartphone Technology for Parents and Teens: Improving Vaccination Uptake ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vaccinations for adolescents in the U.S. (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis - Tdap; meningococcal conjugate vaccine - MCV4; Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines - Gardasil and Cervarex) remain well below the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) goals, and especially so for the HPV vaccines. These vaccine deficits are pronounced among minority adolescents, constituting an important health disparity. A recent publication by the President's Cancer Panel has called for renewed effort in messaging to adolescents and their parents that would prompt informed decision-making about the adolescent vaccine series, and improved vaccine uptake. Failure to improve this situation will result in a cohort of young adults, especially minority adults, needlessly at risk for a variey of disease sequalae, both short and long-term in nature. Proposed here is smartphone application-based strategy to provide effective messaging about the importance of adolescent vaccination. An initial module smartphone application - Be Vaccinated - BVac - will be systematically developed in Phase I of the project, employing an Expert Advisory Board, a Medical Practitioner Advisory Board, and an iterative series of Parent and Teen focus groups designed to address concerns about vaccination, accurate information about vaccination, and logistical hurdles to vaccination. Focus groups for parents and teens will aid in content definition, and then in multimedia design and usability. The Expert Advisory Board and the Medical Practitioner Advisory Board will review the outcomes of the iterative focus group cycles, and aid the research group in the specifications of the initial module of BVac. The deliverables of Phase I will be the initial BVac module, with a specifications document describing the remaining modules. In Phase II of the project, the remaining BVac smartphone modules will be produced, along with a Spanish version of the BVac modules. A community-level randomized trial of the BVac modules will be conducted, with vaccine uptake as the endpoint outcome. The commercial potential of the BVac smartphone application, in both English and Spanish, will be strong with potential commercial use by Accountable Care Organizations across the U.S.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The uptake of adolescent vaccines in the U.S. is far below recommended levels, particularly so for the Human Papillomavirus vaccines, and especially so among minority and disadvantaged families. Proposed here is a smartphone application that will accurately inform parents and teens about the adolescent vaccination series, address ongoing concerns about adolescent vaccination particularly in minority communities, identify sites for vaccination, and schedule vaccination appointments. An initial smartphone application module will be systematically developed and tested in Phase I research, with the remaining modules developed and the complete application (in both Spanish and English) tested in a randomized efficacy trial in Phase II research.            ",Smartphone Technology for Parents and Teens: Improving Vaccination Uptake,8905680,R41HD082901,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Appointment ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Varicella ', ' Chicken Pox ', ' Chickenpox ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Diphtheria ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Prepaid Group Health Organizations ', ' Health Maintenance Organizations ', ' Health Planning ', ' Infection ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Parents ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' clostridial tetanus ', ' Tetanus ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Whooping Cough ', ' Pertussis ', ' Employee Health ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Schedule ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Conjugate Vaccines ', ' Link ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' uptake ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Nature ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Health Communication ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', "" President's Cancer Panel "", ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' STTR ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' Update ', ' Vaccinated ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Gardasil ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' vaccination schedule ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NICHD,"KLEIN BUENDEL, INC.",R41,2015,210279,0.0007465763989862812
"Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to Reach Vulnerable Young Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Vulnerable female adolescents in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town who use alcohol and other drugs (AOD) and have dropped out of school experience the greatest burden of new HIV infections in South Africa. The risk for acquiring HIV is perpetuated through intersecting factors of AOD use, gender inequality, sexual risk, victimization, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence. Despite the pervasive ongoing transmission of HIV, this vulnerable population remains underserved by current HIV and drug treatment programs, with few providing HIV testing and counselling (HTC), antenatal care, or substance abuse rehabilitation, and none providing comprehensive HTC programs that address these intersecting risks for HIV among this population. Since 2001, we have adapted and conducted a comprehensive evidence-based intervention for women, the Women's Health CoOp (WHC), that addresses AOD use, sexual risk, and gender-based violence. The WHC was listed in the USAID Compendium of Gender Studies in Africa. The Young Women's CoOp (YWC) is an adaptation of the WHC that targets this vulnerable population of AOD using female adolescents. This proposed RFA project seeks to reach this hard-to-reach population and overcome barriers to improved health for female adolescents who have dropped out of school by increasing update of HTC through a comprehensive gender-focused HTC intervention with trained peer co-facilitators and outreach workers from each community. The study findings may provide knowledge that could be used to increase the uptake of services and improve treatment adherence among female adolescents through the use of peer-driven intervention methods. Specific Aims: Our specific aims including the following. In a cluster randomized trial conducted in 12 disadvantaged communities in Cape Town, South Africa, and with government collaboration, we propose: Aim 1. To train and evaluate adolescent peer role models to conduct community outreach with established outreach workers to recruit 500 out-of schools, substance-using female adolescents aged 15-19 for HTC, and to co-facilitate a gender-focused comprehensive HTC program. Aim 2. To test the efficacy of a young women's gender-focused comprehensive HTC program for reducing substance use, victimization, and sexual risk behavior (primary outcomes) and improving access to effective treatment and support services through linkages to care (substance abuse treatment, HIV, STIs, antenatal and reproductive health as secondary outcomes) relative to standard HTC for adolescent females. This study's collaboration with the Western Cape-Department of Social Development and the City of Cape Town will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention within community centers will most likely ensure greater sustainability where it is needed most.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact for the proposed study is tri-fold and described as follows. First, reaching 500 adolescent females in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town with its high rates of school dropout (and often consequent unemployment), substance use, gender inequality, sexual risk, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence is essential for HTC and risk reduction, as these intersecting risk factors appear to be antecedents to the overwhelming gender differences in HIV prevalence among young women relative to men in this region. Second, this study's collaboration with the WC-DoSD will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention and is likely to ensure sustainabiliy of the intervention within communities. Third, determining the efficacy of the comprehensive gender intervention for greater application will be essential for the most at-risk female adolescents.             ",Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to Reach Vulnerable Young Women,8991043,R01DA041227,"['young woman ', ' reduced substance use ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Africa ', ' Belief ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Female ', ' Financial Support ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' Health Care Seeking Behavior ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Social Development ', ' South Africa ', ' School Dropouts ', ' Student Dropouts ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' USAID ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' sexually active ', ' Inequality ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' uptake ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' motherhood ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Side ', ' Country ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' treatment program ', ' gang ', ' outreach ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Drops ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' gang violence ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' nineteen year old ', ' age 19 years ', ' 19 year old ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' sexual violence ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' treatment adherence ', ' efficacy testing ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' substance using adolescents ', ' ']",NIDA,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2015,397469,0.04340875552569024
"Treatment for Latino/a Adolescents with Suicidal Behavior DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching career goal of Yovanska Duarte-Velez, Assistant Research Scientist, at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras Campus (UPR-RP), is to become an independent mental health researcher in clinical interventions for suicidal adolescents and their families, with a specialization in Latino populations. One of her future objectives is to conduct multisite clinical trials of innovative treatments in Puerto Rico ad the United States. Her specific career goals are: 1) develop research skills to conduct randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in real world settings with high risk adolescents; 2) develop research skills to conduct cross-cultural and health disparity research in multisite studies; 3) gain knowledge of procedures to assess observable family variables and neurobehavioral and neurocognitive markers that may prove to be underlying mechanisms of change in treatment outcomes for suicidal adolescents and incorporate these measures in treatment research; and 4) improve knowledge of and gain experience with statistical analyses used in treatment research. These goals will be achieved through: 1) Drs. Spirito (RCT with suicidal adolescents) and Bernal's (Latino mental health) mentorship; 2) consultations with Drs. Canino (multisite & cross-cultural research), Alegria (health disparities & cross-cultural research), Goldston (intervention development), Stout (statistical methods) and Dickstein (neurobehavioral and neurocognitive mechanisms); 3) courses, seminars, workshops, and special training; and 4) execution of the proposed research project. The proposed award will be carried out at Brown University for the first two years and at UPR-RP for the last three years. The primary aim of the proposed research is to evaluate the feasibility of a socio-cognitive-behavioral therapy protocol for suicidal behavior (SCBT-SB protocol) with Latino/a adolescents. The Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) treatment protocol will include developmental and cultural factors in order to optimize treatment outcomes in suicidal Latino/a adolescents. Specifics aims are: 1) refine the treatment protocol to expand its applicability to Latino population in U.S. based on feedback from therapists working with Latino and suicidal adolescents in RI and on a small open trial; 2) develop and implement a training program for the protocol; and 3) conduct a pilot RCT of the SCBT-SB versus treatment as usual (TAU). This proposed project's public health significance is evident, as it addresses two Healthy People 2020 Objectives: MHMD HP2020-1: ""Reduce the suicide rate"" and MHMD HP-2: ""Reduce the rate of suicide attempts by adolescents."" Its clinical significance lies in the fact that there is little evidence of treatment efficacy for suicidal adolescents and there are evident disparities in the delivery of quality clinical services for Latio populations. Its scientific significance is that it tests the feasibility of a novel treatment apprach that aims to incorporate new perspectives relevant to Latino families and minority youth. It also addresses the third strategic objective of the NIMH, which is to: ""Develop new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illness."" PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Culturally sensitive treatment for suicidal minority youth and clinical investigators devoted to high suicide risk and underserved population are nearly absent. The proposed training grant allows Dr. Duarte-Velez to gain expertise in treatment development according to the needs and challenges faced by suicidal minority youths (e.g. ethnic, sexual) and their families. The primary aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the feasibility of a novel cognitive behavioral treatment protocol that integrates developmental and cultural factors to target suicidal behavior

"PS11-003 Minority AIDS Research Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed study aims to address health disparities between Hispanic and non-Hispanic whites, particularly as it relates to HIV and drug use in Hispanic adolescents. This goal will be accomplished by two aims: AIM I is to develop an Internet-based version of the face-to-face Familias Unidas intervention (hereafter referred to as Internet-Based Familias Unidas); and AIM II is to evaluate the efficacy of Internet-Based Familias Unidas, relative to both face-to-face Familias Unidas and a community practice control condition, in preventing unprotected sexual behavior and drug use in a community sample of Hispanic adolescents living in Miami-Dade County. 270 Hispanic adolescents recruited from three high schools will be randomized using an urn design to one of three conditions: Internet-Based Familias Unidas, face-to-face Familias Unidas or Community Practice. Face-to-face Familias Unidas, a Hispanic-specific, family- centered intervention, has been found efficacious, relative to control conditions, in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior and drug use in two randomized clinical trials (Pantin et al., 2009; Prado et al., 2007).

"Culturally-Specific HIV Prevention with Latino Adolescent Alcohol Abusers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 research and training award advances the long-term goal of reducing ethnic/racial health disparities in HIV/AIDS infection. The proposed training and research plans will enable the PI to develop the skills needed for an independent research career in this area of research. The objective of this application is to develop skills in HIV prevention research and the use of Community-Based Participatory Research and qualitative data collection methods to inform the development of an intervention which targets specific risk and protective factors associated with Hispanic adolescents' drinking and sexual risk taking behaviors. Data demonstrate that both sexual risk behaviors and alcohol use are prominent among Hispanic adolescents, and that the co- occurrence of these behaviors are directly associated with HIV/AIDS infection. Despite literature demonstrating the influence that intrapersonal factors, contextual factors, and culturally specific factors play in Hispanic adolescents' drinking and sexual risk taking behaviors, to date, no interventions addressing all three of these factors exists. This application addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a culturally specific HIV prevention intervention addressing risk and protective factors within these three domains to reduce Hispanic adolescents' risk of HIV infection. Specifically, the culturally specific intervention will include: 1) an adolescent Individual Motivational Interview (IMI) to address alcohol- and sex-related expectancies and attitudes, and alcohol refusal and safe sex behavioral intentions and self-efficacy; 2) a parent Motivational Interview to address parental monitoring and supervision and alcohol- and sex-related family communication; and, 3) an additional module designed to address acculturation conflicts between parents and adolescents, to restore the protective factors of familismo and respeto, and increase adolescents' ethnic identity and pride. A three-phase top-down research approach to adapt, refine, and pilot test the preventative intervention will be conducted. Phase I will include focus groups with Hispanic adolescents and parents and initial manual development. Phase II will include therapist training, an open pilot trial, qualitative exit interviews, and further manual revisions. Phase III will inclde a small-randomized clinical trial with 75 families recruited and randomly assigned to a culturally specific HIV prevention intervention, a standard HIV prevention intervention, or an assessment only condition. Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary indication of a reduction in HIV risk behavior and alcohol use will be examined at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. To enable the PI to pursue this long- term research agenda, she will work with experienced mentors to build four areas of expertise: (1) expertise in HIV prevention research; (2) expertise in the use of Community-Based Participatory Research methods; (3) skills for conducting qualitative research; and (4) skills in developing integrated alcohol and sexual risk interventions. This K01 addresses a key priority in HIV prevention science, and it will fully prepare the PI for an independent research career in the field. The long-term objectives of this application include 1) reducing and eliminating health disparities in HIV infection and alcohol use disorders among ethnic/racial groups, and 2) increasing access to care among ethnic/racial groups through the development of community-based and culturally appropriate interventions. This application also addresses Healthy People 2020's objectives ""to increase the proportion of adolescents who are connected to a parent,"" ""to reduce the proportion of students engaging in binge

"Does chronotype modify the relationship between sleep and BMI in adolescents?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reversing and/or preventing obesity during adolescence yields significant cardio-metabolic rewards. Yet, 90% of obese adolescents become obese adults. This highlights the difficulty in reversing obesity once onset occurs. Additionally, progress in preventing childhood obesity has been slow. Despite promising trends, the widening gulf between minorities and lower socio-economic youth and their non-minority, more affluent counterparts threatens our ability to reduce health disparities in the future. Targeting adolescents for obesity prevention holds great promise for stemming high obesity rates. Theoretical, experimental, and epidemiological support for an association between sleep and obesity exists. However, not all short sleepers are overweight/obese and vice versa and extant studies report inconsistent findings.  This observational study in a lower socio-economic racially diverse school district in NJ seeks to explore whether chronotype modifies the association between short sleep and obesity in adolescents. This study will be one of the first to explore this association. It will involve collaborative efforts with school nurses, physicians, heath teachers, school district administrators, the parent teacher association, and the community at large, thus exemplifying a strong community partnership. It exemplifies how future nurse scientists may lead the way in providing evidence for bio-behavioral approaches to preventing/reversing obesity in adolescents. This proposal is consistent with the applicant's long-term goal to explore chronobiological factors impacting adolescent obesity and sleep and to establish a program of interdisciplinary research aimed at preventing/reducing childhood obesity and current/future health disparities.  Findings from this study will influence policy and clinical practice. Sensitivity of adolescent circadian rhythms to evening light exposure increases the propensity for later chronotypes. Therefore, urban planning and development policies should seek to limit the exposure to light at night by adolescents. Street lighting, field lighting, and community signage should be limited and/or designed to emit lux below a specified threshold in specified areas. School and community athletic policies limiting high school games/practices during late evening hours in lit athletic fields/gymnasiums will also be warranted. Parent/student education coupled with effective strategies for limiting nighttime exposure from light emitting technology will also be important. Screening for late chronotype throughout adolescence will identify those at greatest risk for deleterious metabolic effects. Interventions such as parentally enforced bedtimes, morning light exposure, and support for later high school start times will help maintain circadian alignment limiting deleterious health effects, such as increased BMI, in adolescents with late chronotypes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Preventing obesity onset in adolescents holds the key to reducing the burden of obesity. Whether greater risk for the metabolically deleterious effects of short sleep is associated with chronotypes is unexplored. This study will be one of the first to explore this association in adolescents            ",Does chronotype modify the relationship between sleep and BMI in

"Family Aggression and Trajectories of Adolescent Adaptation: Bioregulatory Effect DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aggressive marital conflict and harsh parenting (family aggression) are highly prevalent. Chronic exposure to family aggression elevates adolescents' risk for antisocial and risky behavior, depressed mood, and cognitive decrements - significant public health problems that increase in prevalence and severity during adolescence. Explaining variability in trajectories of adaptation in the context of family aggression - why some adolescent's exhibit resilience and others deteriorate - is a critical need for science and practice. Findings stemming from the proposed study will illuminate autonomic nervous system activity and sleep regulation variables (bioregulatory processes), as well as economic and social context (peer affiliation) variables, which may mediate the risk of family aggression or operate to exacerbate or protect against its effects on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral maladjustment from late childhood through late adolescence. The design builds on a well-characterized 3-wave study; children ranged between 8-11 years across waves. The proposed study will involve 3 additional waves with a 1-year lag: 50% girls, ~14-15 years at T4, with high representation of both African-American and lower SES families. Study constructs are assessed with multiple informants and measures. Sleep parameters are examined objectively, via actigraphy, and subjectively. ANS activity (sympathetic and parasympathetic) is measured with standard indices, and reactivity is assessed with well-established lab procedures. The large and diverse sample, breadth of measurement across important adolescent outcome domains, and a 6-wave longitudinal design will permit analyses of long- term developmental trajectories, interactions among biopsychosocial processes, and profiles of family, bioregulatory and socioecological risk. The proposed study will create new knowledge in areas of great significance through investigations of bioregularoty and socioecological variables that have the potential to enhance understanding of risk among adolescents exposed to family aggression and to identify physiological, behavioral, and ecological targets for intervention. Outcome variables include public health priorities, such as behavioral and emotional adjustment, academic performance (PA-07-046, Research on Mind-Body Interactions and Health), violence (PA-09-169, Research on Teen Dating Violence), and sleep disturbances (PA-07-140, Research on Sleep and Sleep Disorders). Hypotheses will be tested across a wide range of socioecological contexts with a diverse community sample (PA-07-379, Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities). Other key strengths include our focus on estimating trajectories of adolescent functioning across multiple domains; considering the direction of effects between constructs; and comparing the strength of associations at different time points across development. Aggressive marital conflict and harsh parenting are highly prevalent and elevate adolescents' risk for antisocial and risky behavior, depressed mood, and cognitive decrements- significant public health problems that increase in prevalence and severity during adolescence. However, the potential effects of bioregulatory and socioecological variables on trajectories of adolescent adjustment in the context of family aggression are not well understood. The proposed study will illuminate autonomic nervous system activity, sleep regulation, and socioecological variables that may mediate the risk of family aggression or operate to exacerbate or protect against its effects on adolescent functioning across multiple domains from late childhood through late adolescence, which will help identify behavioral, physiological, and ecological targets for prevention and intervention.",Family Aggression and Trajectories of Adolescent Adaptation: Bioregulatory Effect,8847748,R01HD046795,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Economics ', ' Moderator Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Effect Modifiers ', ' Conditional Variables ', ' Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology) ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Methods ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Schedule ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Staging ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' mind body interaction ', ' brain-body interaction ', ' Relations, Mind-Body (Physiology) ', ' Mind-Body Relationship (Physiology) ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' emotional style ', ' emotional adaptation ', ' emotional adjustment ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' Performance ', ' sleep control ', ' sleep regulation ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' actigraphy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Developmental Process ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' Teen Dating Violence ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' negative mood ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' peer influence ', ' stem ', ' social science research ', ' public health priorities ', ' longitudinal design ', ' ']",NICHD,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,R01,2015,523197,0.09303270347757109
"A Community-Academic Partnership to Address Disparities in Obesity Among Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over one-third of US adolescents are obese or overweight, and large racial/ethnic disparities exist in obesity/ overweight rates. In the racially/ethnically diverse Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), the second largest US school district and the community partner for this application, obesity and overweight prevalence (46%) is higher than the national average, und Black and Latino students have the highest prevalence. We have partnered with LUUSD to translate obesity policy into practice through NlMHD's R24 community-based participatory research (CBPR) Planning and Intervention Grants, for which we developed, pilot tested, and conducted a randomized controlled trial of our middle-school-based obesity prevention intervention, Students for Nutrition and exercise (SNaX). In this Dissemination Phase application, we seek funds to transition the intervention from research to practice. SNaX is a multi-level intervention that includes changes to the school food environment (e.g., sliced fruit and vegetable offerings; informational signage; free water at lunchtime), peer advocacy, and school-wide multimedia promotion. Our RCT results showed that SNaX is both effective at increasing healthy eating and cost-effective, and thus meets criteria as an evidence-based program worthy of dissemination. The specific aims are to use a theory-driven strategy and CBPR principles: 1) to synthesize and disseminate information about adolescent obesity prevention in general and SNaX in particular to community and academic stakeholders; 2) to enhance the general organizational and program- specific capacity of LAUSD to implement SNaX and maintain delivery of SNaX beyond the project period; 3) to disseminate and implement the SNaX program in LAUSD middle schools; and 4) to evaluate the SNeX dissemination and implementation process, including the domains of program reach, recruitment, efficacy, adoption, retention, implementation fidelity, and maintenance. We plan to use an iterative process, in which we initially launch dissemination in LAUSD's North region. We will evaluate and refine the dissemination process using a validated framework that includes program facility checklists, debriefing interviews with staff and students, and analyses of cafeteria records and physical fitness data. After the dissemination test, LAUSD plans to implement SNaX in middle schools across the rest of the district. Ultimately, we intend to find ways to disseminate SNaX more broadly, using lessons learned from the LAUSD dissemination process to guide entry into other school districts. Our goal is to bring obesity prevention out of the research realm and into communities, and thereby achieve enduring real-world changes in public health through the reduction and eventual elimination of disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of obesity and overweight among US adolescents remains high, with substantial disparities by race/ethnicity. In partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAESD) and community stakeholders, we developed; pilot tested, and conducted a randomized controlled trial if Students for Nutrition and eXercise (SNaX), an obesity prevention intervention that aims to reduce racial/ethnic disparities. We propose to partner with LAUSD to disseminate and implement SNaX in LAUSD middle schools and maintain implementation of SNaX in LAUSD beyond the project period.",A Community-Academic Partnership to Address Disparities in Obesity Among Youth,8823610,R24MD001648,"['Adoption ', ' Boston ', ' Budgets ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Maintenance ', ' Marketing ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' nutrient requirement ', ' Nutritional Requirements ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Physical Fitness ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Sales ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Department of Agriculture (U.S.) ', ' United States Department of Agriculture ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Physical activity ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Policies ', ' Food Policy ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' meetings ', ' empowered ', ' drinking water ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' junior high school ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Slice ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' environmental change ', ' obesity prevention ', ' soft drink ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' nineteen year old ', ' age 19 years ', ' 19 year old ', ' Evidence based program ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' research into practice ', ' research to practice ', ' evidence base ', ' food environment ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R24,2015,570931,0.02268533487797483
"Disparities in Health and Academics of Sexual Minorities in Urban Middle Schools DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide among lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning (LGBQ) adolescents is a public health concern (Haas, et al., 2010). Recent research demonstrates that anti-LGB prejudice at school and among peers contributes to health risks for LGBQ teens (Russell, Kosciw, Horn, Saewyc, 2010).This project focuses on the experiences of urban, ethnically diverse LGBQ middle school adolescents - a vulnerable yet understudied population - and seeks to identify factors that contribute to risk and resilience for well-being an academic achievement in this group. The first study uses the BIAS MAP (Cuddy, Fiske & Glick, 2007) and draws on the developmental friendship literature (Hallinan & Williams, 1989) to systematically assess intergroup attitudes, peer relations, and school climate and test their impact on psychological and academic outcomes for both LGBQ and heterosexual students. Survey data will be collected from 800 Asian, Black, Latino and White boys and girls enrolled in 7th and 8th grades at several large urban schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). Participants will complete measures assessing their stereotypes, prejudices and behavioral tendencies toward various ethnic LGBQ individuals, their same - and cross-ethnic and cross-sexual orientation friendships, perceived vulnerability at school, and school ethnic diversity as well as students' psychosocial well-being and academic achievement. It is expected that positive intergroup attitudes and school climate, better cross ethnic/sexual orientation friendships and greater ethnic diversity will contribute to enhanced well- being and academic achievement of both LGBQ and heterosexual adolescents of various ethnic groups. The second study employs a well-established experimental paradigm to test whether observing LGB-based victimization impacts the well-being of heterosexual adolescents. Heterosexual Latino boys (n= 120) and Latina girls (n = 120) enrolled in 7th and 8th grades will take part in a virtual ball-tossing computer game called Cyberball (Williams, Cheung, & Choi, 2000) during which they witness a Latino/a lesbian, gay or bisexual student excluded or included in the game. Each participant will complete measures of psychological well-being (i.e., state self-esteem), stereotypes, prejudices and behavioral tendencies toward Latino lesbian, gay and bisexual students; friendships (e.g., number of LGB friends), and the degree to which the participant perceives sexual minority Latinos as in-group. It is expected that witnessing the exclusion of LGB youth perceived to be an in-group member will negatively affect the well-being of the heterosexual observer. A combination of cluster analysis, hierarchical linear modeling and SEM multiple group analysis will be used to test the hypotheses in both studies. Knowledge gained from this program of research can inform prevention and intervention programs suited for implementation in our nation's urban schools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Suicide among lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning (LGBQ) adolescents is a public health concern and research traces the health risks for LGBQ teens to hostile environments. This project focuses on the experiences of urban, ethnically diverse LGBQ middle school adolescents and identifies factors that contribute to risk and resilience for their well-being and academic achievement.

"CBPR to Reduce Adolescent Pregnancy and HIV in a DC Public Housing Community     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The District of Columbia is home to both many of the most affluent and most vulnerable communities in the nation. Public housing communities in the city represent the extremes of concentrated disadvantage: racial segregation, poverty, violent crime, high rates of incarceration and dismal health statistics. For more than a decade, the Urban Institute (Ul) has worked closely with the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA), residents of DCHA public housing communities, and similar high-poverty urban communities across the nation to develop and improve outcomes and reduce disparities via improvements to health and social services and structures. As a result of concerns voiced by DCHA residents across multiple housing communities, DCHA approached Ul two years ago to assist them in addressing what they described as ""the problems with our girls."" Based on DCHA and resident recommendations, Ul reached out to resident leaders from Benning Terrace, a high-poverty, African American public housing community which has the highest crime rate and is the most underserved, located in the Districts' Ward 7. A preliminary needs assessment jointly conducted by Ul, DCHA and public housing residents identified a group of related adolescent sexual health concerns - sexual violence and coercion, teen pregnancy and HIV/STI. The current application includes the strengthening of this ongoing collaboration of the DCHA, African American residents (adults and adolescents) of Benning Terrace, community-based health, social service and faith-based organizations, Ul and university-based health disparities researchers to reduce adolescent sexual health disparities. Sexual assault and coercion, pregnancy, and HIV/STI are all significantly over-represented among African Americans in DC; HIV rates are the highest in the nation, with up to 12% of women infected. The proposed three-year CBPR process includes 1) a community-driven needs assessment; 2) an asset mapping process regarding resources and expertise available for inclusion in a sustainable intervention; 3) development of program and evaluation models; and 4) piloting to assess program feasibility, acceptability, perceived efficacy and outcomes.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): Adverse sexual health outcomes (i.e., sexual coercion, pregnancy, and HIV/STIs) are significantly over-represented by African American adolescents, and reach their highest levels in high-poverty neighborhoods. In public housing communities, the use of CBPR to develop interventions targeting adolescents and their parents is a unique approach toward reducing adolescent sexual health disparities.

"Project LOVE: Preventing Adolescent Dating Violence among Rural African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent dating violence (ADV) continues to be a major public health problem. The need to address and prevent ADV has received notable attention in recent years. Although it has been documented that ADV occurs at an alarming rate among teens from all backgrounds, there are particular disparities among those who are African American and live in rural communities. My NCMHD Disparities Research and Education Advancing Mission (DREAM) Career Transition Award (K22) is entitled: Project LOVE: Preventing Adolescent Dating Violence among Rural African Americans. As the name implies, the focus of the K22 is to gain additional training and research experience necessary to become an independent prevention researcher who can design, conduct and evaluate community-based intervention trials to prevent ADV among rural African Americans. My academic, clinical, teaching, and research experiences to date have prepared me to successfully enter my next phase of career development. I have received excellent preparation in the areas of mental health, ADV, community-based participatory research (CBPR), and qualitative research design and data analysis. This preparation occurred through my doctoral training in Counseling Psychology, Postdoctoral Fellowship in Public Health, W. K. Kellogg Health Scholars Fellowship in Health Disparities and CBPR, and current faculty position at GUMC. As a psychologist, I have had the opportunity to work clinically with a diverse group of clients. I have provided individual, couples, family, and group therapy. In regards to teaching, I have taught and/or co-taught numerous Psychology and Public Health courses. Some of the relevant courses are: adolescent mental health, counseling early adolescents, human development, cross cultural counseling, music therapy, CBPR, and health education. These courses in one way or another all relate to and/or have informed my research program. In addition to strong institutional support, the institutional environment in which I will complete the extramural phase of the K22 award (i.e., Georgetown University, Georgetown University Medical Center, Department of Psychiatry, and The Georgetown Center for Trauma and the Community) coupled with my community partners far exceed those necessary to carry out my proposed career development and research plans. Over the past six years, I have also engaged in multiple research projects aimed at eliminating health disparities. These projects have involved extensive community engagement and collaboration. My current and future research program is designed to use CBPR to decrease health disparities by preventing ADV among African American youth in rural settings. Two critical components of the research are: (a) an examination of social, ecological, and cultural factors that impact ADV, and (b) an examination of the association of ADV with both mental and sexual health. The proposed K22 research plan will build upon my previous research to enable the design and pilot testing of a community-based, culturally-appropriate, effective, and sustainable ADV prevention intervention for rural, African American youth. Thus, my K22 career development goals focus on the development of competence in: Goal 1: research skills focusing on quantitative methods and data analysis and grant writing; Goal 2: racial/ethnic and rural health disparities, which will inform the conceptualization, design and conduct of culturally and geographically appropriate research; Goal 3: the development and implementation of community-based interventions; and Goal 4: the design, conduct, and evaluation of community-based intervention trials. These goals will be accomplished through a comprehensive plan that includes mentoring, expert consultation, community partner collaboration, coursework, instructional programs, tutorials, conference attendance, presentations, publication writing, and teaching. The Project LOVE research plan will build upon previous research by further developing a community-academic partnership that will guide the design and evaluation of an ADV prevention intervention for rural African American adolescents. The following research question guides the study: How can CBPR be used to design and pilot test an ADV prevention intervention appropriate for rural African American adolescents? Our specific aims are: Aim #1: To further develop and evaluate the Project LOVE community-academic partnership and community advisory board. Successful completion of this aim will increase partnership research capacity; Aim #2: To design a culturally and geographically appropriate community-based ADV prevention intervention for rural African American adolescents aged 10-14; Aim #3: To assess the acceptability of the intervention through the use of focus group interviews; and Aim#4: To pilot test the intervention to evaluate the feasibility and of intervention design. My previous and current research, coupled with the proposed K22 career development and research plans will provide the knowledge and skills necessary to successfully design, conduct, and evaluate a community-based intervention trial, thereby marking my transition to independent investigator status.

"Mechanisms of Health Promotion in Diverse Youth Through Gay-Straight Alliances ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth face serious health risks that constitute costly public health concerns. There has been strong documentation of sexual orientation-based disparities on depression, anxiety, and substance use, all of which heighten risk for suicidal ideation and attempts. Further, racial/ethni minority LGBT youth contend with discrimination from multiple marginalized statuses and may face even greater health risks. Yet, there is also a paucity of research on this population. Professional organizations have emphasized the need to consider how social systems contribute to or mitigate health disparities among LGBT populations. Schools are a central access point for resources that may benefit LGBT youth. Few studies, however, have considered school-based programs that address sexual orientation-based health disparities. Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs) - school-based groups in which LGBT and heterosexual youth receive support and advocate for safer schools - have grown exponentially and serve many youth. Yet, they operate without empirically supported strategies. There are virtually no data on how GSA involvement attenuates negative health outcomes or whether youth from other marginalized backgrounds (e.g., racial/ethnic minority youth, either LGBT or heterosexual) derive benefits. There is a pressing need for data in order to develop effective GSA-based interventions and best practices in general. The current project addresses these gaps. This project is among the first to test how GSA involvement is associated with health outcomes through multiple pathways. It takes advantage of multi-informant data from youth and adults and utilizes quantitative and qualitative data. Data will be gathered from 400 GSA-involved youth (both LGBT and heterosexual) and their GSA advisors among a racially and ethnically diverse sample in 40 GSAs, interviews among 32-40 youth stratified across race/ethnicity, and from a nonmember comparison sample from the same schools. The first aim is to rigorously compare GSA members and nonmembers on health and school outcomes by comparing demographically and socially similar youth in the same school and controlling for confounders. The second aim is to capture variability among GSA members by testing mechanisms by which GSA involvement mitigates negative outcomes. The third aim is to identify race/ethnicity-specific GSA factors that mitigate negative outcomes particularly for racial/ethnic minority youth. Given the growing national presence of GSAs, this knowledge stands to benefit many youth by identifying critical factors underlying health promotion and by providing empirically-based recommendations for best practices to maximize GSA effectiveness. Results will provide a foundation for developing and systematically testing GSA-based interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research has the potential for high public health impact to address health concerns among youth from multiple minority groups, including LGBT and racial/ethnic minority youth. It focuses on the ways in which involvement in Gay-Straight Alliances - prominent school-based groups that provide support for these youth - reduces sexual orientation- and race/ethnicity-based health disparities on depression, anxiety, and substance use. This knowledge will be critical for improving health-related interventions among these youth populations.            ",Mechanisms of Health Promotion in Diverse Youth Through Gay-Straight Alliances,8962427,R01MD009458,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Survey Method ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Testing ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Rural ', ' Gays ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Attenuated ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' transsexual ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' informant ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' comparison group ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON COLLEGE,R01,2015,379583,0.014106005476114588
"Early Adversity Shapes Adolescent Risk Behavior Trajectories in Mexican Americans (Diversity Supplement) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over half a million people in the United States have died of AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic, and the number of people living with HIV infection is higher now than ever before. Currently, over 1 million adults and adolescents in the US are living with HIV. The majority of new HIV cases occur before age 25 and young Latinos are disproportionately affected. Compared to non-Latino white youths, Latino adolescents have 4 times the risk of HIV infection and, by young adulthood, more than 4 times the rate of AIDS diagnosis. Latinos are more likely to use substances in early adolescence and more likely to engage in unprotected sex than other ethnic groups, which increases their risk for HIV/AIDS. These disparities are persistent and represent a critical public health issue given the growing population of young Latinos in the US. Mexican Americans represent the largest subgroup of Latinos, yet longitudinal studies with Mexican American youth have been sparse due to a host of methodological barriers. The proposed longitudinal research resolves these issues to address important scientific gaps. By building on a rich, well-established, long-term cohort of Mexican American children and their parents, this project aims to understand whether and how adversity exposure in early life contributes to the emergence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence. Towards this aim, we will gather detailed information on substance use and sexual risk-taking at ages 14y and 15.5y, when adolescents are sustaining the major social and biological transitions of the pubertal period. The strong study design builds on: (1) rich adversit data already collected during pregnancy and throughout childhood for this established cohort of Mexican American youth and their parents, combined with new equally rich data collection proposed in adolescence; (2) impressive participant retention to date in this hard-to-reach population; (3) ongoing assessing of puberty using leading-edge clinic-based methods obtained at multiple points in time; (4) the inclusion of new measures of stress responsively and pubertal hormones to better understand underlying bio physiological processes; and (5) the inclusion of key protective factors, including parental influences and cultural factors, that may buffer against risk for adolescent problem behaviors. Results from this project will yield important information about the emergence of substance use and sexual risk-taking within this highly vulnerable group. By focusing on potentially modifiable characteristics, this research has the potential to elucidate distinct areas to target for intervention to prevent risk-taking behaviors in adolescence and thereby reduce risk for HIV/AIDS and other STIs over the life course. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is increasing recognition that early life events influence long-term health and health disparities. The design of this study allows us to longitudinally examine the effects of early adversity on the emergence of substance use and risky sexual behaviors among Mexican American adolescents, as well as key factors that may mediate or moderate these effects. This research aims to elucidate targets for intervention to prevent risk- taking behaviors in adolescence and thereby reduce risk for HIV/AIDS and other STIs over the life course.",Early Adversity

"Daily Experience in Adolescence and Biomarkers of Early Risk for Adult Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite calls for the identification of early risk factors for the development of chronic health conditions, there has been little longitudinal research on biomarkers of health that has been conducted in persons younger than 25 years of age. In addition, there is only a minimal understanding of how biological indices of early risk for adult health develop among adolescents with Latin American and Asian backgrounds, the two fastest rising ethnic groups in the United States, who are at differential risk for adverse health outcomes as compared to European Americans. An understanding of these processes is necessary for the development of ethnically and culturally relevant prevention efforts.  We propose a 3-wave longitudinal study of adolescents and their caregivers from Mexican, Chinese and European backgrounds in order to assess the impact of daily experience on biological indicators of early risk for adult health. Our focus on daily experience stems from the need to identify the mechanisms by which global social factors identified in demographic surveys, such as lower education and income, play themselves out in individuals' daily lives. Daily experiences such as social conflict, excessive demands, emotional distress, threat, and sleep behaviors have been shown to be linked to both global risk factors and multiple biological indices of health risk among adults.  The project will include both intensive behavioral assessments and detailed biological markers of health risk from both adolescents and their parents in order to address the following specific aims: (1) describe the development during adolescence of biological indices of early risk for adult health; (2) assess the role of daily experience in the development of early health risk; (3) examine the existence of ethnic disparities in early health risk; and (4) explore the role of potential protective factors in the development of early health risk.  Approximately 540 pairs of adolescents and primary caregivers (180 from each ethnic group) will be assessed when the adolescents are approximately 15-16, 17-18, and 19-20 years of age. Each year, both adolescents and caregivers will participate in interviews that include measures of global social factors such as socioeconomic background and potential protective factors such as social connectedness. Participants will report daily experiences using a nightly diary checklist for 9 consecutive days. Salivary cortisol will be obtained at 4 time points each day for 4 of these days in order to analyze HPA activity, and participants will wear wrist actigraphs for the same 4 days to measure objective sleep behaviors. Blood pressure, BMI, and waist/hip ratio will be assessed, and dried blood spots will be obtained for the assessment of c-reactive-protein (CRP), cholesterol, and high density lipoproteins (HDL). Finally, peripheral blood samples will be provided by a subsample of 120 families for the assessment of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and for gene expression analyses of molecular signaling pathways driving inflammatory biology.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is only a minimal understanding of how biological indices of early risk for adult health develop among adolescents with Latin American and Asian backgrounds, the two fastest rising ethnic groups in the United States, who are at differential risk for adverse health outcomes as compared to European American. More in-depth examinations of the daily lives of adolescents from these populations could identify both the sources of these disparities as well as unique risk and protective factors. An understanding of these processes is necessary for the development of ethnically and culturally relevant prevention efforts.

"Community Violence and Reproductive Health among Youth in Salinas, California DESCRIPTION: The objective of this study, led by an early-stage investigator building directly on her NICHD K01 research, is to address gaps in research on structural and interpersonal factors in a rural, agricultural community that influence the onset of youth violence and sexual health risks associated with teen pregnancy during the transition from early to middle adolescence. In California, where one in eight U.S. adolescents reside; Latinas maintain the highest teen birth rate, accounting, in 2010, for 41% of the teen population yet 73% of teen births. Adolescent sexual health research has focused primarily on urban youth; however, one in three California teen births are to Latina teens residing in a rural county. Numerous structural and interpersonal (family, peer, partner) factors that shape the risk environment differ between urban and rural communities. Understanding these underlying contexts that contribute to health disparities is vital to achieving substantive improvements in health outcomes. Our NIH-funded research with Latino adolescents in San Francisco over the past 12 years has highlighted a strong connection between community violence and unintended teen pregnancy. Though traditionally regarded as urban, gangs have emerged in many nonurban areas of the United States. This study will take place in Salinas, CA, an agricultural community located in Monterey County on California's central coast. The U.S. Department of Justice named Salinas as one of six high-risk communities nationally for youth gang violence. Monterey County had the sixth highest teen birth rate in 2010 among California's 58 counties. High rates of youth violence and early childbearing in Salinas, California, coupled with entrenched socioeconomic disparities resulting from generations of Mexican migration for agricultural-sector employment, make research to develop appropriate interventions imperative. This context presents an opportunity to examine the relative salience of structural and interpersonal factors to youth violence and reproductive health in a rural county like numerous others throughout central California. This research was initiated by the Monterey County Health Department and has been developed in partnership with an experienced team of NIH investigators. Informed by the Social Ecological Model of Health, we will accomplish our aims through a mixed-methods design that includes formative qualitative research using focus groups, followed by a 2-year prospective cohort study with a random sample of 600 8th grade students, 40 of whom will be selected to complete prospective in-depth interviews. Our aims are to 1) investigate structural and interpersonal factors that are individually and jointly associated with engagement in violent behaviors and sexual health risks among female and male 8th-grade Latino students in Salinas, CA; 2) examine the trajectories of violent behaviors and sexual risk over time, and their interaction, during the transition from 8th grade to 10th grade; and 3) identify structural and interpersonal factors that influence engagement in violent behaviors and sexual health risks during the transition from 8th grade to 10th grade.

"Engendering Healthy Masculinities to Prevent Sexual Violence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Global health organizations highlight engaging men and boys in preventing violence against women as a potentially impactful public health strategy. A ""gender transformative"" approach involves altering gender and sexuality norms that foster violence against women while promoting bystander intervention (i.e., giving boys skills to interrupt abusive behaviors they witness among peers) to reduce the perpetration of sexual violence (SV) and adolescent relationship abuse (ARA). This study will test, via a two arm cluster randomized controlled trial, a ""gender transformative"" SV/ARA perpetration prevention program titled ""Boys Care"" implemented in a community-based setting among African American adolescent males ages 14-17. This is a stakeholder- engaged intervention that involves an 18 hour curriculum divided into 3 weekend day sessions delivered over a 2 month period (at 4 week intervals) in community-based youth-serving agencies (YMCA and Urban League). Control sites will implement an evidence-based life skills curriculum. The rationale for focusing on primarily African American youth in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods is two-fold. First, racial/ethnic disparities in health are stark in Pittsburgh, the setting for this study; prevention efforts in communities with high prevalence of poverty, sexual violence, and poor health outcomes are needed. Second, the prevention educators are from these communities and have high degrees of trust and respect fundamental to building positive youth relationships. Innovations are: first, an intersectional approach combining gender theory, adolescent sexual development, and community-partnered research to evaluate the impact of gender transformative programming on SV/ARA perpetration in socially disadvantaged communities; second, a program that integrates education and skills building around gender norms change with sexuality education theorized to target SV perpetration and increase healthy sexual behaviors; third, a stakeholder-engaged approach in design and implementation to ensure local relevance, feasibility, and replicability; and fourth, use of arts-based strategies to encourage youth to explore masculinities. Via a 2-arm cluster-randomized trial in youth-serving agencies (10 clusters, N=960 adolescent males ages 14-17), this study will assess the effectiveness of ""Boys Care"" compared to a life skills curriculum. At the end of the 2 month program (Time 2), compared to controls, youth will demonstrate increased positive bystander intervention behaviors (secondary outcome). Intermediate outcomes are: increased condom and contraceptive self-efficacy; increased recognition of abusive behaviors; increased gender-equitable attitudes; and increased intentions to intervene with peers. Six months after the intervention (Time 3), youth will report less perpetration of SV and ARA toward females (Primary Outcome) compared to controls. This study will provide urgently needed information about the effectiveness of a gender transformative program that combines healthy sexuality skills, gender norms change, and bystander skills to interrupt peers' disrespectful and harmful behaviors to reduce SV/ARA perpetration among adolescent males. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Global health organizations highlight engaging men and boys in preventing violence against women as a potentially impactful public health strategy. A ""gender transformative"" approach involves theory- and evidence- based practices to alter gender and sexuality norms that foster violence against women while promoting bystander intervention (i.e., giving boys skills to interrupt abusive behaviors they witness among peers) to reduce the perpetration of sexual violence (SV) and adolescent relationship abuse (ARA).

"Gender, Autonomy, and Contraceptive Use Among Young People     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career Goals: This is an application for a K01 Career Development Award in Population Research for Ushma Upadhyay, PhD, MPH, a Public Health Social Scientist at the University of California, San Francisco. Her preliminary research focuses on contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy, and includes the development of the first measure of reproductive autonomy, assessing a woman's power to decide about and control matters related to contraceptive use, pregnancy and childbearing. In the short term, she aims to build on this work, investigating the effect of gender-based power on contraceptive use among young people. In the long term, she aspires to conduct research that results in evidence-based interventions that help young people to control their fertility. The knowledge and experience she will gain from the K01 award will prepare her to compete for NICHD R01 funding to design a randomized intervention trial to test the effects of a gender-based power intervention on contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy among adolescents and young people. Environment: The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) provides generous support for junior faculty. UCSF researchers have a long history of pursuing innovative ideas in reproductive health. As an institution, it has been unequivocally supportive of research on contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy. Key Elements of Research Career Development Plan: Dr. Upadhyay has a rich background in epidemiologic and demographic methods, with substantial experience analyzing large datasets. This career development award will enable her to address several remaining gaps in her training specific to her career goals, and to gain applied experience planning and executing a primary data collection study on gender-based power and contraceptive use. Her training goals are to gain experience and expertise in sociological theories of gender among adolescents, qualitative research, advanced quantitative methods, and translating evidence into intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Upadhyay has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team. It includes a Primary Mentor, Tina Raine-Bennett, MD, MPH, a clinician scientist formerly at UCSF who is now Research Director of the Women's Health Research Institute at Kaiser Permanente specializing in adolescent unintended pregnancy and racial disparities, and co-mentor Shari Dworkin, PhD, MS, a medical sociologist in UCSF's Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences and an expert on gender- based power. Her team includes three additional, complementary advisors: Diana Foster, PhD, a demographer in UCSF's Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, who studies the consequences of unintended pregnancy; Torsten B. Neilands, PhD, a quantitative methodologist at UCSF's Center for AIDS Prevention Studies with expertise in latent variable (structural equation) modeling; and Claire Brindis, DrPH, Professor of Pediatrics and Health Policy whose research focuses on adolescent and child health policy, adolescent pregnancy and pregnancy prevention, and adolescent health and risk-taking behaviors. Dr. Upadhyay's training will include a combination of structured reading lists and tutorials with mentors, coursework, self-directed learning, conference presentations and attendance, and seminars. Description of the Research Project: Unintended pregnancy is an important public health problem; half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. The transition to adulthood is a particularly vulnerable period for unintended pregnancy; women ages 15 to 24 are at highest risk. One of the main reasons for unintended pregnancy is lack of consistent contraceptive use. The overall objective of this study is to conduct mentored research that examines the pathways between power, gender norms, and masculinities and contraceptive use among young people ages 15 to 24. My main hypothesis is that adherence to gender norms and traditional norms of masculinity lead to inconsistent and non-use of contraceptives. This research will assess this hypothesis through three specific aims. Aim 1 is to explore the role that relationship power, gender norms, and masculinities have in influencing adolescent and young people's contraceptive use. This aim involves qualitative in-depth interviews with adolescent and young women, men, and couples. Aim 2 is to adapt and validate existing instruments that measure relationship power, gender norms, and masculinities so that they are appropriate for adolescents and young people. This aim involves adapting my own Reproductive Autonomy Scale, the Gender Relations Scale, and the Masculinity Ideology in Relationships Scale for use among adolescents and young men and women. Aim 3 is to determine how relationship power, gender norms, and masculinities impact adolescent and young people's contraceptive use through a 3-month pilot prospective study at an adolescent family planning clinic. Examining gender-based power from the perspectives of multiple disciplines using mixed-methods, I expect to make important contributions in three areas: 1) theory on gender and power and contraceptive use, 2) measurement of gender-based power among adolescents, and 3) potential interventions that reduce unintended pregnancy. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare me for the successful submission of an R01 application to test an adolescent contraceptive use intervention and a research career in gender and power-related determinants of adolescent reproductive health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the United States, over 1.7 million young women ages 15 to 24 have an unintended pregnancy each year, leading to a range of negative health outcomes. The knowledge gained from this study will be used to guide potential interventions to reduce disparities in unintended pregnancy and help achieve the Healthy People 2020 goal of reducing the adolescent pregnancy rate by 10%.            ","Gender, Autonomy, and Contraceptive Use Among Young People",8925702,K01HD077064,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' California ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Contraceptives ', ' Contraceptive Agents ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographer ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Fathers ', ' Female ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fertility ', ' Goals ', ' Gynecology ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' role men ', ' male role ', "" Men's Role "", "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Pregnancy Rate ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Reading ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' sociologist ', ' Solutions ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Gender Relations ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Clinic ', ' Equation ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Contraception ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' social ', ' reproductive ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Population Research ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Cognitive ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pregnancy prevention ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' child bearing ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' young man ', ' young woman ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2015,144270,0.08132046449870284
"The Role of Place on the Co-occurrence of ATOD Use and Violence Among Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Mentored Scientist Career Development Award (K01) that provides me the training and research experience necessary to develop an innovative research program focused on ATOD use and violent/aggressive behavior among youth. My research and professional career have focused on vulnerable populations of young people living in communities characterized by substantial health and social disparities. My primary research interest focuses on resiliency in the prevention of ATOD use and violent behavior among at-risk urban adolescents and young adults. This research interest stems from my experience as a Nurse Practitioner in school-based and community-based clinics with adolescents and young adults. To date, my program of research has focused on the healthy development of adolescents and prevention of risk behaviors, particularly youth violence. My long-term goal is to become an independent investigator in the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violent/aggressive behavior among youth, and the role of primitive factors in the healthy development of youth, specifically primitive factors within the neighborhood context (place). With my long- term goal in mind, my training and research objectives for the five-year award period are: 1) To develop expertise in ATOD use, the relationship between ATOD use and violent behavior, and their concomitant individual and neighborhood risk and primitive factors; 2) To expand my quantitative skills to examine for the effect of place (neighborhood) on adolescent ATOD use and the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence/aggression overtime; 3) To develop skills in intervention development, evaluation, and design; and 4) To advance my knowledge of the ethical conduct of intervention research with adolescents, including considerations regarding recruitment, data collection, management and security, and intervention. Training will include: graduate coursework in spatial-temporal analysis; short courses in intervention development and design and advanced multilevel modeling; mentored literature reviews on youth ATOD use, ATOD use and violence, and neighborhood effects of substance use among youth; participation in substance use interdisciplinary workgroups and meetings; mentorship in developing school and community partnerships for intervention research and translating research findings into interventions; and three mentored research projects. I will be mentored by experts in adolescent development, adolescent substance use, spatial analysis, and intervention development and implementation. Guided by a developmental-ecological perspective, I have proposed two secondary data analysis projects and one data collection project to address the following overarching research aims: 1) To examine the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence/aggression among urban youth; 2) To explore how place influences the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence; 3) To examine the relationship between future orientation, place, and the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence during adolescence; and 4) To develop an intervention and relevant measures that will be the basis for an R21 and future RCT R01. Using data from the NIDA-funded longitudinal Flint Adolescent Study (n = 850, PI: Zimmerman), the first project will focus on the trajectories of ATOD use and violent behavior over time, and will identify neighborhood characteristics that influence trajectories of ATOD use and violent behavior in a sample of urban youth. I will use dual trajectory growth curve analysis and cross-legged path analyses to explore the relationship between ATOD use and violence from age 14-32. Multilevel modeling analyses will be used to identify neighborhood characteristics that influence the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence. Using data from a county-wide school based survey (Coordinated Community Student Survey; C2S2); the second research project will focus on the relationship between future orientation, place, and the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violent behavior. I will use multi-group, multilevel SEM (ML-SEM) to examine differences in the relationship between future orientation and ATOD use/violent behavior based on neighborhood factors. The third study involves conducting a survey with a subsample of C2S2 youth (n = 500 6th grade students) for a more in-depth exploration of the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violent behavior, future orientation and its relationship to ATOD and violent behavior, and how place influence future orientation and ATOD use and violent behavior in a sample of urban youth. Measures, study design, and analyses will be determined based on knowledge, skills, and mentoring received as part of the training plan. In research projects 2 and 3, I will use spatial analytic techniques to examine the effects of place-based risk and primitive factors on future orientation, youth ATOD use and violence. In the proposed projects, I seek to identify place-based assets and resources that are associated with preventing the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence and promote the development of future orientation. In collaboration with school/community partners, I will use these findings to develop an intervention focused on promoting health youth development and reducing ATOD use and violent behavior during year 4, and I will submit an R21 to test this intervention during year 5. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug use and violent behavior can place youth at risk for not completing the developmental tasks of adolescence and limits their transition into healthy productive adults. NIDA and others have recognized the importance of primary prevention strategies to prevent adolescent drug use. The proposed research investigates the relationship between neighborhood and individual-level risk and protective factors and the co- occurrence of ATOD use and violent behavior. The research findings will inform the development of an intervention to prevent ATOD use and violent behavior. The research project will be embedded in a comprehensive training program design to help me strength and develop new research skills under the direction of a strong mentorship team.",The Role of Place on the Co-occurrence of ATOD Use and Violence Among Youth,8786881,K01DA034765,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Adolescent Behavior ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Homicide ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nurse Practitioners ', ' Play ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' spatial perception ', ' spatial orientation (perception) ', ' spatial orientation ', ' perceptual spatial orientation ', ' Spatial Discrimination ', ' Space Perception ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Review Literature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Security ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' 6th grade ', ' sixth grade ', ' youth drug use ', ' adolescent drug use ', ' youth substance use ', ' adolescent substance use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' teen violence ', ' youth violence ', ' social disparities ', ' Mind ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' stem ', ' spatial relationship ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' ATOD ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2015,140200,0.06503521896284324
"Role of 3D Weight Progression Software in Weight Counseling to Decrease Weight-related Health Disparities Among Adolescent African-American Females ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood and adolescent obesity is a growing epidemic in the United States, especially among minorities. Research has repeatedly shown that African-American youth are disproportionately affected by the obesity epidemic, especially African-American girls. By 2007-08, almost 30 percent of black girls were obese, the highest prevalence of any age group by gender, race or ethnicity. With statistics indicating that 50% of obese children become obese adults, related illness treatments are projected to cost close to $147 billion. For these reasons, it is imperative that health care providers, parents, and adolescent patients effectively communicate with each another in regards to the child's weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) trajectories. The only tools currently available are weight and BMI percentile charts, which require both an acceptance of these population standards and a certain level of health literacy and numeracy which make their use very limiting. This proposal describes a useful method for not only explaining growth trends and but also monitoring weight in a busy clinical practice. It has the potential to significantly decrease the disparity observed n the obesity epidemic as well as to improve weight management counseling in and outside of the clinical setting by facilitating better knowledge sharing and improved comprehension of weight trends, health behaviors, and their impact on adolescence health. A low-cost software application is proposed to equip providers with the ability to immediately demonstrate prediction of future weight gain and provide a better understanding of how personal behaviors directly result in changes in weight and BMI change. The SBIR Phase I will investigate the technical merit and feasibility of the software application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood and adolescent obesity, especially among minorities, is a mounting problem. The technology described in this proposal will fill a gap in current obesity management practices and has the potential to significantly impact the incidence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents, especially those disproportionately affected by the obesity epidemic. The improved usefulness of this tool, especially compared to standard growth charts, will be enjoyed by health providers, parents, and patients and will significantly assist in curbing the obesity epidemic.                ",Role of 3D Weight Progression Software in Weight Counseling to Decrease Weight-related Health Disparities Among Adolescent African-American Females,9000873,R43MD010544,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Counseling ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Measuring Daily Experiences of Racial Discrimination in African American Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans' experiences with racial discrimination have been implicated in several types of mental and physical health pathology during the adolescent period, including substance use, psychological symptoms, and externalizing behaviors. These problems not only disrupt normative developmental processes during adolescence, but also contribute to race-based health disparities in adulthood for African Americans. However, methodological problems related to measurement of the timing, context, and content of racial discrimination experiences substantially limit the ability to understand the role of racial discrimination in the daily lives and overall health of African American youth. In order to improve measurement and to promote synergy between theory and psychometric instrumentation, this grant will develop and validate a quantitative measure of experienced racial discrimination for use in longitudinal substance use and public health research with African American adolescents. This measure will improve the current state of racial discrimination research with African American adolescents by: 1) utilizing daily diary measurement to minimize retrospective bias; 2) including an array of contexts common in the lives of African American adolescents (e.g., school, internet, athletics); and 3) incorporating a mixed-method approach to validating the content of the measure. In this way, the proposed research project will take an innovative multidimensional, comprehensive, and mixed-method approach to developing a daily measure of experienced racial discrimination for use with African American adolescents.  The ultimate goal of the current research and training fellowship application is to prepare the applicant to become an independent researcher with expertise in the field of experienced racial discrimination and health disparities for African American youth. The specific goals of this fellowship are: 1) to expand the applicant's knowledge of the experience of racial discrimination for African American adolescents; 2) to increase the applicant's skills in psychometric measure development; and 3) to educate the applicant in advanced quantitative analysis. The applicant will achieve these goals by engaging in multidisciplinary coursework, professional collaboration and mentorship, and research conferences and publications. These activities will enable the applicant to execute his fellowship and dissertation research aims of developing, validating, and disseminating a measure of experienced racial discrimination for use in daily, longitudinal substance use and public health research with African American adolescents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American adolescents' experience of racial discrimination is linked to substance use, depression, and a myriad of other health problems that persist into adulthood. However, weaknesses in current measurement limit the understanding of the frequency, types, and health consequences of racial discrimination for these youth, making it difficult to design and evaluate culturally-relevant and developmentally-appropriate interventions. The goal of this fellowship is to prepare the applicant to become an interdisciplinary researcher with expertise in the measurement of experienced racial discrimination who can contribute to the reduction of African American adolescent mental and physical health disparities linked to racial discrimination. !",Measuring Daily Experiences of Racial Discrimination in African American Youth,8896691,F31DA036288,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Stone ', ' Biliary or Urinary Stones ', ' Calculi ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' instrumentation ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pathology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Formulation ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' skills ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Athletic ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health research ', ' ']",NIDA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,43120,0.02048687998424059
"Predicting Suicide Risk in Sexual Minority and Nonminority Youth: Associations Among Neural Sensitivity to Social Rejection, Peer Rejection, and Suicidality ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a need for research that can help better predict risk and prevent suicide among adolescent youth. Rates of suicidality, a strong predictor of suicide, are higher among adolescent girls compared to boys, and highest among sexual minority girls (girls who endorse same-sex romantic attraction, behavior or identity). This study tests an innovative model of suicide risk in a sample of sexual minority and nonminority adolescent girls that integrates neurobehavioral and interpersonal vulnerabilities. Specifically, the model posits that neural sensitivity to social rejection, when occurring in the presence of peer rejection, increases risk for suicide. This proposed K01 bridges the candidate's prior training in interpersonal risk for depression and developmental psychopathology, with new training in affective neuroscience and suicide risk. This training will uniquely position the candidate to investigate the development of negative valence systems, with an emphasis on affective sensitivity to social rejection, and associations with suicidality. Thus, the proposed study will be the first in a larger program of research that will contribute to NIMH research priorities, such as Strategic Objective 2, by investigating how individual differences in biologic and social/environmental factors contribute to heterogeneity in the development of suicide risk in diverse populations. Specifically, the candidate plans to follow the proposed study with larger longitudinal studies using multiple methods and repeated assessments of neurobehavioral and interpersonal vulnerability for suicide during the adolescent developmental period to examine 1) how pain related neural circuitry underlying affective sensitivity to social rejection may be associated with suicide risk, and 2) interpersonal factors (e.g., interpersonal rejection) that may contribute to and strengthen sensitivity to social rejection over time within the context of social and pubertal changes in adolescence. The candidate will also be positioned to investigate etiological models explaining elevated suicide risk among sexual minority youth. This program of research is expected to advance the field by improving the ability to predict risk for suicide among vulnerable youth, and to identify targets for intervention during optimal developmental windows.  To achieve these career objectives, the candidate will receive training in developmental affective neuroscience, neuroimaging methods, and theory and research on development of suicide risk in adolescence, including sexual minority youth. She has an ideal mentorship team within an optimal scientific training environment to provide the requisite training for her to meet her career goals. Dr. Jennifer Silk is an expert on development of social-emotional processing from childhood into adolescence. Dr. Mary Phillips has significant expertise in affective neuroscience and fMRI methods, and neural underpinnings of emotional reactivity and regulation. Dr. Michael Marshal provides expertise on suicidality disparities between sexual minority and nonminority youth. Additional mentorship and support from consultants will provide training in the role of pain neural circuitry underlying the affective experience of social rejection (i.e. ""social pain"", Dr. Naomi Eisenberger), and the development of suicide risk in adolescents (Dr. David Brent) and new methods to assess suicide risk (Dr. Matt Nock).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents in the U.S., and suicide rates increase markedly during the transition from childhood to adolescence. The study will be the first in a larger program of research designed to investigate how the RDoC domain for negative valence systems is linked to suicide by investigating how aspects of the physical pain system involved in affective responses to social rejection and loss may influence risk for suicide, and how exposure to rejection experiences may amplify risk for suicide among vulnerable youth. Knowledge gained from this research will inform 1) what interventions should be used for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, such as the potential use of neuromodulatory interventions currently used to treat physical pain conditions, 2) who is in need of these interventions, such as youth with heightened affective sensitivity to social rejection, and 3) when to use these interventions, such as after social rejection experiences during the adolescent developmental period.            ","Predicting Suicide Risk in Sexual Minority and Nonminority Youth: Associations Among Neural Sensitivity to Social Rejection, Peer Rejection, and Suicidality",9083084,K01MH109850,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cause of Death ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Interview ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Social Development ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' somesthetic sensory cortex ', ' Somatosensory Cortex ', ' Stress ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Silk ', ' Friends ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' career ', ' Friendships ', ' improved ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' Marshal ', ' meetings ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' neuroregulation ', ' social separation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' emotional distress ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' peer victimization ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' neural model ', ' Affective ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' sexual minority ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Negative Valence ', ' Same-sex ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2016,159885,0.00619708328218947
"The Role of Place on the Co-occurrence of ATOD Use and Violence Among Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Mentored Scientist Career Development Award (K01) that provides me the training and research experience necessary to develop an innovative research program focused on ATOD use and violent/aggressive behavior among youth. My research and professional career have focused on vulnerable populations of young people living in communities characterized by substantial health and social disparities. My primary research interest focuses on resiliency in the prevention of ATOD use and violent behavior among at-risk urban adolescents and young adults. This research interest stems from my experience as a Nurse Practitioner in school-based and community-based clinics with adolescents and young adults. To date, my program of research has focused on the healthy development of adolescents and prevention of risk behaviors, particularly youth violence. My long-term goal is to become an independent investigator in the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violent/aggressive behavior among youth, and the role of primitive factors in the healthy development of youth, specifically primitive factors within the neighborhood context (place). With my long- term goal in mind, my training and research objectives for the five-year award period are: 1) To develop expertise in ATOD use, the relationship between ATOD use and violent behavior, and their concomitant individual and neighborhood risk and primitive factors; 2) To expand my quantitative skills to examine for the effect of place (neighborhood) on adolescent ATOD use and the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence/aggression overtime; 3) To develop skills in intervention development, evaluation, and design; and 4) To advance my knowledge of the ethical conduct of intervention research with adolescents, including considerations regarding recruitment, data collection, management and security, and intervention. Training will include: graduate coursework in spatial-temporal analysis; short courses in intervention development and design and advanced multilevel modeling; mentored literature reviews on youth ATOD use, ATOD use and violence, and neighborhood effects of substance use among youth; participation in substance use interdisciplinary workgroups and meetings; mentorship in developing school and community partnerships for intervention research and translating research findings into interventions; and three mentored research projects. I will be mentored by experts in adolescent development, adolescent substance use, spatial analysis, and intervention development and implementation. Guided by a developmental-ecological perspective, I have proposed two secondary data analysis projects and one data collection project to address the following overarching research aims: 1) To examine the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence/aggression among urban youth; 2) To explore how place influences the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence; 3) To examine the relationship between future orientation, place, and the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence during adolescence; and 4) To develop an intervention and relevant measures that will be the basis for an R21 and future RCT R01. Using data from the NIDA-funded longitudinal Flint Adolescent Study (n = 850, PI: Zimmerman), the first project will focus on the trajectories of ATOD use and violent behavior over time, and will identify neighborhood characteristics that influence trajectories of ATOD use and violent behavior in a sample of urban youth. I will use dual trajectory growth curve analysis and cross-legged path analyses to explore the relationship between ATOD use and violence from age 14-32. Multilevel modeling analyses will be used to identify neighborhood characteristics that influence the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence. Using data from a county-wide school based survey (Coordinated Community Student Survey; C2S2); the second research project will focus on the relationship between future orientation, place, and the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violent behavior. I will use multi-group, multilevel SEM (ML-SEM) to examine differences in the relationship between future orientation and ATOD use/violent behavior based on neighborhood factors. The third study involves conducting a survey with a subsample of C2S2 youth (n = 500 6th grade students) for a more in-depth exploration of the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violent behavior, future orientation and its relationship to ATOD and violent behavior, and how place influence future orientation and ATOD use and violent behavior in a sample of urban youth. Measures, study design, and analyses will be determined based on knowledge, skills, and mentoring received as part of the training plan. In research projects 2 and 3, I will use spatial analytic techniques to examine the effects of place-based risk and primitive factors on future orientation, youth ATOD use and violence. In the proposed projects, I seek to identify place-based assets and resources that are associated with preventing the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence and promote the development of future orientation. In collaboration with school/community partners, I will use these findings to develop an intervention focused on promoting health youth development and reducing ATOD use and violent behavior during year 4, and I will submit an R21 to test this intervention during year 5. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug use and violent behavior can place youth at risk for not completing the developmental tasks of adolescence and limits their transition into healthy productive adults. NIDA and others have recognized the importance of primary prevention strategies to prevent adolescent drug use.

"Preventing IPV and Reproductive Coercion Among Underserved Adolescents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the candidate with training and research experiences that will promote her development as an independent clinician-researcher, with particular emphasis in the field of healthcare-based intervention research addressing gender-based violence, specifically reproductive coercion (RC), among medically underserved female adolescents in Mexico. This training will provide her with the opportunity to develop knowledge and skills in: 1) reproductive coercion (RC) epidemiology, assessment and prevention; 2) acquire knowledge in the theory, development, implementation, and adaptation of theoretically driven clinic-based behavioral interventions to reduce RC; 3) Acquire skills in multilevel modeling of longitudinal data to assess the efficacy of clinic-based behavioral interventions. Training activities will include didactic coursework and specific workshops, directed readings and one-on-one tutorials with mentors, and instruction in the responsible conduct of research. The candidate will receive mentorship from a Training Committee comprised of globally renowned experts in the fields of gender-based violence, reproductive coercion, adolescent health, healthcare-based screening and brief interventions for RC and epidemiology research. The present K23 research project emerges from the existing research infrastructure of Drs. Silverman and Miller's ARCHES (Addressing Reproductive Coercion in Healthcare Settings) intervention, specific aims are to conduct secondary data analysis of the sub-sample of adolescents (16-20 years old) from ARCHES and 1) Conduct epidemiologic research to estimate the prevalence and correlates of RC among US female adolescents ages 16-20 (n=1311) from the ARCHES intervention; 2) Conduct multilevel longitudinal data analyses of the ARCHES adolescent sample to evaluate the effect of the intervention on RC among this group; 3) Conduct qualitative research to identify barriers to and adapt the ARCHES intervention to improve the reproductive autonomy of female adolescents in urban health clinics in Tijuana (Mexico); 4) Implement the adapted ARCHES intervention for female adolescents in urban health clinics in Tijuana, pilot test its feasibility and estimate effect sizes needed for future lrge-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT). While the specified initial goal of this work is a clinic-based intervention model adapted for adolescent health care in Mexico, the candidates' longer-term goal is to expand implementation of such programs throughout Latin America and in other low and middle-income countries.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reproductive Coercion (RC) has been associated with numerous negative effects on the physical, sexual, and mental health of young women and girls, with RC prevalence the highest among adolescents; 20% of adolescent family planning (FP) clients reporting such abuse. Findings from the proposed research will be critical to the adaptation, implementation, and evaluation of theoretically driven, empirically informed behavioral interventions that address RC among adolescents in a Latin-American country (Mexico) that can be further applied to other settings. In addition, the proposed project will allo the candidate to master a complex set of research skills in development and evaluation of theoretically driven clinic-based interventions, and develop topical expertise required to fully characterize and reduce the impact of RC, and potentially unintended pregnancies among underserved female adolescents in Mexico and other low and middle-income

"Treatment for Latino/a Adolescents with Suicidal Behavior DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching career goal of Yovanska Duarte-Velez, Assistant Research Scientist, at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras Campus (UPR-RP), is to become an independent mental health researcher in clinical interventions for suicidal adolescents and their families, with a specialization in Latino populations. One of her future objectives is to conduct multisite clinical trials of innovative treatments in Puerto Rico ad the United States. Her specific career goals are: 1) develop research skills to conduct randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in real world settings with high risk adolescents; 2) develop research skills to conduct cross-cultural and health disparity research in multisite studies; 3) gain knowledge of procedures to assess observable family variables and neurobehavioral and neurocognitive markers that may prove to be underlying mechanisms of change in treatment outcomes for suicidal adolescents and incorporate these measures in treatment research; and 4) improve knowledge of and gain experience with statistical analyses used in treatment research. These goals will be achieved through: 1) Drs. Spirito (RCT with suicidal adolescents) and Bernal's (Latino mental health) mentorship; 2) consultations with Drs. Canino (multisite & cross-cultural research), Alegria (health disparities & cross-cultural research), Goldston (intervention development), Stout (statistical methods) and Dickstein (neurobehavioral and neurocognitive mechanisms); 3) courses, seminars, workshops, and special training; and 4) execution of the proposed research project. The proposed award will be carried out at Brown University for the first two years and at UPR-RP for the last three years. The primary aim of the proposed research is to evaluate the feasibility of a socio-cognitive-behavioral therapy protocol for suicidal behavior (SCBT-SB protocol) with Latino/a adolescents. The Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) treatment protocol will include developmental and cultural factors in order to optimize treatment outcomes in suicidal Latino/a adolescents. Specifics aims are: 1) refine the treatment protocol to expand its applicability to Latino population in U.S. based on feedback from therapists working with Latino and suicidal adolescents in RI and on a small open trial; 2) develop and implement a training program for the protocol; and 3) conduct a pilot RCT of the SCBT-SB versus treatment as usual (TAU). This proposed project's public health significance is evident, as it addresses two Healthy People 2020 Objectives: MHMD HP2020-1: ""Reduce the suicide rate"" and MHMD HP-2: ""Reduce the rate of suicide attempts by adolescents."" Its clinical significance lies in the fact that there is little evidence of treatment efficacy for suicidal adolescents and there are evident disparities in the delivery of quality clinical services for Latio populations. Its scientific significance is that it tests the feasibility of a novel treatment apprach that aims to incorporate new perspectives relevant to Latino families and minority youth. It also addresses the third strategic objective of the NIMH, which is to: ""Develop new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illness."" PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Culturally sensitive treatment for suicidal minority youth and clinical investigators devoted to high suicide risk and underserved population are nearly absent. The proposed training grant allows Dr. Duarte-Velez to gain expertise in treatment development according to the needs and challenges faced by suicidal minority youths (e.g. ethnic, sexual) and their families. The primary aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the feasibility of a novel cognitive behavioral treatment protocol that integrates developmental and cultural factors to target suicidal behavior

"Gender, Autonomy, and Contraceptive Use Among Young People     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career Goals: This is an application for a K01 Career Development Award in Population Research for Ushma Upadhyay, PhD, MPH, a Public Health Social Scientist at the University of California, San Francisco. Her preliminary research focuses on contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy, and includes the development of the first measure of reproductive autonomy, assessing a woman's power to decide about and control matters related to contraceptive use, pregnancy and childbearing. In the short term, she aims to build on this work, investigating the effect of gender-based power on contraceptive use among young people. In the long term, she aspires to conduct research that results in evidence-based interventions that help young people to control their fertility. The knowledge and experience she will gain from the K01 award will prepare her to compete for NICHD R01 funding to design a randomized intervention trial to test the effects of a gender-based power intervention on contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy among adolescents and young people. Environment: The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) provides generous support for junior faculty. UCSF researchers have a long history of pursuing innovative ideas in reproductive health. As an institution, it has been unequivocally supportive of research on contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy. Key Elements of Research Career Development Plan: Dr. Upadhyay has a rich background in epidemiologic and demographic methods, with substantial experience analyzing large datasets. This career development award will enable her to address several remaining gaps in her training specific to her career goals, and to gain applied experience planning and executing a primary data collection study on gender-based power and contraceptive use. Her training goals are to gain experience and expertise in sociological theories of gender among adolescents, qualitative research, advanced quantitative methods, and translating evidence into intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Upadhyay has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team. It includes a Primary Mentor, Tina Raine-Bennett, MD, MPH, a clinician scientist formerly at UCSF who is now Research Director of the Women's Health Research Institute at Kaiser Permanente specializing in adolescent unintended pregnancy and racial disparities, and co-mentor Shari Dworkin, PhD, MS, a medical sociologist in UCSF's Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences and an expert on gender- based power. Her team includes three additional, complementary advisors: Diana Foster, PhD, a demographer in UCSF's Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, who studies the consequences of unintended pregnancy; Torsten B. Neilands, PhD, a quantitative methodologist at UCSF's Center for AIDS Prevention Studies with expertise in latent variable (structural equation) modeling; and Claire Brindis, DrPH, Professor of Pediatrics and Health Policy whose research focuses on adolescent and child health policy, adolescent pregnancy and pregnancy prevention, and adolescent health and risk-taking behaviors. Dr. Upadhyay's training will include a combination of structured reading lists and tutorials with mentors, coursework, self-directed learning, conference presentations and attendance, and seminars. Description of the Research Project: Unintended pregnancy is an important public health problem; half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. The transition to adulthood is a particularly vulnerable period for unintended pregnancy; women ages 15 to 24 are at highest risk. One of the main reasons for unintended pregnancy is lack of consistent contraceptive use. The overall objective of this study is to conduct mentored research that examines the pathways between power, gender norms, and masculinities and contraceptive use among young people ages 15 to 24. My main hypothesis is that adherence to gender norms and traditional norms of masculinity lead to inconsistent and non-use of contraceptives. This research will assess this hypothesis through three specific aims. Aim 1 is to explore the role that relationship power, gender norms, and masculinities have in influencing adolescent and young people's contraceptive use. This aim involves qualitative in-depth interviews with adolescent and young women, men, and couples. Aim 2 is to adapt and validate existing instruments that measure relationship power, gender norms, and masculinities so that they are appropriate for adolescents and young people. This aim involves adapting my own Reproductive Autonomy Scale, the Gender Relations Scale, and the Masculinity Ideology in Relationships Scale for use among adolescents and young men and women. Aim 3 is to determine how relationship power, gender norms, and masculinities impact adolescent and young people's contraceptive use through a 3-month pilot prospective study at an adolescent family planning clinic. Examining gender-based power from the perspectives of multiple disciplines using mixed-methods, I expect to make important contributions in three areas: 1) theory on gender and power and contraceptive use, 2) measurement of gender-based power among adolescents, and 3) potential interventions that reduce unintended pregnancy. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare me for the successful submission of an R01 application to test an adolescent contraceptive use intervention and a research career in gender and power-related determinants of adolescent reproductive health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the United States, over 1.7 million young women ages 15 to 24 have an unintended pregnancy each year, leading to a range of negative health outcomes. The knowledge gained from this study will be used to guide potential interventions to reduce disparities in unintended pregnancy and help achieve the Healthy People 2020 goal of reducing the adolescent pregnancy rate by 10%.            ","Gender, Autonomy, and Contraceptive Use Among Young People",9061426,K01HD077064,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age

"Social Ecology and the Prevention of Suicide and Aggression in African American Y DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This indicated prevention intervention trial employs a randomized controlled design to examine the efficacy of a 15-session, culturally tailored, cognitive-behavioral group prevention intervention for urban, low income African American adolescents. The PI successfully adapted the Coping with Stress Course (Clarke et al., 1995) to be culturally sensitive and appropriate for use with urban, low-income African American adolescents. This culturally-adapted intervention (i.e., the Adapted-Coping with Stress Course [Robinson & Case, 2003]) will be significantly revised to enhance individual competencies believed to mitigate the risk for self-directed (i.e., suicidality) and inter-personal aggression. n addition, the proposed study aims to examine how neighborhood and family ecological characteristics moderate the effects of a culturally-adapted, cognitive-behavioral coping with stress prevention intervention on African American adolescents' self-directed (i.e., suicidality) and interpersonal aggression.  This study is expected to have broad public health implications toward the reduction of African American youth health disparities and inform practice and policy on the development of effective violence prevention interventions for African American youth. It is expected that this study will inform a future large scale effectiveness study that will embed an evidence-based, culturally sensitive violence prevention intervention within a large urban school system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is transformative and will provide vital knowledge pertaining to the understanding and prevention of African American youth violence, both self-directed and interpersonal. In addition to examining the efficacy of a culturally sensive prevention intervention, the proposed study aims to examine how neighborhood and family ecological characteristics moderate the effects of the culturally-adapted, cognitive-behavioral coping with stress prevention intervention.

"Culturally-Specific HIV Prevention with Latino Adolescent Alcohol Abusers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 research and training award advances the long-term goal of reducing ethnic/racial health disparities in HIV/AIDS infection. The proposed training and research plans will enable the PI to develop the skills needed for an independent research career in this area of research. The objective of this application is to develop skills in HIV prevention research and the use of Community-Based Participatory Research and qualitative data collection methods to inform the development of an intervention which targets specific risk and protective factors associated with Hispanic adolescents' drinking and sexual risk taking behaviors. Data demonstrate that both sexual risk behaviors and alcohol use are prominent among Hispanic adolescents, and that the co- occurrence of these behaviors are directly associated with HIV/AIDS infection. Despite literature demonstrating the influence that intrapersonal factors, contextual factors, and culturally specific factors play in Hispanic adolescents' drinking and sexual risk taking behaviors, to date, no interventions addressing all three of these factors exists. This application addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a culturally specific HIV prevention intervention addressing risk and protective factors within these three domains to reduce Hispanic adolescents' risk of HIV infection. Specifically, the culturally specific intervention will include: 1) an adolescent Individual Motivational Interview (IMI) to address alcohol- and sex-related expectancies and attitudes, and alcohol refusal and safe sex behavioral intentions and self-efficacy; 2) a parent Motivational Interview to address parental monitoring and supervision and alcohol- and sex-related family communication; and, 3) an additional module designed to address acculturation conflicts between parents and adolescents, to restore the protective factors of familismo and respeto, and increase adolescents' ethnic identity and pride. A three-phase top-down research approach to adapt, refine, and pilot test the preventative intervention will be conducted. Phase I will include focus groups with Hispanic adolescents and parents and initial manual development. Phase II will include therapist training, an open pilot trial, qualitative exit interviews, and further manual revisions. Phase III will inclde a small-randomized clinical trial with 75 families recruited and randomly assigned to a culturally specific HIV prevention intervention, a standard HIV prevention intervention, or an assessment only condition. Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary indication of a reduction in HIV risk behavior and alcohol use will be examined at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. To enable the PI to pursue this long- term research agenda, she will work with experienced mentors to build four areas of expertise: (1) expertise in HIV prevention research; (2) expertise in the use of Community-Based Participatory Research methods; (3) skills for conducting qualitative research; and (4) skills in developing integrated alcohol and sexual risk interventions. This K01 addresses a key priority in HIV prevention science, and it will fully prepare the PI for an independent research career in the field. The long-term objectives of this application include 1) reducing and eliminating health disparities in HIV infection and alcohol use disorders among ethnic/racial groups, and 2) increasing access to care among ethnic/racial groups through the development of community-based and culturally appropriate interventions. This application also addresses Healthy People 2020's objectives ""to increase the proportion of adolescents who are connected to a parent,"" ""to reduce the proportion of students engaging in binge drinking,"" and ""to reduce new HIV infections among adolescents.""",Culturally-Specific HIV Prevention with Latino Adolescent Alcohol Abusers,9043704,K01AA021081,"['Cultural Assimilation ', '

"Enhanced Intervention to Improve Adolescent Outcomes: A Clinical Trial ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited access to care is a major contributor to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and unintended pregnancy for U.S. adolescents and contributes to significant health disparities, including rates of STIs that are 6-7 times higher for uninsured youths than for insured youths. Racial/ethnic disparities also exist, with African American and Hispanic adolescents evidencing    pregnancy rates that are 4 times higher than White youths. The emergency department (ED) represents an important but underutilized location for reaching large numbers of sexually at-risk adolescents with limited access to evidence-based care and there is growing support for use of the ED to improve adolescent sexual health outcomes. Because few proven interventions are available in the ED to motivate youth to safer sexual behavior and provide health services (e.g., STI testing, condoms), novel interventions are needed. Dr. Miller, a pediatric emergency medicine physician and the candidate for this Career Development Award, is committed    to conducting patient-oriented behavioral research to improve adolescent health outcomes, focusing on underserved communities. Together with a strong multi-disciplinary mentorship team, Dr. Miller has created a four-year career development plan which includes structured mentoring, completion of a Master of Science in Clinical Research, and focused training in the use of health behavior change theories to develop multi-level interventions, research methods and statistical analyses for behavioral intervention trials, effective counseling strategies for health behavior change, health care system and payment models, and responsible conduct of    research. Dr. Miller's training activities will be complemented by an innovative project that will facilitate practical application of these new skills. The goal of the project is to enhance and tes a previously piloted ED SexHealth intervention that uses a dedicated health educator to provide risk reduction counseling, point-of care health services, and referral for ongoing care. Following intervention refinement, Dr. Miller will conduct a randomized trial of the enhanced intervention versus a standard information arm to determine the effect size of rates of health service uptake and enhanced intervention feasibility. We hypothesize that the intervention will result in higher health service uptake and increased condom use versus a standard information arm. The    rationale is that it will produce the first controlled data on an intervention designed to improve adolescent sexual health outcomes using a novel and effective method of delivering care. We expect to use these critical effect size estimates to inform the design of a larger clinical trial o evaluate efficacy. Dr. Miller's training efforts will culminate in the submission of an R01 proposa to fund this trial. This training and research plan are consistent with the mission of the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Healthy People 2020 objectives from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and the 2009 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference.    	     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and unintended pregnancy are costly public health problems that disproportionately affect adolescents, particularly those with limited access to care. Emergency department-based sexual health interventions have potential to reach large    numbers of high-risk youth, but effective interventions are lacking. Our plan to develop a novel intervention is consistent with the mission of the National Institutes of Health as well as with th Healthy People 2020 objectives and has these public health implications: 1) increased access to sexual health services and counseling for underserved youth, 2) decreased time interval to treatment for youth with STIs and HIV, and 3) reduced risk for STI, HIV, and unintended pregnancy. 	            ",Enhanced Intervention to Improve Adolescent Outcomes: A Clinical Trial,9033410,K23HD083405,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral

"Evaluation of an Online Intervention to Help Gay Youth Cope with Bullying ﻿     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) youth experience high rates of peer-related bullying. They are much more likely, compared to heterosexual youth, to experience depression, suicidality, illicit drugs, and become HIV infected. Bullying drives, in part, these health disparities. Worse, anti-bullying programs have shown small to moderate effects. GB males will therefore continue to enter toxic school environments. Bullied LGB youth also have less access to coping resources. We hope to improve health and academic outcomes of LGB youth through an online program these youth can easily access. The study's aims are to: 1) develop a culturally competent, state-of-the-art game to reduce bullying among LGB youth. Diverse groups of LGB youth will provide feedback throughout game design. 2) Evaluate the game's feasibility, acceptability, usability and outcomes in a controlled study among 240 adolescent LGB males 14-18 years of age. Feasibility will be assessed by evaluating factors (e.g., log-on rates, use/duration of components, retention rates), and capacity requirements for future trials. Acceptability and usability will be measured quantitatively and qualitatively by asking about emotional dimensions of the user experience; key factors such as readability, comprehensibility, relevancy, helpfulness, credibility and aesthetics; and gaming (i.e. storyline, game-play, characters). Intervention and control groups will be compared on outcomes (i.e., depression, substance use, sexual risk) and hypothesized mediators (self- efficacy, social skills and future orientation). The application is highly innovative as it is, to our knowledge, the first 1) online program targeting young LGB males who are bullied, a format that can reach far greater numbers of LGB youth than face-to-face interventions, 2) bullying prevention program to utilize a gaming format to attract participation and build retention, 3) bullying intervention addressing social and emotional learning among LGB youth and, 4) first online intervention focusing on 14-18 year old LGB males. The game is informed by stress and coping, social and emotional learning, and social cognitive theory and a logic model that relates theory, game mechanics, hypothesized mediators, and outcomes. Three integral game components will affect outcomes. Participants will take on the role of a virtual `coach' to learn how to effectively cope with bullyng; learn social skills -associated with reduced bullying - by partnering with other players; develop a positive orientation towards the future by identifying role models and developing action plans to achieve positive future selves. This intervention will access large numbers of LGB youth, give them skills sets to avoid bullying, and use on-line technologies to ensure program fidelity; resulting in improved health and academic outcomes among LGB youth, while yielding insights to inform the design of interventions for other marginalized populations.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young gay and bisexual (GB) males are much more likely, compared to heterosexual youth, to experience suicidality, depression, substance abuse, and high-risk sex. They are also much more likely to be bullied at school and studies (reviewed in the application) strongly suggest that bullying victimization is a driver of these health disparitis. However, very little support exists to support these youth. As such, the aims of this application are to develop a state-of-the-art, Internet intervention for 14 - 18 year old GB males and to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, usability and outcomes of the program. This intervention will be the first: 1) online program targeting young GB males who are bullying victims, a format that has the potential to reach far greater numbers of GB youth than traditional face-to-face interventions, 2) bullying prevention program to utilize a gaming format to attract participation and build retention, 3) intervention addressing social and emotional learning with respect to bullying among GB youth and, 4) first online intervention focusing on 14-18 year old GB males - as opposed to the typical focus on GB ""youth"" who are 18 years of age and older. Our focus on younger youth has the potential to affect secondary prevention of the development of downstream psychosocial health problems that result from bullying. Thus, this application could lead to great public health impact by addressing an important problem among GB youth and by giving them real life skills they can use to reduce bullying victimization and longer-term negative health outcomes.

"Speaking Their Language: Using Social Media and Texting to Create an Adolescent-Centered Approach to Healthy Weight Gain During Pregnancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tammy Chang, MD, MPH, MS is a family physician and junior clinical investigator focused on reducing obesity among adolescent mothers and their children. Dr. Chang's long-term career objective is to reduce health disparities among low-income adolescent mothers using tailored eHealth technologies. The objective of this K23 mentored career development award includes a 5-year plan for training and research activities that will provide the skills and experiences needed to become a successful independent investigator. RESEARCH CONTEXT: The United States (US) has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the developed world; the majority of pregnant adolescents gain excess weight during pregnancy. Excess pregnancy weight gain has a significant negative impact on the health of the adolescent mother, increases the risk of dangerous complications during delivery, and contributes to long-term obesity for both mother and child. In recognition of this important population health problem, both the IOM and AHRQ have identified the development of interventions targeting excess pregnancy weight gain as a major research priority. Compared to adults, relatively little is known about pregnancy weight gain among adolescents. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand adolescents' perceptions of and knowledge about pregnancy weight gain, so that researchers can customize interventions and make them relevant to the pregnant adolescent. The short-term goal of this proposal is to acquire the requisite skills to develop an adolescent-centered tailored eHealth intervention to reduce excess pregnancy weight gain. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Determine which US pregnant adolescents (aged ≤21 years) are at high risk for significant excess pregnancy weight gain; 2) Identify the baselin knowledge, beliefs, and factors that influence excess pregnancy weight gain among adolescents; and 3) Design and test a scalable healthy diet and exercise eHealth intervention tailored to at-risk pregnant adolescents. RESEARCH PLAN: To accomplish these aims, Dr. Chang will conduct analyses using nationally representative data from the Fragile Families and Wellbeing Study; carry out social media mining and corresponding qualitative interviews with pregnant and postpartum adolescents; and design, implement, and evaluate an adolescent- centered and tailored eHealth (tailored text-messaging) intervention. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Chang will broaden her knowledge of advanced statistical methods using a large nationally representative dataset; develop skills in mining and analyzing online social media data; acquire expertise in designing, implementing, and evaluating scalable interventions tailored to pregnant adolescents; and obtain experience in translating research findings into clinically relevant policies and practices. Dr. Chang's career development goals will be supported through close mentorship from an interdisciplinary team; guidance from an expert advisory panel; advanced didactic course work; attendance at professional meetings and workshops; participation in seminars and journal clubs; guidance in manuscript preparation and grant proposal development for projects arising from the research she conducts as part of this proposal; and implementing her research plan. This training will directly contribute to Dr. Chang's goal of addressing a vital intergenerational problem of excess pregnancy weight gain among at-risk adolescents, as well as the subsequent submission of a successful R01 application. ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Chang's unique resources include a dedicated and accomplished multi-disciplinary mentorship team with whom she has previously collaborated; the outstanding research infrastructure at the University of Michigan and Department of Family Medicine with a particular emphasis on supporting junior investigators; and numerous advanced didactic courses and seminars provided by several distinct academic units at the University of Michigan.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The US has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the developed world, and most pregnant adolescents in the US gain excess weight during pregnancy. Excess weight gain during pregnancy not only has a significant negative impact on the health of the adolescent mother, it increases the risk of dangerous complications during delivery, and contributes to long- term obesity for both mother and child.

"The Social Context of Adolescent Marijuana Use: A Systems Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The continued rise in adolescent marijuana use and the limited effectiveness of interventions to prevent adolescent marijuana use may be due to the failure to recognize the complexity of peer relationships, including developmental shifts in the prominence of peers vs. romantic partners, changes within romantic relationships, and the interconnected relationship between peers and romantic partners, that lead to the uptake, continuation, and escalation of adolescent marijuana use. The candidate is an epidemiologist, who has been well trained in linear modeling and brings an understanding of the role of partner context on risk behaviors (i.e. condom use and concurrency). To become a successful independent investigator with a career focused on addressing the significant and complex problem of adolescent marijuana use, the candidate requires additional training on the etiology and trajectories of marijuana use and dependence, the development and impact of romantic and peer relationships on decision-making around health compromising behaviors, formal and practical training in complex System Dynamics and mathematical modeling, and a deep understanding of legal and ethical issues associated with adolescent substance use research. The long-term goals of the candidate are to become an independent investigator focused on improving adolescent health by identifying opportunities for health promotion and developmentally appropriate primary drug use prevention strategies. Marijuana use is a significant public health problem due to the breadth of health and social consequences associated with its use. Adolescent marijuana use may be an intractable problem because it is embedded in a complex system. The short-term goals of the candidate are to gain the knowledge and skills to apply a systems science approach to illuminate how the context of romantic relationships drives adolescents' uptake, continuation and escalation of marijuana use. To attain these short- and long-term goals, the training component of the award includes 4 activities: 1) develop expertise in the etiology, physiology and trajectories of adolescent and young adult marijuana abuse and dependence, 2) build a theoretical foundation of sexual, dating and romantic relationships over the course of heterosexual adolescent and young adult development, 3) gain advanced skills in systems science methods, including group model building and mathematical modeling, and 4) gain an understanding of the complex ethical issues involved in drug use research with vulnerable adolescents and young adults. The research component of the award is to quantify the influence of romantic partners on adolescent marijuana use, and to use systems science methodology to incorporate important complexities of peer socialization processes. Specific Aim 1 is to use longitudinal data to estimate the contribution of romantic partner and non-romantic peer influence on adolescent marijuana use. This knowledge will serve as the foundation for developing a quantitative System Dynamics model, which will examine whether there is an effect of romantic partners and the relative magnitude of romantic partners and non-romantic peer influence on frequency of adolescent marijuana use over time. Specific Aim 2 is to use participatory model building (e.g., convened group of multidisciplinary academic and community experts and a group of youth) to create a system diagram incorporating key components of the social system that drive an adolescent's uptake, continuation and escalation of marijuana use over time using an approach grounded in rich theory from diverse disciplines. Specific Aim 3 is to use the system diagram to develop a quantitative simulation model of peer system effects on marijuana use and calibrate the model with available data, including the empirical literature. Upon completion of this award, the candidate will become a productive investigator who has the necessary skills to conduct innovative and compelling interdisciplinary research focused on the etiology of drug use in adolescents. She will understand how social context, specifically the dynamic nature of adolescent romantic and non-romantic peer relationships, affects marijuana use. Model building may help identify feedback loops in the peer system that perpetuates disparities in health and social consequences. Findings from this work may identify leverage points in the system that may be novel, multi-disciplinary and ideally more modifiable than previously identified prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescent marijuana use is a significant health problem and is currently on the rise. Peers, romantic and non- romantic, are known to be great influences of marijuana use. The goal of this project is to incorporate important complexities of the peer influence process to understand how social context, specifically the dynamic nature of adolescent romantic and non-romantic peer relationships, affects adolescent marijuana use.",The Social Context of Adolescent Marijuana Use: A Systems Approach,9037642,K01DA035387,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Cannabis Dependence ', ' Marijuana Dependence ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Marijuana Abuse ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Physiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Socialization ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Social Network ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Discipline ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' uptake ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' peer ', ' intimacy ', ' intimate behavior ', ' member ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Legal ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' youth substance use ', ' substance use among adolescents ', ' adolescent substance use ', ' time use ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' peer influence ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' vulnerable adolescent ', ' Adolescent marijuana use ', ' marijuana use in adolescence ', ' marijuana use among adolescents ', ' cannabis use among adolescents ', ' marijuana use ', ' cannabis use ', ' model building ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' adolescent health ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,184734,0.13356175825580957
"Clinician Comfort and Teen Satisfaction with Motivational Interviewing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The childhood obesity epidemic has led to the rising prevalence of cardiometabolic risks in adolescents. These risks include abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and pre-diabetes, the clustering of which is known as metabolic (or insulin resistance) syndrome. Longitudinal data show that children and adolescents with metabolic syndrome are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes. This is especially worrisome for youth in New Mexico, a culturally diverse state with 44.9% Hispanics and 9.7% American Indians, because obesity disproportionately affects these populations. School-based health centers (SBHCs) offer an important venue to expand healthcare access for adolescents, who are traditionally hard-to- reach. SBHCs provide health services to all students, with a focus on the uninsured and underserved and may be the only point of intervention for low-income and minority youth. The proposed R01 study will build upon significant findings from a NIH/NHLBI funded R21 study that utilized a community-based participatory research approach to develop and pilot-test a SBHC weight management program called Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition and Physical Activity (ACTION) with two high schools. ACTION was based on the use of motivational interviewing (MI) to support adoption of healthier eating and physical activity behaviors. In this current proposal (ACTION PAC), we propose to collaborate with eight high schools that have SBHCs to evaluate the broader reach and efficacy of using MI-based approaches to prevent and treat overweight/obesity and to decrease the risk of metabolic syndrome development. Specifically, our goals are to 1) prevent the development of overweight and obesity among students with BMI <85th percentile, 2) reduce BMI z score and insulin resistance in students with BMI >=85th percentile, and 3) obtain student and parent feedback on their experience with school-based BMI screening and weight management. To test the efficacy of these MI-based approaches, we will employ a cluster randomized control trial design in which four of the eight high schools will be randomized to an intervention group and the other four high schools will be randomized to a usual care comparison group. 960 participants in the 9th and 10th grades between the ages of 14-17 years will be followed annually for two years (until their 11th and 12th grade, respectively). Analyses will be conducted in a multilevel framework to account for clustering within schools. Baseline and 2nd year comparisons within group and comparison of change between the intervention and comparison groups will be assessed. The collective impact of these research outcomes will advance the field of school-based obesity intervention studies and take a significant step towards identifying sustainable prevention and treatment approaches for adolescent obesity and metabolic syndrome through the use of SBHCs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Healthy People 2020 has set objectives to: 1) increase the proportion of health care providers who regularly assess body mass index (BMI) in their adolescent patients, 2) increase the proportion of health care visits that include counseling related to nutrition, weight and physical activity, 3) reduce the proportion of adolescents who are obese, 4) prevent inappropriate weight gain in youth, 5) improve adolescent diet to include more fruits, vegetable and whole grains and less fats and added sugars, and 6) increase the proportion of adolescents who are physically active. The proposed project, ACTION PAC (Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition and Physical Activity), will address all of the above objectives by evaluating a method to motivate high school students to eat healthier, be physically active and achieve or maintain a healthy weight. Primary health care providers in school-based health centers will assess adolescents' BMI and work with them to adopt healthier behaviors to prevent access weight gain and assist those who are overweight or obese with weight management.",Clinician Comfort and Teen Satisfaction with Motivational Interviewing,9134331,R01HL118734,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' American

"HIV and Substance Use Prevention Among Maltreated and Non-Maltreated Female Adolescents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Females diagnosed with HIV have experienced high rates of intimate partner violence, have a history of sexual victimization beginning in childhood, and are significantly more likely to abuse substances (Cavanaugh, Hansen, & Sullivan, 2010; Cohen et al., 2000). However, little is known about how HIV risk behaviors begin and are sustained throughout adolescence among high-risk females who have been abused. In addition, the landscape of sexual socialization is rapidly changing as internet pornography becomes more accessible (Ybarra, Finkelhor, Mitchell, & Wolak, 2009) and social media websites more popular (Rideout, Foehr, Roberts, & Foundation, 2010). Therefore, the current study aims to understand how cyber-sexual socialization is related to HIV risk behavior in conjunction with other risk behaviors (such as substance use) through the person-centered approaches of Latent Class Analysis and Latent Transition Analysis. Using data from the Female Adolescent Development Study (FADS) which followed a high-risk sample (45% African American and 53% maltreated) of female adolescents from age 14-19, the proposed study will (1) identify particular sub-groups of female adolescents at particular risk for substance use and HIV risk behavior before the onset of those behaviors, informing the target population for intervention, (2) identify new risk factors through risky online behavior that are so much a part of adolescents sexual behavior today, informing the relevant content of interventions, (3) identify how clustering of many risk factors related to HIV and substance use transition over time, informing the timing of interventions, and (4) determine how the HIV risk path differs for maltreated adolescents and ethnic minorities so that interventions that target safe sexuality can help all female adolescents navigate safe sexual behavior.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In order to provide the traction necessary to fill in the gaps of knowledge and education to reduce HIV risk and substance use among female adolescents, the proposed study will (1) identify particular sub-groups of female adolescents at particular risk for substance use and HIV risk behavior before the onset of those behaviors, (2) identify new risk factors through risky online behavior that are so much a part of adolescents sexual behavior today, (3) identify how HIV and substance use behaviors transition over time, and (4) determine how the HIV risk path differs for maltreated adolescents and ethnic minorities so that interventions that target sexuality can help all female adolescents navigate safe sexual behavior. By applying new analytic techniques, critical new insight into the dynamic processes involved in HIV risk behavior among female adolescents will be gained.            ",HIV and Substance Use Prevention Among Maltreated and Non-Maltreated Female Adolescents,9113936,F31DA039603,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' Child Sexual Molestation ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Persons ', ' Play ', ' Pornography ', ' adolescents who are pregnant ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' forced sex ', ' Rape ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexuality ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Socialization ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Traction ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Chronic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' European ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' sexually abused ', ' sex abuse ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' safer sexual behavior ', ' safer sex ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Safe Sex ', ' condoms ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' peer ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Population Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Sum ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' violence against women ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' mistreatment ', ' maltreatment ', ' prospective ', ' sexual trauma ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' sexual violence ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' early adolescence ', ' substance use prevention ', ' prevent substance use ', ' adolescent sexual behavior ', ' sexual victimization ', ' social media ', ' ']",NIDA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,F31,2016,12781,-0.009855735683742546
"Community Violence and Reproductive Health among Youth in Salinas, California DESCRIPTION: The objective of this study, led by an early-stage investigator building directly on her NICHD K01 research, is to address gaps in research on structural and interpersonal factors in a rural, agricultural community that influence the onset of youth violence and sexual health risks associated with teen pregnancy during the transition from early to middle adolescence. In California, where one in eight U.S. adolescents reside; Latinas maintain the highest teen birth rate, accounting, in 2010, for 41% of the teen population yet 73% of teen births. Adolescent sexual health research has focused primarily on urban youth; however, one in three California teen births are to Latina teens residing in a rural county. Numerous structural and interpersonal (family, peer, partner) factors that shape the risk environment differ between urban and rural communities. Understanding these underlying contexts that contribute to health disparities is vital to achieving substantive improvements in health outcomes. Our NIH-funded research with Latino adolescents in San Francisco over the past 12 years has highlighted a strong connection between community violence and unintended teen pregnancy. Though traditionally regarded as urban, gangs have emerged in many nonurban areas of the United States. This study will take place in Salinas, CA, an agricultural community located in Monterey County on California's central coast. The U.S. Department of Justice named Salinas as one of six high-risk communities nationally for youth gang violence. Monterey County had the sixth highest teen birth rate in 2010 among California's 58 counties. High rates of youth violence and early childbearing in Salinas, California, coupled with entrenched socioeconomic disparities resulting from generations of Mexican migration for agricultural-sector employment, make research to develop appropriate interventions imperative. This context presents an opportunity to examine the relative salience of structural and interpersonal factors to youth violence and reproductive health in a rural county like numerous others throughout central California. This research was initiated by the Monterey County Health Department and has been developed in partnership with an experienced team of NIH investigators. Informed by the Social Ecological Model of Health, we will accomplish our aims through a mixed-methods design that includes formative qualitative research using focus groups, followed by a 2-year prospective cohort study with a random sample of 600 8th grade students, 40 of whom will be selected to complete prospective in-depth interviews. Our aims are to 1) investigate structural and interpersonal factors that are individually and jointly associated with engagement in violent behaviors and sexual health risks among female and male 8th-grade Latino students in Salinas, CA; 2) examine the trajectories of violent behaviors and sexual risk over time, and their interaction, during the transition from 8th grade to 10th grade; and 3) identify structural and interpersonal factors that influence engagement in violent behaviors and sexual health risks during the transition from 8th grade to 10th grade. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: High rates of youth violence and early childbearing in Salinas, California, coupled with entrenched socioeconomic disparities resulting from generations of Mexican migration for agricultural-sector employment, make research to develop appropriate interventions imperative. This context presents an opportunity to address gaps in research on structural and interpersonal factors in a rural, agricultural community that influence the onset of youth violence and sexual health risks associated with teen pregnancy during the transition from early to middle adolescence. In partnership with the Monterey County Health Department, this study will examine structural and interpersonal factors that affect youth violence and sexual health using a mixed-methods design that includes formative qualitative research using focus groups, followed by a prospective cohort study with a random sample of 600 8th grade students who will be followed for 2 years, 40 of whom will be selected to complete prospective in-depth interviews.","Community Violence and Reproductive Health among Youth in Salinas, California",9057882,R01HD075787,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Birth Rate ', ' California ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Interview ', ' Justice ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Peer Group ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' adolescents who are pregnant ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Schools ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Destinations ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Rural Community ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Mexican ', ' Rural ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' bully ', ' bullying ', ' fighting ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' peer ', ' family structure ', ' gang ', ' 8th grade ', ' eighth grade ', ' high school sophomore ', ' 10th grade ', ' tenth grade ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' junior high school ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Salinum ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' protective behavior ', ' gang violence ', ' teen violence ', ' youth violence ', ' early childbearing ', ' Outcome ', ' teen birth ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' migration ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' secondary outcome ', ' youth violence prevention ', ' prevent youth violence ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' adolescent sexual health ', ' juvenile sexual health ', ' ']",NICHD,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2016,609235,0.05144286985389071
"Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to Reach Vulnerable Young Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Vulnerable female adolescents in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town who use alcohol and other drugs (AOD) and have dropped out of school experience the greatest burden of new HIV infections in South Africa. The risk for acquiring HIV is perpetuated through intersecting factors of AOD use, gender inequality, sexual risk, victimization, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence. Despite the pervasive ongoing transmission of HIV, this vulnerable population remains underserved by current HIV and drug treatment programs, with few providing HIV testing and counselling (HTC), antenatal care, or substance abuse rehabilitation, and none providing comprehensive HTC programs that address these intersecting risks for HIV among this population. Since 2001, we have adapted and conducted a comprehensive evidence-based intervention for women, the Women's Health CoOp (WHC), that addresses AOD use, sexual risk, and gender-based violence. The WHC was listed in the USAID Compendium of Gender Studies in Africa. The Young Women's CoOp (YWC) is an adaptation of the WHC that targets this vulnerable population of AOD using female adolescents. This proposed RFA project seeks to reach this hard-to-reach population and overcome barriers to improved health for female adolescents who have dropped out of school by increasing update of HTC through a comprehensive gender-focused HTC intervention with trained peer co-facilitators and outreach workers from each community. The study findings may provide knowledge that could be used to increase the uptake of services and improve treatment adherence among female adolescents through the use of peer-driven intervention methods. Specific Aims: Our specific aims including the following. In a cluster randomized trial conducted in 12 disadvantaged communities in Cape Town, South Africa, and with government collaboration, we propose: Aim 1. To train and evaluate adolescent peer role models to conduct community outreach with established outreach workers to recruit 500 out-of schools, substance-using female adolescents aged 15-19 for HTC, and to co-facilitate a gender-focused comprehensive HTC program. Aim 2. To test the efficacy of a young women's gender-focused comprehensive HTC program for reducing substance use, victimization, and sexual risk behavior (primary outcomes) and improving access to effective treatment and support services through linkages to care (substance abuse treatment, HIV, STIs, antenatal and reproductive health as secondary outcomes) relative to standard HTC for adolescent females. This study's collaboration with the Western Cape-Department of Social Development and the City of Cape Town will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention within community centers will most likely ensure greater sustainability where it is needed most. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact for the proposed study is tri-fold and described as follows. First, reaching 500 adolescent females in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town with its high rates of school dropout (and often consequent unemployment), substance use, gender inequality, sexual risk, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence is essential for HTC and risk reduction, as these intersecting risk factors appear to be antecedents to the overwhelming gender differences in HIV prevalence among young women relative to men in this region. Second, this study's collaboration with the WC-DoSD will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention and is likely to ensure sustainabiliy of the intervention within communities. Third, determining the efficacy of the comprehensive gender intervention for greater application will be essential for the most at-risk female adolescents.",Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to Reach Vulnerable Young Women,9127926,R01DA041227,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Africa ', ' Belief ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Female ', ' financial assistance ', ' Financial Support ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' adolescents who are pregnant ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Social Development ', ' South Africa ', ' School Dropouts ', ' Student Dropouts ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' USAID ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' sexually active ', ' Inequality ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' uptake ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' motherhood ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Side ', ' Country ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' treatment program ', ' gang ', ' outreach ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Drops ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' gang violence ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 19 year old ', ' nineteen year old ', ' age 19 years ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' sexual violence ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' treatment adherence ', ' efficacy testing ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' substance using adolescents ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' reduced substance use ', ' substance use reduction ', ' reduction in substance use ', ' vulnerable adolescent ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' community center ', ' peer coaching ', ' peer teaching ', ' peer mentoring ', ' peer led team learning ', ' peer instruction ', ' substance abuse rehabilitation ', ' gender-based violence ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' ']",NIDA,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2016,332536,0.04340875552569024
"ACTION PAC: Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition & Physical Activity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The childhood obesity epidemic has led to the rising prevalence of cardiometabolic risks in adolescents. These risks include abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and pre-diabetes, the clustering of which is known as metabolic (or insulin resistance) syndrome. Longitudinal data show that children and adolescents with metabolic syndrome are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes. This is especially worrisome for youth in New Mexico, a culturally diverse state with 44.9% Hispanics and 9.7% American Indians, because obesity disproportionately affects these populations. School-based health centers (SBHCs) offer an important venue to expand healthcare access for adolescents, who are traditionally hard-to- reach. SBHCs provide health services to all students, with a focus on the uninsured and underserved and may be the only point of intervention for low-income and minority youth. The proposed R01 study will build upon significant findings from a NIH/NHLBI funded R21 study that utilized a community-based participatory research approach to develop and pilot-test a SBHC weight management program called Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition and Physical Activity (ACTION) with two high schools. ACTION was based on the use of motivational interviewing (MI) to support adoption of healthier eating and physical activity behaviors. In this current proposal (ACTION PAC), we propose to collaborate with eight high schools that have SBHCs to evaluate the broader reach and efficacy of using MI-based approaches to prevent and treat overweight/obesity and to decrease the risk of metabolic syndrome development. Specifically, our goals are to 1) prevent the development of overweight and obesity among students with BMI <85th percentile, 2) reduce BMI z score and insulin resistance in students with BMI >=85th percentile, and 3) obtain student and parent feedback on their experience with school-based BMI screening and weight management. To test the efficacy of these MI-based approaches, we will employ a cluster randomized control trial design in which four of the eight high schools will be randomized to an intervention group and the other four high schools will be randomized to a usual care comparison group. 960 participants in the 9th and 10th grades between the ages of 14-17 years will be followed annually for two years (until their 11th and 12th grade, respectively). Analyses will be conducted in a multilevel framework to account for clustering within schools. Baseline and 2nd year comparisons within group and comparison of change between the intervention and comparison groups will be assessed. The collective impact of these research outcomes will advance the field of school-based obesity intervention studies and take a significant step towards identifying sustainable prevention and treatment approaches for adolescent obesity and metabolic syndrome through the use of SBHCs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Healthy People 2020 has set objectives to: 1) increase the proportion of health care providers who regularly assess body mass index (BMI) in their adolescent patients, 2) increase the proportion of health care visits that include counseling related to nutrition, weight and physical activity, 3) reduce the proportion of adolescents who are obese, 4) prevent inappropriate weight gain in youth, 5) improve adolescent diet to include more fruits, vegetable and whole grains and less fats and added sugars, and 6) increase the proportion of adolescents who are physically active. The proposed project, ACTION PAC (Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition and Physical Activity), will address all of the above objectives by evaluating a method to motivate high school students to eat healthier, be physically active and achieve or maintain a healthy weight. Primary health care providers in school-based health centers will assess adolescents' BMI and work with them to adopt healthier behaviors to prevent access weight gain and assist those who are overweight or obese with weight management.",ACTION PAC: Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition & Physical Activity,9119537,R01HL118734,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', '

"Early Life Determinants of Accelerated Pubertal Development in Adolescent Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Kubo's long-term career goal is to understand early-life determinants of cancer risk factors that relate to obesity and metabolic dysregulation, and to identify high-risk sub-populations that can benefit from early intervention strategies. Her primary research aim is to examine whether factors such as intrauterine exposure to maternal gestational diabetes (GDM), excessive gestational weight gain, obesity, and rapid infant weight gain increase the risk of accelerated pubertal onset in adolescent girls, an important breast and reproductive cancer risk factor. Her secondary aim is to explore the causes of the observed racial/ethnic differences in timing of puberty. No previous studies have examined these associations. These research goals will take advantage of electronic health data that are available in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated health plan that covers about 450,000 girls. Two specific approaches are proposed: 1. Linkage of mothers' and daughters' electronic health data in an on-going prospective study of predictors of sexual maturation in adolescent girls (U01 ES/CA019435) (Study 1); and, 2. Establishment of a new cohort of 20,000 multiethnic mother-daughter pairs using the electronic databases within KPNC (Study 2). Study 1 will utilize data from the CYGNET study (PI: Lawrence H. Kushi, ScD), which has been following 444 girls annually since 2005 with extensive information on pubertal development and anthropometric measures. The KPNC GDM and Pregnancy Glucose Tolerance Registry (Director: Assiamira Ferrara, MD, PhD) will be linked to the CYGNET data to accomplish study 1. In addition, the Registry will be used to establish a new cohort of mother-daughter pairs. This will allow Dr. Kubo gain experience and skills in establishing and follow a cohort based on KPNC electronic medical record data, and to explore racial/ethnic differences in pubertal onset. Electronic documentation of Tanner stage (an established five-stage classification scheme to assess pubertal development) from routine pediatric visits has recently been implemented at KPNC, and this availability on a large and diverse pediatric population makes this study unique and innovative. The candidate's research goals will be complemented with formal, mentored training through coursework and tailored tutorials in pediatric endocrinology, intergenerational transmission of metabolic dysregulation, advanced biostatistics, cancer prevention and health disparities, and responsible conduct of research. KPNC's Division of Research is an ideal environment for the proposed training because it provides unique and extensive electronic databases, access to data from a large, multiethnic membership, and internationally-recognized multidisciplinary experts. The planned scientific training and mentorship will build on the candidate's previous training in nutrition and cancer epidemiology, and uniquely position her to attain her goals. The proposed studies will provide crucial skills in establishing a new cohort, providing a platform for Dr. Kubo to develop successful R01 research to further elucidate early life determinants of pubertal onset and other cancer risk factors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past century, adolescent girls have been maturing significantly earlier in the United States, with substantial racial/ethnic differences. Early-maturing girls are at risk for a variety of negative health outcomes, including increased risk of breast and other reproductive cancers, though aside from obesity, little is known as to what early life factors influence the timing of pubertal development. The proposed research will allow me to better understand early determinants of accelerated pubertal development in girls and to identify high risk populations, which can inform future effective upstream cancer prevention strategies.",Early Life Determinants of Accelerated Pubertal Development in Adolescent Girls,9121381,K07CA166143,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Affect ', '

"Family Aggression and Trajectories of Adolescent Adaptation: Bioregulatory Effect DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aggressive marital conflict and harsh parenting (family aggression) are highly prevalent. Chronic exposure to family aggression elevates adolescents' risk for antisocial and risky behavior, depressed mood, and cognitive decrements - significant public health problems that increase in prevalence and severity during adolescence. Explaining variability in trajectories of adaptation in the context of family aggression - why some adolescent's exhibit resilience and others deteriorate - is a critical need for science and practice. Findings stemming from the proposed study will illuminate autonomic nervous system activity and sleep regulation variables (bioregulatory processes), as well as economic and social context (peer affiliation) variables, which may mediate the risk of family aggression or operate to exacerbate or protect against its effects on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral maladjustment from late childhood through late adolescence. The design builds on a well-characterized 3-wave study; children ranged between 8-11 years across waves. The proposed study will involve 3 additional waves with a 1-year lag: 50% girls, ~14-15 years at T4, with high representation of both African-American and lower SES families. Study constructs are assessed with multiple informants and measures. Sleep parameters are examined objectively, via actigraphy, and subjectively. ANS activity (sympathetic and parasympathetic) is measured with standard indices, and reactivity is assessed with well-established lab procedures. The large and diverse sample, breadth of measurement across important adolescent outcome domains, and a 6-wave longitudinal design will permit analyses of long- term developmental trajectories, interactions among biopsychosocial processes, and profiles of family, bioregulatory and socioecological risk. The proposed study will create new knowledge in areas of great significance through investigations of bioregularoty and socioecological variables that have the potential to enhance understanding of risk among adolescents exposed to family aggression and to identify physiological, behavioral, and ecological targets for intervention. Outcome variables include public health priorities, such as behavioral and emotional adjustment, academic performance (PA-07-046, Research on Mind-Body Interactions and Health), violence (PA-09-169, Research on Teen Dating Violence), and sleep disturbances (PA-07-140, Research on Sleep and Sleep Disorders). Hypotheses will be tested across a wide range of socioecological contexts with a diverse community sample (PA-07-379, Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities). Other key strengths include our focus on estimating trajectories of adolescent functioning across multiple domains; considering the direction of effects between constructs; and comparing the strength of associations at different time points across development. Aggressive marital conflict and harsh parenting are highly prevalent and elevate adolescents' risk for antisocial and risky behavior, depressed mood, and cognitive decrements- significant public health problems that increase in prevalence and severity during adolescence. However, the potential effects of bioregulatory and socioecological variables on trajectories of adolescent adjustment in the context of family aggression are not well understood. The proposed study will illuminate autonomic nervous system activity, sleep regulation, and socioecological variables that may mediate the risk of family aggression or operate to exacerbate or protect against its effects on adolescent functioning across multiple domains from late childhood through late adolescence, which will help identify behavioral, physiological, and ecological targets for prevention and intervention.",Family Aggression and Trajectories of Adolescent Adaptation: Bioregulatory Effect,9045648,R01HD046795,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Economics ', ' Moderator Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Effect Modifiers ', ' Conditional Variables ', ' Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology) ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Methods ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Schedule ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Staging ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' mind body interaction ', ' brain-body interaction ', ' Relations, Mind-Body (Physiology) ', ' Mind-Body Relationship (Physiology) ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' emotional style ', ' emotional adaptation ', ' emotional adjustment ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' Performance ', ' sleep control ', ' sleep regulation ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' actigraphy ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Developmental Process ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' Teen Dating Violence ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' negative mood ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' peer influence ', ' stem ', ' social science research ', ' public health priorities ', ' longitudinal design ', ' antisocial behavior ', ' anti-social behavior ', ' adolescent health ', ' ']",NICHD,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,R01,2016,521006,0.09303270347757109
"Identifying Environmental Factors Promoting HIV/STI Risk in Black Adolescents and Young Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect Black adolescents and young adults in the United States. Environmental or structural factors such as discrimination, crime, and poverty have been proposed as potential drivers of persistent racial disparities. Though HIV and STI incidence tend to be geospatially clustered, the specific environmental predictors of clustering among Black adolescents and young adults are not well understood. Exploratory mapping using geographic information systems (GIS) has revealed that HIV and STI incidence in adolescents and young adults is higher in certain neighborhoods in Massachusetts, the setting of the proposed project. Determining the associations between specific environmental factors in neighborhoods and HIV/STI incidence in Black adolescents and young adults is important for intervention planning. Candidate: My career goal is to become an independent investigator focused on developing structural interventions for HIV/STI prevention in underserved communities. As a physician trained in Infectious Diseases, I am fully committed to overcoming persistent health disparities noted among people at risk for and living with HIV and STIs. To become an independent investigator, I require additional research training and mentorship, building on the clinical, publc health, and implementation science training that I have previously received. Research Proposal: The primary objective of this proposal is to determine the relationships between neighborhood-level environmental factors and HIV/STI incidence in Black adolescents and young adults. The proposed study has three AIMs: (1) to qualitatively explore the impact that environmental factors have on HIV and STI risk behavior by conducting focus groups with Black adolescents and young adults from higher and lower HIV/STI incidence neighborhoods; (2) to quantitatively determine the association between selected environmental factors and HIV/STI incidence using geospatial analysis; and (3) to use a mixed- methods participatory approach to identify interventions to address environmental factors associated with HIV/STIs using data gathered in AIMs 1 and 2. Training: The research plan will be supported by courses in qualitative, quantitative, and geospatial analyses, clinical trial design and utilization of large scale socio-behavioral and demographic data sets for secondary analyses. Mentorship and Resources: My mentorship team will be co-led by Dr. Kenneth Mayer, Infectious Disease Specialist and expert in HIV/STI prevention and Dr. Laura Bogart, social psychologist with expertise in disparities in HIV, adolescent health, and qualitative and quantitative methods. To achieve my goals, I will avail myself of the resources available within the Division of Global Health Equity at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Fenway Institute of Fenway Health (www.thefenwayinstitute.org), and the Harvard Center for AIDS Research. I will also benefit from a team of dedicated advisors in geospatial analysis, behavioral health and adolescent sexual health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect Black adolescents and young adults. Environmental or structural factors - practices, policies, institutional and contextual forces that are external to and outsideof an individual's control - may promote or protect against HIV/STI acquisition and contribute to persistent racial disparities. Discrimination, crime, poverty and community beliefs about homosexuality are environmental factors that may be associated with HIV and STI risk in Black adolescents and young adults. Both HIV/STI incidence and these environmental factors tend to be clustered geographically. However, the specific environmental predictors of HIV/STI clustering among Black adolescents and young adults are not well understood. This research seeks to understand the relationships between neighborhood-level environmental factors and HIV/STI incidence in Black adolescents and young adults. Determining the associations between specific environmental factors and HIV/STI risk and incidence is important for focused intervention planning in this vulnerable population.",Identifying Environmental Factors Promoting HIV/STI Risk in Black Adolescents and Young Adults,9090172,K23MH107316,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anger ', ' Belief ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Crime ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Homosexuality ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Maps ', ' Massachusetts ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychologist ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Institutional Policy ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Review Literature ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' American ', ' skills ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' psychological distress ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' behavioral health ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobia  ', ' Homophobic ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' adolescent health ', ' adolescent sexual health ', ' juvenile sexual health ', ' ']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2016,183338,0.0910183484452519
"Multilevel Protective Factors For LGB Youth In North America DESCRIPTION: A growing body of literature demonstrates dramatic disparities in health between lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) and heterosexual youth, including problem substance use, HIV risk behaviors and suicide. In 2011 the Institute of Medicine called for additional research with this population, prioritizing health disparities research as ""essential for building  solid evidence base"" in LGB heath. The IOM report highlights the importance of multilevel social influences on the lives of LGB people, specifying the role of social structures such as families, schools, workplaces, religious institutions and community organizations as critical subjects of study to expand our understanding of the determinants of health in this population.  The proposed R01 led by a new investigator in response to PA-12-111, directly addresses this need. The goal of this study is to broaden and deepen our understanding of the family, peer, school and community environments that protect young LGB people from involvement in high risk health behaviors, including substance use, HIV risk behaviors and suicide behaviors. This research aims to 1) develop a theoretically grounded approach to promoting health among LGB adolescents based on in-depth knowledge of their community and school environments, and 2) link environmental data, collected using the Inventory, with existing population-based student data to identify factors at the individual, family, peer, school and community levels that protect LGB youth from involvement in health risk behaviors. ""Go-along"" interviews with 72 youth in diverse locations will be used to elicit in-depth information on LGB adolescents' perceptions of supportive elements in their schools and communities; this information, in conjunction with published literature, expert review, and psychometric testing, will be used to create an LGB Environment Inventory to characterize policies, programs, resources and other supports for LGB youth that exist in these settings. The Inventory will then be used to measure indicators of support in 120 communities in Minnesota, British Columbia and Massachusetts, using publicly available materials (e.g. websites) and brief contacts with key informants (Aim 1). These community-level data will then be linked with existing student survey data from approximately 3,600 LGB adolescents in these same communities, which will include information about family, peer and individual supports, as well as health behaviors and demographic information (Aim 2). The following hypotheses will be tested: a) higher LGB environment scores for the community and school will be protective against health risk behaviors among LGB youth; b) greater family connectedness and support and a more supportive peer environment will be protective against health risk behaviors among LGB youth, and c) family, peer and individual-level factors will moderate the associations between the LGB environment (community and school) and the health risk behaviors of interest. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application for a mixed methods study using a social ecological approach is directly responsive to the 2011 IOM report and the NIH's call for research to advance the health of LGB populations. Findings from this innovative work will indicate specific features of the LGB environment which are protective against health risk behaviors and poor outcomes, and specific subgroups of LGB young people to be targeted for maximum impact. Interventions will build on these insights to increase supports for LGB youth in their families, among their peers, at their schools and in their communities, ultimately extending their protective benefits across the LGB youth population and reducing health disparities.",Multilevel Protective Factors For LGB Youth In North America,9037518,R01HD078470,"['Age ', ' Attention ', ' British Columbia ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' In element ', ' Indium ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Literature ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' North America ', ' Perception ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' health in school ', ' school health ', ' Schools ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Students ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Family member ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Review Literature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Study Subject ', ' episodic drinking ', ' binge alcohol consumption ', ' binge drinking ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' informant ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' collaborative environment ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' school district ', ' illicit drug use ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2016,406748,0.019957808915267536
"Changing the Narrative:  Using Media to Shift Social Norms of Violence Among Youth in West Louisville ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth violence is a serious public health issue, particularly in the disproportionate burden upon economically disadvantaged, inner city, and minority populations. Intentional injury is the leading cause of death among persons 10 to 24 years of age in Kentucky, and the second leading cause of death for this age group nationally. Alarmingly, Kentucky's homicide rate for this same age group is 10 times higher for Black males (38.7/100,000) than for White males (3.9/100,000). In Louisville, KY, substantial social and health disparities-including violence and related risk factors-are concentrated in West Louisville (WL), an economically disadvantaged, urban, primarily Black community. Led by the School of Public Health & Information Sciences (SPHIS), researchers at the University of Louisville (UofL) propose to establish the UofL Youth Violence Prevention Center, partnering with researchers from Vanderbilt University. The specific aims of the proposed center include: 1. Strengthen the infrastructure to support youth violence prevention research and practice at the University of Louisville. 2. Develop, implement and evaluate a community-level social norming campaign to change the norms of violence among youth in West Louisville using mass and social media. 3. Document the development and implementation of the social norming campaign to improve replication and scalability in other settings or communities. 4. Evaluate the relationship between community readiness, community capacity, and the implementation of the community-level social norming campaign. 5. Disseminate study findings in meaningful and actionable format to a variety of relevant audiences (i.e., community, local organizations and leaders, youth violence prevention researchers and practitioners, academic peers, and policy-makers). The interdisciplinary research team proposes a quasi-experimental design to examine the effectiveness of using a community-level 3-year social norming campaign utilizing new media to change norms of violence among youth 10-24 and introduce prosocial norms driven by cultural identity, with WL as the intervention community and East Nashville, TN as the control community. The researchers and a team of community collaborators will with a professional advertising agency to plan and design the campaign, which will be deployed in Year 2. Surveys and interviews will capture data measuring our dependent variables of social norms and violent behavior (independent variables: campaign exposure by media type, demographics), and population-level youth violence data from schools, emergency departments, and local police departments will offer measures of change in serious youth violence at the population level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intentional injury is the leading cause of death among youth ages 10 to 24 in Kentucky, and the homicide rate in the state for the same age group is 10 times higher for Black males (38.7/100,000) than for White males (3.9/100,000). Youth in West Louisville, a predominantly Black, economically disadvantaged, urban community are subjected to social norms of violence. A targeted community-level social norming campaign holds potential to shift existing norms and reduce serious violence among young people in this community.",Changing the Narrative:  Using Media to Shift Social Norms of Violence Among Youth in West Louisville,9145620,U01CE002711,[''],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,U01,2016,1296752,0.03179384803259817
"Dietary Supplement Creatine for Adolescent Females with SSRI-Resistant Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Submitted in response to PAR-11-177, this combined R21/R33 application pairs a dietary supplement intervention intended to target energy metabolism in the brain with translational neuroimaging measures of brain high-energy metabolites that are deficient in mood disorders. Piloting a novel intervention for female adolescents with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD), while quantifying its engagement of a mechanistic target, supports specific strategies outlined in the strategic plans of the National Institute of Mental Health and the Office of Dietary Supplements. The long-term goal of this research program is to delineate the alterations in mitochondrial brain energy metabolism that are associated with mood disorders. Converging lines of evidence suggest that depression is associated with changes in brain energy metabolism that normalize with resolution of a depressive episode. 31-Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (31P-MRSI), a safe and non-invasive imaging method, allows in vivo measurement of concentrations in specific high-energy cerebral metabolites. These include beta-nucleoside triphosphate (ß-NTP; largely adenosine triphosphate, or ATP) and phosphocreatine (PCr). 31P-MRSI studies of adults with MDD show a pattern of changes in brain energy metabolism: increased PCr and decreased ß-NTP. More common in females, this pattern is associated with an increased likelihood of response to both antidepressants in treatment-naive MDD, and thyroid hormone augmentation in treatment-resistant MDD. The organic acid creatine is endogenous to all vertebrates, and is known to play a vital role in maintaining ATP supplies in brain and skeletal muscle. In preclinical animal models, creatine supplementation alters rodent depression-like behaviors in a gender-dependent manner that favors females. In healthy adults, dietary supplementation with creatine increases total brain creatine, and induces the pattern of alterations in PCr and ß-NTP noted above, suggesting the possibility of using creatine to promote a treatment-responsive state in MDD. In the R21 proof- of-concept study, we propose to test the hypothesis that creatine targets and alters brain energy metabolism in female adolescents selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-resistant MDD. Participants will be treated for 8 weeks with one of four regimens: placebo or creatine 2g, 4g or 10g daily. 31P-MRSI measurements of PCr and ß-NTP will be performed at baseline, and repeated after 8 weeks of treatment. If the R21 study milestones are met, we will proceed to an R33 pilot study. Using the dose of creatine that offered the best combination of target engagement and tolerability in the R21 study, a randomized placebo-controlled feasibility study of creatine for adolescent females with SSRI-resistant MDD will be conducted. public health relevance of this research stems from the fact that the cumulative prevalence of MDD is 15-24% by age nineteen, and the limitations of available treatments. Furthermore, adolescence marks a critical developmental period in which the rate of MDD in females doubles, remaining twice that of males throughout women's reproductive years.

"Life-course pathways linking adolescent childbearing to chronic conditions: A pilot study to reinforce research and health system capacity in Northeast Brazil Project Summary: This project has two principal objectives: 1) Improve health system and research capacity in the community of Santa Cruz, which is located in the region of Northeast Brazil and 2) Apply that capacity in order to conduct epidemiological research investigating pathways that may explain how and why adolescent childbirth is associated to chronic conditions and mobility loss in middle-aged and older women. Such information is vital to developing preventative public health interventions to address non-communicable diseases across the life-course. Lessons learned from this research would add to the research evidence-base for policy and action on adolescent pregnancy and, more broadly, women's health in Latin America. Specifically, this project aims to: 1) Train students from the Santa Cruz campus of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (Brazil) to conduct epidemiological interviews, collect biological samples, and take anthropometric and clinical measures. It will also provide in-depth, specialized training on ethical research conduct when working with pregnant and adolescent women; 2) Develop and validate epidemiological questionnaires adapted to a low-education, rural, adolescent, Portuguese-speaking population; 3) Prospectively follow a pilot cohort of adolescent and adult women, pregnant for the first time, from the 1st trimester of pregnancy to 6-weeks postpartum. This pilot would collect questionnaire data (baseline), clinical measurements, and biomarker concentrations (baseline, 3rd trimester, 6-weeks postpartum). The proposed pilot study, which is the 3rd study aim, will lay the foundation for a more expansive and comprehensive research program investigating hypothesized mechanisms behind previously documented associations between adolescent childbirth and poor later-life health. Overall, the capacity built and sustained from this project will contribute to advancing health research in one of the most underserved regions of Brazil. It will provide training to the next generation of Brazilian researchers and establish long-term networks between Brazilian and United States researchers.   This proposed study will examine the long-term effects of adolescent pregnancy, such as disease and disability, among women in Northeast Brazil, a population that suffers from economic, gender, and health inequities at a higher rate than those in urban areas in Brazil. This will include collaborating with the newly-established Santa Cruz campus of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte to build their infrastructure and training capacity to carry out public

"Transition to Medication Self-Management for Youth with ASD & Co-Occurring ADHD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects roughly 1 in 88 US children. Service delivery can be complicated during transition from youth to adulthood, when youth must begin to manage their own healthcare. Essential skills include making appointments, communicating with providers, and understanding and following medication regimens. Medication regimens may be especially important to the 30-50% of youth with ASD who also experience symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These youth have greater difficulty in day-to-day life, higher levels of psychopathology, lower quality of life and poorer adaptive functioning. They are more likely to use psychotropic medications (58%) compared to youth with ASD or ADHD alone (34% and 49%, respectively). Transition and adherence challenges can peak at the same lifestage among later adolescents and college students. Disruption or cessation of medication routines among youth with ASD/ADHD leaves them vulnerable to otherwise preventable setbacks in previously-achieved skills. UNMET NEED: Ever-increasing prevalence estimates of both ASD and ADHD mean that increasing numbers of youth are affected by these disorders as they enter adulthood. The changing health care environment demands patient engagement and shared decision-making, yet patients remain largely on their own to learn essential skills and find supportive resources. This may pose a particular challenge for higher-functioning patients with ASD/ADHD. OBJECTIVE: In this Clinical Trial Planning Grant, we will develop and pilot a manualized intervention for Transition to Medication Self-Management (T-MSM) for higher-functioning youth with ASD/ADHD, to arm youth with the skills and tools they need as adults to navigate the healthcare system and successfully transition to self-management of medications. Our three Aims are: 1) a community-based survey to assess patient/family needs and test feasibility of recruitment; 2) development of a manualized curriculum, using a participatory approach that involves patients; providers; family and scientific advisors; and 3) a pilot RCT to test feasibility of our intervention and obtan preliminary data on the impact of the T-MSM intervention, compared to an enhanced standard of care (ESC) control intervention. INNOVATION: We will prepare youth with ASD with tools to self-manage their medication use and related healthcare. Consistent with national goals for health literacy and patient empowerment --in a climate where demand for providers exceeds supply --it is essential to help patients engage and participate in their medical management. SIGNIFICANCE: Upon completion of these aims, we will have a comprehensive community-wide sample frame from which we can rapidly draw a diverse, representative sample for a larger trial, and an engaging, effective, and efficient manualized program and supportive resources. We will be prepared to conduct a larger RCT, among youth with co-occurring ASD/ADHD, to assess the impact of T-MSM program; transition outcomes; and the duration of effects on self-management of medications and related healthcare in adulthood. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The expanding cohort of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (currently 1:88 US children) portends a coming wave of adolescents and young adults who will require transition to and care for ASD in adulthood. Adolescents' transition into adult functioning requires them to have the capacity to manage their healthcare. Intervention to arm youth with the skills and tools they need to navigate healthcare may improve knowledge, skills and transition outcomes for youth with ASD and could be expanded to improve transition for youth with other special healthcare needs.",Transition to Medication Self-Management for Youth with ASD & Co-Occurring ADHD,9130042,R34MH104231,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Appointment ', ' Attention ', ' Belief ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' family medicine ', ' Family Practice ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Motivation ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Self Management ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' tool ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' empowerment ', ' case finding ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' practice-based research network ', ' health literacy ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' standard of care ', ' restrictive repetitive behavior ', ' shared decision making ', ' Regimen ', ' arm ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' cognitive ability ', ' learning materials ', ' instructional materials ', ' curricular material ', ' course material ', ' class material ', ' ']",NIMH,AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS,R34,2016,215182,0.051800573612982286
"Teens' Risk During Transition: Preventing Drug Use, HIV & School Problems DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The transition to middle school can be a risky time for many adolescents, as youth are exposed to a host of new academic challenges and social relationships with older peers. Being placed foster care amplifies this risk. The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized effectiveness trial to determine whether adding a preventive intervention at this critical transition period is effective and cost effective in terms of ameliorating outcomes such as drug and tobacco use, participation in HIV- risking sexual behavior, delinquency, mental health problems, and school failure for young adolescents in foster care. The proposed LINKS intervention marries the goals of child welfare and educational systems and will be implemented in the San Diego Unified School District which is the 2nd largest school district in California. LINKS, a 20-week, two pronged intervention that focuses on increasing parent and youth skills and support will be delivered by community-based paraprofessionals who will be trained and supervised to implement the intervention. An ongoing fidelity monitoring system will allow for the calibration of intervention staff performance to adherence standards, provide performance standards for local staff training, and build in monitoring for local support and oversight (i.e., at the system leadership level) in the school district and child welfare systems. The study is designed to maximize the potential for uptake, sustainability, and future scale-up to other school and child welfare systems given positive results from this effectiveness trial. The aims are: a) to determine the effectiveness of the LINKS intervention on key behavioral health and school adjustment outcomes, b) to examine mechanisms of action; specifically the mediating effects of placement failure on outcomes, c) to examine the moderating role of fidelity on outcomes, and d) to examine cost effectiveness and cost avoidance of LINKS. All eligible 5th graders enrolled in the San Diego Unified School District placed in foster or kinship care (and their caretakers) will be recruited over a 4-year period and will be assessed at baseline, and at 6, 12, and 18 month follow-ups. It is hypothesized that those participating in LINKS will experience fewer negative behavioral health outcomes and better school adjustment and that these effects will be mediated by higher levels of placement stability and moderated by intervention fidelity scores. The project seeks to determine if a preventive intervention delivered at the entry to middle school ameliorates the well-documented risks of negative behavioral health and school adjustment outcomes for youth placed in foster care. An estimated 20 billion dollars are spent annually in the child welfare system, yet studies consistently find that youth in foster care have disproportionately high rates of drug and tobacco use, delinquency, participation in health risking sexual behavior, and poor developmental and mental health problems. The period of transition into middle school is a critical time when there is an opportunity to prevent school adjustment and behavioral health difficulties that cause cascading negative long term outcomes. The proposed trial is situated within community systems and implemented by paraprofessional interventionists to promote uptake and sustainability.","Teens' Risk During Transition: Preventing Drug Use, HIV & School Problems",9023520,R01DA032634,"['Accounting ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Calibration ', ' California ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Paper ', ' Parents ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Records ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Savings ', ' Schools ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' economic evaluation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' uptake ', ' foster parent ', ' foster care ', ' System ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Services ', ' information gathering ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' economic impact ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' junior high school ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' early initiation drug use ', ' early onset drug use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' mistreatment ', ' maltreatment ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Trauma ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' service intervention ', ' staff intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' school district ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDA,"OREGON SOCIAL LEARNING CENTER, INC.",R01,2016,509771,-0.006077380800006896
"Early Adversity Shapes Adolescent Risk Behavior Trajectories in Mexican Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over half a million people in the United States have died of AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic, and the number of people living with HIV infection is higher now than ever before. Currently, over 1 million adults and adolescents in the US are living with HIV. The majority of new HIV cases occur before age 25 and young Latinos are disproportionately affected. Compared to non-Latino white youths, Latino adolescents have 4 times the risk of HIV infection and, by young adulthood, more than 4 times the rate of AIDS diagnosis. Latinos are more likely to use substances in early adolescence and more likely to engage in unprotected sex than other ethnic groups, which increases their risk for HIV/AIDS. These disparities are persistent and represent a critical public health issue given the growing population of young Latinos in the US. Mexican Americans represent the largest subgroup of Latinos, yet longitudinal studies with Mexican American youth have been sparse due to a host of methodological barriers. The proposed longitudinal research resolves these issues to address important scientific gaps. By building on a rich, well-established, long-term cohort of Mexican American children and their parents, this project aims to understand whether and how adversity exposure in early life contributes to the emergence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence. Towards this aim, we will gather detailed information on substance use and sexual risk-taking at ages 14y and 15.5y, when adolescents are sustaining the major social and biological transitions of the pubertal period. The strong study design builds on: (1) rich adversit data already collected during pregnancy and throughout childhood for this established cohort of Mexican American youth and their parents, combined with new equally rich data collection proposed in adolescence; (2) impressive participant retention to date in this hard-to-reach population; (3) ongoing assessing of puberty using leading-edge clinic-based methods obtained at multiple points in time; (4) the inclusion of new measures of stress responsively and pubertal hormones to better understand underlying bio physiological processes; and (5) the inclusion of key protective factors, including parental influences and cultural factors, that may buffer against risk for adolescent problem behaviors. Results from this project will yield important information about the emergence of substance use and sexual risk-taking within this highly vulnerable group. By focusing on potentially modifiable characteristics, this research has the potential to elucidate distinct areas to target for intervention to prevent risk-taking behaviors in adolescence and thereby reduce risk for HIV/AIDS and other STIs over the life course. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is increasing recognition that early life events influence long-term health and health disparities. The design of this study allows us to longitudinally examine the effects of early adversity on the emergence of substance use and risky sexual behaviors among Mexican American adolescents, as well as key factors that may mediate or moderate these effects. This research aims to elucidate targets for intervention to prevent risk- taking behaviors in adolescence and thereby reduce risk for HIV/AIDS and other STIs over the life course.",Early Adversity

"Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to Reach Vulnerable Young Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Vulnerable female adolescents in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town who use alcohol and other drugs (AOD) and have dropped out of school experience the greatest burden of new HIV infections in South Africa. The risk for acquiring HIV is perpetuated through intersecting factors of AOD use, gender inequality, sexual risk, victimization, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence. Despite the pervasive ongoing transmission of HIV, this vulnerable population remains underserved by current HIV and drug treatment programs, with few providing HIV testing and counselling (HTC), antenatal care, or substance abuse rehabilitation, and none providing comprehensive HTC programs that address these intersecting risks for HIV among this population. Since 2001, we have adapted and conducted a comprehensive evidence-based intervention for women, the Women's Health CoOp (WHC), that addresses AOD use, sexual risk, and gender-based violence. The WHC was listed in the USAID Compendium of Gender Studies in Africa. The Young Women's CoOp (YWC) is an adaptation of the WHC that targets this vulnerable population of AOD using female adolescents. This proposed RFA project seeks to reach this hard-to-reach population and overcome barriers to improved health for female adolescents who have dropped out of school by increasing update of HTC through a comprehensive gender-focused HTC intervention with trained peer co-facilitators and outreach workers from each community. The study findings may provide knowledge that could be used to increase the uptake of services and improve treatment adherence among female adolescents through the use of peer-driven intervention methods. Specific Aims: Our specific aims including the following. In a cluster randomized trial conducted in 12 disadvantaged communities in Cape Town, South Africa, and with government collaboration, we propose: Aim 1. To train and evaluate adolescent peer role models to conduct community outreach with established outreach workers to recruit 500 out-of schools, substance-using female adolescents aged 15-19 for HTC, and to co-facilitate a gender-focused comprehensive HTC program. Aim 2. To test the efficacy of a young women's gender-focused comprehensive HTC program for reducing substance use, victimization, and sexual risk behavior (primary outcomes) and improving access to effective treatment and support services through linkages to care (substance abuse treatment, HIV, STIs, antenatal and reproductive health as secondary outcomes) relative to standard HTC for adolescent females. This study's collaboration with the Western Cape-Department of Social Development and the City of Cape Town will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention within community centers will most likely ensure greater sustainability where it is needed most. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact for the proposed study is tri-fold and described as follows. First, reaching 500 adolescent females in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town with its high rates of school dropout (and often consequent unemployment), substance use, gender inequality, sexual risk, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence is essential for HTC and risk reduction, as these intersecting risk factors appear to be antecedents to the overwhelming gender differences in HIV prevalence among young women relative to men in this region. Second, this study's collaboration with the WC-DoSD will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention and is likely to ensure sustainabiliy of the intervention within communities. Third, determining the efficacy of the comprehensive gender intervention for greater application will be essential for the most at-risk female adolescents.",Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to

"Changing the Narrative:  Using Media to Shift Social Norms of Violence Among Youth in West Louisville ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth violence is a serious public health issue, particularly in the disproportionate burden upon economically disadvantaged, inner city, and minority populations. Intentional injury is the leading cause of death among persons 10 to 24 years of age in Kentucky, and the second leading cause of death for this age group nationally. Alarmingly, Kentucky's homicide rate for this same age group is 10 times higher for Black males (38.7/100,000) than for White males (3.9/100,000). In Louisville, KY, substantial social and health disparities-including violence and related risk factors-are concentrated in West Louisville (WL), an economically disadvantaged, urban, primarily Black community. Led by the School of Public Health & Information Sciences (SPHIS), researchers at the University of Louisville (UofL) propose to establish the UofL Youth Violence Prevention Center, partnering with researchers from Vanderbilt University. The specific aims of the proposed center include: 1. Strengthen the infrastructure to support youth violence prevention research and practice at the University of Louisville. 2. Develop, implement and evaluate a community-level social norming campaign to change the norms of violence among youth in West Louisville using mass and social media. 3. Document the development and implementation of the social norming campaign to improve replication and scalability in other settings or communities. 4. Evaluate the relationship between community readiness, community capacity, and the implementation of the community-level social norming campaign. 5. Disseminate study findings in meaningful and actionable format to a variety of relevant audiences (i.e., community, local organizations and leaders, youth violence prevention researchers and practitioners, academic peers, and policy-makers). The interdisciplinary research team proposes a quasi-experimental design to examine the effectiveness of using a community-level 3-year social norming campaign utilizing new media to change norms of violence among youth 10-24 and introduce prosocial norms driven by cultural identity, with WL as the intervention community and East Nashville, TN as the control community. The researchers and a team of community collaborators will with a professional advertising agency to plan and design the campaign, which will be deployed in Year 2. Surveys and interviews will capture data measuring our dependent variables of social norms and violent behavior (independent variables: campaign exposure by media type, demographics), and population-level youth violence data from schools, emergency departments, and local police departments will offer measures of change in serious youth violence at the population level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intentional injury is the leading cause of death among youth ages 10 to 24 in Kentucky, and the homicide rate in the state for the same age group is 10 times higher for Black males (38.7/100,000) than for White males (3.9/100,000). Youth in West Louisville, a predominantly Black, economically disadvantaged, urban community are subjected to social norms of violence. A targeted community-level social norming campaign holds potential to shift existing norms and reduce serious violence among young people in this community.",Changing the Narrative:  Using Media to Shift Social Norms of Violence Among Youth in West Louisville,9331323,U01CE002711,[''],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,U01,2017,1183594,0.03179384803259817
"Mechanisms of Health Promotion in Diverse Youth Through Gay-Straight Alliances ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth face serious health risks that constitute costly public health concerns. There has been strong documentation of sexual orientation-based disparities on depression, anxiety, and substance use, all of which heighten risk for suicidal ideation and attempts. Further, racial/ethni minority LGBT youth contend with discrimination from multiple marginalized statuses and may face even greater health risks. Yet, there is also a paucity of research on this population. Professional organizations have emphasized the need to consider how social systems contribute to or mitigate health disparities among LGBT populations. Schools are a central access point for resources that may benefit LGBT youth. Few studies, however, have considered school-based programs that address sexual orientation-based health disparities. Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs) - school-based groups in which LGBT and heterosexual youth receive support and advocate for safer schools - have grown exponentially and serve many youth. Yet, they operate without empirically supported strategies. There are virtually no data on how GSA involvement attenuates negative health outcomes or whether youth from other marginalized backgrounds (e.g., racial/ethnic minority youth, either LGBT or heterosexual) derive benefits. There is a pressing need for data in order to develop effective GSA-based interventions and best practices in general. The current project addresses these gaps. This project is among the first to test how GSA involvement is associated with health outcomes through multiple pathways. It takes advantage of multi-informant data from youth and adults and utilizes quantitative and qualitative data. Data will be gathered from 400 GSA-involved youth (both LGBT and heterosexual) and their GSA advisors among a racially and ethnically diverse sample in 40 GSAs, interviews among 32-40 youth stratified across race/ethnicity, and from a nonmember comparison sample from the same schools. The first aim is to rigorously compare GSA members and nonmembers on health and school outcomes by comparing demographically and socially similar youth in the same school and controlling for confounders. The second aim is to capture variability among GSA members by testing mechanisms by which GSA involvement mitigates negative outcomes. The third aim is to identify race/ethnicity-specific GSA factors that mitigate negative outcomes particularly for racial/ethnic minority youth. Given the growing national presence of GSAs, this knowledge stands to benefit many youth by identifying critical factors underlying health promotion and by providing empirically-based recommendations for best practices to maximize GSA effectiveness. Results will provide a foundation for developing and systematically testing GSA-based interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research has the potential for high public health impact to address health concerns among youth from multiple minority groups, including LGBT and racial/ethnic minority youth. It focuses on the ways in which involvement in Gay-Straight Alliances - prominent school-based groups that provide support for these youth - reduces sexual orientation- and race/ethnicity-based health disparities on depression, anxiety, and substance use. This knowledge will be critical for improving health-related interventions among these youth populations.",Mechanisms of Health Promotion in Diverse Youth Through Gay-Straight Alliances,9308727,R01MD009458,"['Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Rural ', ' Gays ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Attenuated ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' System ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' physical assault ', ' physical attack ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' informant ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' comparison group ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional society ', ' professional membership ', ' professional association ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON COLLEGE,R01,2017,420096,0.014106005476114588
"Suicidal trajectories from early adolescence into young adulthood in a national sample PROJECT SUMMARY The impetus for this study rests on the need to understand how suicidal trajectories present from early adolescence into adulthood among a community-based, nationally representative sample. While longitudinal research among adolescent clinical samples has contributed to the literature, they often do not follow adolescents into adulthood and/or include particular higher-risk racial/ethnic groups. Clinical samples also include participants who have already disclosed their suicidal behaviors to professionals. Adolescents, especially particular racial/ethnic minorities, utilize mental health professionals and disclose to trusted adults less than non-Hispanic whites, which arguably heighten risk for suicidal behaviors. No study has tracked longitudinally, a representative sample of suicidal behaviors over the crucial developmental period of adolescence to young adulthood. This study contributes to the literature and aids in public health efforts, as these groups have not reported significant decreases in suicidal behavior in the past 25 years. The study will focus on a salient protective mechanism: developmentally appropriate social relationships. We propose that the heterogeneity of suicidal trajectories will not only help explain suicidal behavior disparities, but will aid in tailoring prevention initiatives based upon the onset of symptomology. This proposed work will create profiles that reflect the variation of suicidal behaviors, based on four independent levels of suicidal risk (1) no suicidal behaviors, (2) suicidal ideation yet no attempts, (3) suicide attempts (4) suicide attempts resulting in medical treatment. This work will examine whether particular profiles not only describe how specific subgroups are at a heightened risk in early adolescence, but also elucidate why some might be chronically suicidal and while others might first present suicidal behaviors later in life. The proposed study will use secondary analysis of the Add Health dataset to 1) describe the longitudinal patterns and progression of suicidal behaviors; 2) examine how social relationships and behavioral health are related to the escalation and de-escalation of suicidal behaviors, and 3) observe the heterogeneity of racial/ethnic and gender presentations in these suicidal behavior trajectories. Profiles will be identified through latent transition analysis. The proposed study will produce recommendations for how pediatricians and other health care providers, as well as educators, particularly in the context of gatekeeping and understanding suicidal risk factors, can support parents and other trusted adults in communicating effectively with their children about suicidal behaviors by (1) identifying which particular subgroups (race/ethnicity, gender and the intersectionality of these identities) are at the most need for upstream prevention messaging; and (2) targeting specific social relationships to capitalize on for help- seeking promotion during times of distress. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gender and racial/ethnic disparities are consistently found among adolescents engaging in suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

"Community Violence and Reproductive Health among Youth in Salinas, California DESCRIPTION: The objective of this study, led by an early-stage investigator building directly on her NICHD K01 research, is to address gaps in research on structural and interpersonal factors in a rural, agricultural community that influence the onset of youth violence and sexual health risks associated with teen pregnancy during the transition from early to middle adolescence. In California, where one in eight U.S. adolescents reside; Latinas maintain the highest teen birth rate, accounting, in 2010, for 41% of the teen population yet 73% of teen births. Adolescent sexual health research has focused primarily on urban youth; however, one in three California teen births are to Latina teens residing in a rural county. Numerous structural and interpersonal (family, peer, partner) factors that shape the risk environment differ between urban and rural communities. Understanding these underlying contexts that contribute to health disparities is vital to achieving substantive improvements in health outcomes. Our NIH-funded research with Latino adolescents in San Francisco over the past 12 years has highlighted a strong connection between community violence and unintended teen pregnancy. Though traditionally regarded as urban, gangs have emerged in many nonurban areas of the United States. This study will take place in Salinas, CA, an agricultural community located in Monterey County on California's central coast. The U.S. Department of Justice named Salinas as one of six high-risk communities nationally for youth gang violence. Monterey County had the sixth highest teen birth rate in 2010 among California's 58 counties. High rates of youth violence and early childbearing in Salinas, California, coupled with entrenched socioeconomic disparities resulting from generations of Mexican migration for agricultural-sector employment, make research to develop appropriate interventions imperative. This context presents an opportunity to examine the relative salience of structural and interpersonal factors to youth violence and reproductive health in a rural county like numerous others throughout central California. This research was initiated by the Monterey County Health Department and has been developed in partnership with an experienced team of NIH investigators. Informed by the Social Ecological Model of Health, we will accomplish our aims through a mixed-methods design that includes formative qualitative research using focus groups, followed by a 2-year prospective cohort study with a random sample of 600 8th grade students, 40 of whom will be selected to complete prospective in-depth interviews. Our aims are to 1) investigate structural and interpersonal factors that are individually and jointly associated with engagement in violent behaviors and sexual health risks among female and male 8th-grade Latino students in Salinas, CA; 2) examine the trajectories of violent behaviors and sexual risk over time, and their interaction, during the transition from 8th grade to 10th grade; and 3) identify structural and interpersonal factors that influence engagement in violent behaviors and sexual health risks during the transition from 8th grade to 10th grade.

"Gender, Autonomy, and Contraceptive Use Among Young People     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career Goals: This is an application for a K01 Career Development Award in Population Research for Ushma Upadhyay, PhD, MPH, a Public Health Social Scientist at the University of California, San Francisco. Her preliminary research focuses on contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy, and includes the development of the first measure of reproductive autonomy, assessing a woman's power to decide about and control matters related to contraceptive use, pregnancy and childbearing. In the short term, she aims to build on this work, investigating the effect of gender-based power on contraceptive use among young people. In the long term, she aspires to conduct research that results in evidence-based interventions that help young people to control their fertility. The knowledge and experience she will gain from the K01 award will prepare her to compete for NICHD R01 funding to design a randomized intervention trial to test the effects of a gender-based power intervention on contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy among adolescents and young people. Environment: The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) provides generous support for junior faculty. UCSF researchers have a long history of pursuing innovative ideas in reproductive health. As an institution, it has been unequivocally supportive of research on contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy. Key Elements of Research Career Development Plan: Dr. Upadhyay has a rich background in epidemiologic and demographic methods, with substantial experience analyzing large datasets. This career development award will enable her to address several remaining gaps in her training specific to her career goals, and to gain applied experience planning and executing a primary data collection study on gender-based power and contraceptive use. Her training goals are to gain experience and expertise in sociological theories of gender among adolescents, qualitative research, advanced quantitative methods, and translating evidence into intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Upadhyay has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team. It includes a Primary Mentor, Tina Raine-Bennett, MD, MPH, a clinician scientist formerly at UCSF who is now Research Director of the Women's Health Research Institute at Kaiser Permanente specializing in adolescent unintended pregnancy and racial disparities, and co-mentor Shari Dworkin, PhD, MS, a medical sociologist in UCSF's Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences and an expert on gender- based power. Her team includes three additional, complementary advisors: Diana Foster, PhD, a demographer in UCSF's Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, who studies the consequences of unintended pregnancy; Torsten B. Neilands, PhD, a quantitative methodologist at UCSF's Center for AIDS Prevention Studies with expertise in latent variable (structural equation) modeling; and Claire Brindis, DrPH, Professor of Pediatrics and Health Policy whose research focuses on adolescent and child health policy, adolescent pregnancy and pregnancy prevention, and adolescent health and risk-taking behaviors. Dr. Upadhyay's training will include a combination of structured reading lists and tutorials with mentors, coursework, self-directed learning, conference presentations and attendance, and seminars. Description of the Research Project: Unintended pregnancy is an important public health problem; half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. The transition to adulthood is a particularly vulnerable period for unintended pregnancy; women ages 15 to 24 are at highest risk. One of the main reasons for unintended pregnancy is lack of consistent contraceptive use. The overall objective of this study is to conduct mentored research that examines the pathways between power, gender norms, and masculinities and contraceptive use among young people ages 15 to 24. My main hypothesis is that adherence to gender norms and traditional norms of masculinity lead to inconsistent and non-use of contraceptives. This research will assess this hypothesis through three specific aims. Aim 1 is to explore the role that relationship power, gender norms, and masculinities have in influencing adolescent and young people's contraceptive use. This aim involves qualitative in-depth interviews with adolescent and young women, men, and couples. Aim 2 is to adapt and validate existing instruments that measure relationship power, gender norms, and masculinities so that they are appropriate for adolescents and young people. This aim involves adapting my own Reproductive Autonomy Scale, the Gender Relations Scale, and the Masculinity Ideology in Relationships Scale for use among adolescents and young men and women. Aim 3 is to determine how relationship power, gender norms, and masculinities impact adolescent and young people's contraceptive use through a 3-month pilot prospective study at an adolescent family planning clinic. Examining gender-based power from the perspectives of multiple disciplines using mixed-methods, I expect to make important contributions in three areas: 1) theory on gender and power and contraceptive use, 2) measurement of gender-based power among adolescents, and 3) potential interventions that reduce unintended pregnancy. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare me for the successful submission of an R01 application to test an adolescent contraceptive use intervention and a research career in gender and power-related determinants of adolescent reproductive health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the United States, over 1.7 million young women ages 15 to 24 have an unintended pregnancy each year, leading to a range of negative health outcomes. The knowledge gained from this study will be used to guide potential interventions to reduce disparities in unintended pregnancy and help achieve the Healthy People 2020 goal of reducing the

"Speaking Their Language: Using Social Media and Texting to Create an Adolescent-Centered Approach to Healthy Weight Gain During Pregnancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tammy Chang, MD, MPH, MS is a family physician and junior clinical investigator focused on reducing obesity among adolescent mothers and their children. Dr. Chang's long-term career objective is to reduce health disparities among low-income adolescent mothers using tailored eHealth technologies. The objective of this K23 mentored career development award includes a 5-year plan for training and research activities that will provide the skills and experiences needed to become a successful independent investigator. RESEARCH CONTEXT: The United States (US) has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the developed world; the majority of pregnant adolescents gain excess weight during pregnancy. Excess pregnancy weight gain has a significant negative impact on the health of the adolescent mother, increases the risk of dangerous complications during delivery, and contributes to long-term obesity for both mother and child. In recognition of this important population health problem, both the IOM and AHRQ have identified the development of interventions targeting excess pregnancy weight gain as a major research priority. Compared to adults, relatively little is known about pregnancy weight gain among adolescents. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand adolescents' perceptions of and knowledge about pregnancy weight gain, so that researchers can customize interventions and make them relevant to the pregnant adolescent. The short-term goal of this proposal is to acquire the requisite skills to develop an adolescent-centered tailored eHealth intervention to reduce excess pregnancy weight gain. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Determine which US pregnant adolescents (aged ≤21 years) are at high risk for significant excess pregnancy weight gain; 2) Identify the baselin knowledge, beliefs, and factors that influence excess pregnancy weight gain among adolescents; and 3) Design and test a scalable healthy diet and exercise eHealth intervention tailored to at-risk pregnant adolescents. RESEARCH PLAN: To accomplish these aims, Dr. Chang will conduct analyses using nationally representative data from the Fragile Families and Wellbeing Study; carry out social media mining and corresponding qualitative interviews with pregnant and postpartum adolescents; and design, implement, and evaluate an adolescent- centered and tailored eHealth (tailored text-messaging) intervention. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Chang will broaden her knowledge of advanced statistical methods using a large nationally representative dataset; develop skills in mining and analyzing online social media data; acquire expertise in designing, implementing, and evaluating scalable interventions tailored to pregnant adolescents; and obtain experience in translating research findings into clinically relevant policies and practices. Dr. Chang's career development goals will be supported through close mentorship from an interdisciplinary team; guidance from an expert advisory panel; advanced didactic course work; attendance at professional meetings and workshops; participation in seminars and journal clubs; guidance in manuscript preparation and grant proposal development for projects arising from the research she conducts as part of this proposal; and implementing her research plan. This training will directly contribute to Dr. Chang's goal of addressing a vital intergenerational problem of excess pregnancy weight gain among at-risk adolescents, as well as the subsequent submission of a successful R01 application. ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Chang's unique resources include a dedicated and accomplished multi-disciplinary mentorship team with whom she has previously collaborated; the outstanding research infrastructure at the University of Michigan and Department of Family Medicine with a particular emphasis on supporting junior investigators; and numerous advanced didactic courses and seminars provided by several distinct academic units at the University of Michigan. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The US has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the developed world, and most pregnant adolescents in the US gain excess weight during pregnancy. Excess weight gain during pregnancy not only has a significant negative impact on the health of the adolescent mother, it increases the risk of dangerous complications during delivery, and contributes to long- term obesity for both mother and child. The overarching goal of this proposal is to promote healthy weight gain among pregnant adolescents by leveraging technologies adolescents use frequently, including online social media and

"Iron Deficiency and Adversity in Early Life and Cardiometabolic Risk in Adulthood ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iron deficiency (ID) is associated with cardiovascular events such as stroke in children and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in adulthood. However, it is unknown whether ID in infancy contributes to the development of CVD and metabolic syndrome (cardio-metabolic risk). Studies of developmental effects of early ID demonstrate long-term negative effects on cognitive functioning, behavior, and socio-emotional development. Such changes may affect health behaviors that increase cardio-metabolic risk. Early adversity (e.g., poverty, maltreatment) is linked to higher cardio-metabolic risk and might also operate through similar cognitive, behavioral, and socio-emotional pathways. As ID is more common in low SES and other disadvantaged circumstances, a yet untested hypothesis is that there is a dual burden of having both ID and early adverse experiences that negatively affects functioning and subsequently increases cardio-metabolic risk. The goal of this project is to understand pathways between early ID and adversity and adult cardio-metabolic risk in order to identify targets for prevention and intervention and to detect subgroups at highest risk for disruptions in functioning and cardio-metabolic health. This goal will be accomplished using data from a large longitudinal study (n > 1000) of the effects of ID from infancy to early adulthood (PIs: Betsy Lozoff and Sheila Gahagan). Information on early ID and adversity (SES, life stress, maternal depression, father absence), adolescent cognitive functioning, health behaviors, and mental health, and adult cardio-metabolic risk (BMI, fat mass, blood pressure, blood lipids, hormonal regulators of metabolism) will be utilized. The first aim will test whether there are indirect effects of early ID on adult cardio-metabolic risk through pathways related to adolescent cognitive functioning, health behaviors, and mental health. The second aim will examine whether early adversity affects cardio-metabolic risk through similar or different pathways. The third aim will examine whether the dual burden of ID and adversity further increases cardio-metabolic risk in adulthood through these adolescent pathways. These aims will be accomplished with a training plan emphasizing the neurobiological and behavioral effects of early ID (sponsor Lozoff), childhood influences on cardio-metabolic risk (co-sponsor Gahagan), early adversity (Lozoff and Gahagan), and advanced statistical methods. Completing this research and training will be the first step in the PI's career plan to conduct policy-relevant research on the impact of nutrition and adversity on mental and physical health throughout the lifespan.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although prior research shows associations between early adversity, cardiovascular disease, and obesity, to date no study has examined whether iron deficiency (ID) early in life, which is more common in adverse environments, contributes to cardiovascular and metabolic risk indirectly through effects in adolescence. The current project tests the novel hypothesis that early ID and adversity increase cardiovascular and metabolic risk in adulthood through alterations in adolescent health behaviors, cognitive functioning, and mental health. If early ID contributes to greater cardiovascular and metabolic risk, especially for individuals experiencing early adversity, iron supplementation for infants in adverse environments may reduce disruptions in adolescent functioning and associated risks for cardiovascular disease and obesity.        ",Iron Deficiency and Adversity in Early Life and Cardiometabolic Risk in

"AN EXAMINATION OF AGE-RELATED DISPARITIES IN MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT AND ASSOCIATED OUTCOMES Abstract The opioid partial agonist buprenorphine (BUP) is a highly effective but vastly under-utilized maintenance treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). Under-utilization of BUP is especially pronounced in the adolescent and young adult populations. For example, only a few percent of adolescents with OUD receive buprenorphine, even though it is FDA-approved for treatment of patients ages 16 and older. Both the American Society for Addiction Medicine and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend BUP treatment for adolescents but emphasize that a stronger evidence base for youth treatment is needed. The objectives of this project are to quantify and characterize age-related disparities in utilization of buprenorphine and other medication assisted treatments (MATs) and to acquire evidence about the effectiveness of MATs among adolescents and young adults with OUDs. Specifically, we will analyze treatment and outcomes data from a commercial insurance claims database with data from more than 50 million privately insured individuals. Using “big data” will allow us to examine MAT patterns even among adolescents, despite low MAT prevalence. The large data set will allow us to acquire knowledge about real-world MAT effectiveness among youth that will complement the limited evidence available from randomized trials. In Aim 1, we will assess the prevalence of MAT among individuals diagnosed with OUD by age, type of treatment, length of treatment (i.e., maintenance vs. detoxification only) and over time. We will examine the demographic and geographic correlates of MAT utilization, with particular emphasis on how prevalence has changed over time and how they might vary by age. We will examine use of different types of medication and medication change patterns (e.g., switching from buprenorphine to naltrexone). This will be an important first step in documenting and characterizing age-related disparities in MAT. In Aim 2, we will compare outcomes of MAT and non-MAT treated youth with OUD. We will use survival analysis to compare time to claims for relapse events. We will examine whether associations between MAT treatment trajectory and relapse outcomes vary by age, contrasting adolescents, young adults, and adults over 25. We will use both conventional propensity score matching and more advanced quasi-experimental methods. The latter analyses will leverage quasi-random variation in MAT prevalence by place and time to compare outcomes among groups of treated individuals with appropriately matched groups from environments where treatment is rare. Execution of this two-year project will be a critical first step toward a marked expansion of the evidence-base for MAT among adolescents and young adults that will provide critical information about promising treatments for a grave public health problem. Project Narrative Only a few percent of adolescents with opioid use disorder receive buprenorphine maintenance treatment even though it is believed to be effective in this age group. Young adults are under-treated as well. One reason for this—particularly in the case of adolescents—may be lack of evidence for effectiveness: There is very little clinical trial data from adolescent populations for buprenorphine or other medication assisted treatments (MAT). This project will use data from a large database of insurance claims to provide the first characterization of MAT patterns among young people with opioid use disorder, and will provide knowledge about real-world MAT effectiveness among youth that will complement the limited evidence available from randomized trials.",AN EXAMINATION OF AGE-RELATED DISPARITIES IN MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT AND ASSOCIATED OUTCOMES,9402388,R21DA044744,"['Academy ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Maintenance ', ' Matched Group ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' detoxification ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Methadone ', ' Methadose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Althose ', ' Adanon ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Naltrexone ', ' ReVia ', ' Nemexin ', ' Nalorex ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Overdose ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Population Density ', ' Public Health ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Opioid ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Agonist ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' age difference ', ' social ', ' Effectiveness ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Older Population ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' economic outcome ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' evidence base ', ' FDA approved ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' medication-assisted treatment ', ' study population ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' Time trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' ']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,228750,0.12252960449626013
"Why Adolescent Latinas Attempt Suicide More than Other Females PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The disparities in suicidal behavior among American teenagers, particularly girls, have been documented now for over two decades. Since 1991, CDC surveys consistently show that adolescent Latinas attempt suicide at rates much higher than any other group of American adolescents. Even with three decades of surveys, no studies have systematically compared Latinas to other girls in order to understand the reasons Latinas’ propensity to suicidal behavior. While family dynamics often account for the suicide attempts of adolescents, we do not know what the qualitative differences in Hispanic family dynamics that influence daughters to attempt suicide more than peers. What, if any, are the substantive differences with non-Hispanic peers? The overarching goal of this developmental/exploratory application is to deepen knowledge of the higher likelihood of Latinas toward suicide attempts (SAs) in contrast to non-Hispanic peers. We will examine the influence of family dynamics on suicidal behavior among Latinas, and contrast the reports of Latinas with those of non-Latina attempters. This study examines intensively family functioning of female suicide attempters of Latino, non-Hispanic White, and African American cultural heritage using in-depth interviews with the girls and the primary female caregiver. Twenty adolescent-caregiver dyads in racial/ethnic groups will be recruited to address two aims: (1) explore the psychological vulnerability of teenage suicide attempters in three racial/ethnic groups and the life contexts that influenced suicidal behaviors. Data on individual susceptibility, viz., emotional vulnerability, family factors, and life context, that girls in each racial/ethnic group indicate influenced the suicide attempts, including thoughts, meanings, and interpretations will generate testable hypotheses about underlying reasons that increase Latina teens’ propensity to suicidal behaviors and why they choose this action; and (2) describe the life histories and trajectories of family dynamics that influenced the attempt for each racial/ethnic group. We will seek answers to such questions as, What are family-adolescent dynamics that shaped the suicidal behavior for each group? To what extent do Latinas’ and caregivers’ histories and trajectories differ from those of the two other racial/ethnic groups? This aim identifies variations in patterns of family dynamics and sociocultural elements that reveal differences in manifestations of suicide attempts across racial/ethnic groups. Achieving these two aims via this mechanism can set the stage for a larger study and inform preventive and intervention programs. PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE For over two decades, national surveys have shown ethnic-racial disparities in suicidal behavior among female adolescents, especially among Latinas, but the reasons for the persistence of these disparities are not known. By comparing the reasons for the suicidal behavior of Latinas with those of African American and non-Hispanic White females, this study will help explain partially why the disparities exist. Findings will be useful to developing efficacious and effective interventions for the prevention of suicide among girls that will reduce disparities in suicidal behaviors.",Why Adolescent Latinas Attempt Suicide More than Other Females,9432389,R21MD012338,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Daughter ', ' Elements ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' family structure/dynamics ', ' Family dynamics ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Interview ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Parents ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Individual ', ' teenage mom ', ' teen mother ', ' teen mom ', ' adolescent mother ', ' teenage mother ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' suicidal ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' life history ', ' intervention program ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' girls ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Seminal ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' risk behavior in youth ', ' adolescent risk taking ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' ethnographic method ', ' family influence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' suicide attempter ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2017,224418,0.08132343660653496
"Treatment for Latino/a Adolescents with Suicidal Behavior DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching career goal of Yovanska Duarte-Velez, Assistant Research Scientist, at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras Campus (UPR-RP), is to become an independent mental health researcher in clinical interventions for suicidal adolescents and their families, with a specialization in Latino populations. One of her future objectives is to conduct multisite clinical trials of innovative treatments in Puerto Rico ad the United States. Her specific career goals are: 1) develop research skills to conduct randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in real world settings with high risk adolescents; 2) develop research skills to conduct cross-cultural and health disparity research in multisite studies; 3) gain knowledge of procedures to assess observable family variables and neurobehavioral and neurocognitive markers that may prove to be underlying mechanisms of change in treatment outcomes for suicidal adolescents and incorporate these measures in treatment research; and 4) improve knowledge of and gain experience with statistical analyses used in treatment research. These goals will be achieved through: 1) Drs. Spirito (RCT with suicidal adolescents) and Bernal's (Latino mental health) mentorship; 2) consultations with Drs. Canino (multisite & cross-cultural research), Alegria (health disparities & cross-cultural research), Goldston (intervention development), Stout (statistical methods) and Dickstein (neurobehavioral and neurocognitive mechanisms); 3) courses, seminars, workshops, and special training; and 4) execution of the proposed research project. The proposed award will be carried out at Brown University for the first two years and at UPR-RP for the last three years. The primary aim of the proposed research is to evaluate the feasibility of a socio-cognitive-behavioral therapy protocol for suicidal behavior (SCBT-SB protocol) with Latino/a adolescents. The Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) treatment protocol will include developmental and cultural factors in order to optimize treatment outcomes in suicidal Latino/a adolescents. Specifics aims are: 1) refine the treatment protocol to expand its applicability to Latino population in U.S. based on feedback from therapists working with Latino and suicidal adolescents in RI and on a small open trial; 2) develop and implement a training program for the protocol; and 3) conduct a pilot RCT of the SCBT-SB versus treatment as usual (TAU). This proposed project's public health significance is evident, as it addresses two Healthy People 2020 Objectives: MHMD HP2020-1: ""Reduce the suicide rate"" and MHMD HP-2: ""Reduce the rate of suicide attempts by adolescents."" Its clinical significance lies in the fact that there is little evidence of treatment efficacy for suicidal adolescents and there are evident disparities in the delivery of quality clinical services for Latio populations. Its scientific significance is that it tests the feasibility of a novel treatment apprach that aims to incorporate new perspectives relevant to Latino families and minority youth. It also addresses the third strategic objective of the NIMH, which is to: ""Develop new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illness."" PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Culturally sensitive treatment for suicidal minority youth and clinical investigators devoted to high suicide risk and underserved population are nearly absent. The proposed training grant allows Dr. Duarte-Velez to gain expertise in treatment development according to the needs and challenges faced by suicidal minority youths (e.g. ethnic, sexual) and their families. The primary aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the feasibility of a novel cognitive behavioral treatment protocol that integrates developmental and cultural factors to target suicidal behavior in Latino/a adolescents.",Treatment for Latino/a Adolescents with Suicidal Behavior,9334299,K23MH097772,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Adolescent Behavior ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Award ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Consultations ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Legal Guardians ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentorship ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Piedra ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Competence ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' preference ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Reporting ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' protocol development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Clinical Services ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' acronyms ', ' pilot trial ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' suicidal adolescent ', ' suicidal youth ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' reducing suicide ', ' reducing suicidality ', ' reduce suicide ', ' reduce suicidality ', ' follow up assessment ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Research Assistant ', ' high-risk adolescents ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' ']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,155626,0.09750472314482563
"Adolescent Social Risks and Resources and Young Adult Health PROJECT SUMMARY The substantial social and developmental changes of adolescence make it a period laden with social risks. Adolescents often do not have the cognitive capacities and emotional maturity to effectively cope on their own. Consequently, they must draw on others for help. Building on theoretical and practical knowledge of life course processes and later life implications of early social risk, understanding how and why adolescents accumulate risk over the long term or utilize resources in their social lives to recover from risk in the short term can potentially provide key theoretical insights into risk and resilience. The specific aims of the project are to: (1) identify adolescents who recover from early social risks to become healthy adults and those who follow a pattern of accumulating risks through young adulthood that undermine their adult health; (2) investigate complex biological processes associated with adolescents' health responses to social risks and resources; and (3) examine racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and gender disparities in longitudinal linkages among social risks, resources, and health. To accomplish these aims, this project will apply advanced statistical techniques to long-term longitudinal data inside and outside the body from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). The project will exploit the rich multi- method data collection in Add Health (e.g., surveys, networks, transcripts, biomarkers) and build on some of the most innovative uses of Add Health data (e.g., measuring course sequences with transcripts and examining early-life precursors to disease). The results of this research can identify adolescents who are most vulnerable to the cumulative effects of social risk. It may also inform programmatic efforts to reduce the immediate risks to mortality during the adolescent years, which are of such great concern, and to break the translation of early disadvantages into long-term mental and physical problems, which is increasingly seen as crucial to promoting adult health. The fellowship period includes activities and training to support the development of extant skills and building of new ones (e.g., conceptualization and operationalization of biosocial processes, life course frameworks and methods, longitudinal modeling, statistical approaches to the genome). The three fellowship years will include formal and informal mentoring, training in specific methodological and theoretical approaches (particularly as related to integrating biological and social pathways to health), and support in professionalization and networking. By engaging in the training plan proposed, the applicant will be well-suited for a productive career as a faculty member at a top-tier research institution. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall objective of this research is to understand how and why adolescents accumulate risk over the long term or tap into social resources to recover from risk in the short term—digging down into the biology of this phenomenon and contextualizing it in larger systems of social stratification. Addressing the project aims will build theoretical and practical knowledge to break the translation of early disadvantages into long-term mental and physical problems that is increasingly seen as crucial to promoting adult health. Moreover, research is of high policy relevance because it will identify critical points of intervention for adolescents facing social risks and will elucidate programmatic social resources that might be leveraged to promote resilience.",Adolescent Social Risks and Resources and Young Adult Health,9328490,F32HD091959,"['facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Genome ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Medical Sociology ', ' medicine sociology ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Social Network ', ' career ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Failure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Lepus ', ' Hares ', ' Policies ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' tool ', ' German population ', ' German ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' experience ', ' social integration ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' developmental psychology ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Skin ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Biosocial ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biodemography ', ' population health ', ' health data ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' career networking ', ' speed networking ', ' professional networking ', ' career fair ', ' course sequence ', ' training opportunity ', ' adolescent health ', ' gender disparity ', ' symptomatology ', ' Social stratification ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Weight ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Buffers ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Data Collection ', ' Demographer ', ' Demography ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Continuance of education ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Environment ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F32,2017,24821,0.1310079499411855
"Multilevel Protective Factors For LGB Youth In North America DESCRIPTION: A growing body of literature demonstrates dramatic disparities in health between lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) and heterosexual youth, including problem substance use, HIV risk behaviors and suicide. In 2011 the Institute of Medicine called for additional research with this population, prioritizing health disparities research as ""essential for building  solid evidence base"" in LGB heath. The IOM report highlights the importance of multilevel social influences on the lives of LGB people, specifying the role of social structures such as families, schools, workplaces, religious institutions and community organizations as critical subjects of study to expand our understanding of the determinants of health in this population.  The proposed R01 led by a new investigator in response to PA-12-111, directly addresses this need. The goal of this study is to broaden and deepen our understanding of the family, peer, school and community environments that protect young LGB people from involvement in high risk health behaviors, including substance use, HIV risk behaviors and suicide behaviors. This research aims to 1) develop a theoretically grounded approach to promoting health among LGB adolescents based on in-depth knowledge of their community and school environments, and 2) link environmental data, collected using the Inventory, with existing population-based student data to identify factors at the individual, family, peer, school and community levels that protect LGB youth from involvement in health risk behaviors. ""Go-along"" interviews with 72 youth in diverse locations will be used to elicit in-depth information on LGB adolescents' perceptions of supportive elements in their schools and communities; this information, in conjunction with published literature, expert review, and psychometric testing, will be used to create an LGB Environment Inventory to characterize policies, programs, resources and other supports for LGB youth that exist in these settings. The Inventory will then be used to measure indicators of support in 120 communities in Minnesota, British Columbia and Massachusetts, using publicly available materials (e.g. websites) and brief contacts with key informants (Aim 1). These community-level data will then be linked with existing student survey data from approximately 3,600 LGB adolescents in these same communities, which will include information about family, peer and individual supports, as well as health behaviors and demographic information (Aim 2). The following hypotheses will be tested: a) higher LGB environment scores for the community and school will be protective against health risk behaviors among LGB youth; b) greater family connectedness and support and a more supportive peer environment will be protective against health risk behaviors among LGB youth, and c) family, peer and individual-level factors will moderate the associations between the LGB environment (community and school) and the health risk behaviors of interest. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application for a mixed methods study using a social ecological approach is directly responsive to the 2011 IOM report and the NIH's call for research to advance the health of LGB populations. Findings from this innovative work will indicate specific features of the LGB environment which are protective against health risk behaviors and poor outcomes, and specific subgroups of LGB young people to be targeted for maximum impact. Interventions will build on these insights to increase supports for LGB youth in their families, among their peers, at their schools and in their communities, ultimately extending their protective benefits across the LGB youth population and reducing health disparities.",Multilevel Protective Factors For LGB Youth In North America,9244829,R01HD078470,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' British Columbia ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Literature ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' North America ', ' Perception ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Students ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Family member ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Workplace ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Review Literature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Study Subject ', ' binge drinking ', ' episodic drinking ', ' binge alcohol consumption ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' informant ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' collaborative environment ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' school district ', ' family support ', ' illicit drug use ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2017,419851,0.019957808915267536
"Prevention of Adolescent Risky Behaviors: Neural Markers of Intervention Effects Adolescence is a time of dramatic biological, behavioral and social changes. It is one of the healthiest periods of the life-span, yet morbidity and mortality rates increase 200%, often attributed to natural tendencies to explore and take risks that increase vulnerability to risky and dangerous behaviors. Rapid advances in developmental neuroscience are revealing new insights into how biology and social context interact to increase adolescents' risk-taking behavior which is attributed to a temporal disassociation between maturational changes in two distinct neural systems: “socio-emotional” (reward) and “cognitive-control” (self-regulation). The socio-emotional system is stimulated by a rapid increase in dopaminergic activity at puberty, which influences reward-seeking behavior. This increase in reward-seeking precedes the maturation of the cognitive-control system and its connections to the reward system. This proposal aims to apply these new insights on neurobiology of adolescents' responses to alcohol/drug use and sex-related risk opportunities by examining brain changes in response to a theoretically- based and empirically-tested prevention program that targets risky behavior in African-American youth during pubertal transition. This racial group is disproportionately affected by the high morbidity and mortality associated with HIV-related risky behaviors and exemplifies a significant health disparity in our society. The intervention was designed on the basis of developmental issues and socio-cultural contextual processes germane to African- American families, and has been shown in randomized controlled trials to delay/deter HIV-related risky behaviors in this vulnerable population. This proposal extends the efficacy studies of the intervention by using functional magnetic resonance imaging to quantify the biological changes in response to the intervention. Identifying neural substrates of the intervention can facilitate refinement of the program by focusing on the components that are most effective in changing behavioral and neural circuitry and also aid in the development of new interventions for subgroups of youth that don't have a positive outcome. Using a randomized controlled design, we will assess the neural substrates of risk-taking and risk-avoidant behavior before and after the 6-week computer-interactive, family-based intervention in 11-13 year-old African-American youth. Psychological processes shown to mediate the intervention effects on behaviors that dissuade alcohol and drug use and sexual onset (i.e. reward-drive and cognitive-emotional self-regulation) will be assessed at baseline and 3 months post-intervention. Based on prior studies that reported observable brain changes in response to psychosocial interventions, our hypothesis is that a positive response to the intervention will be associated with greater functional connectivity changes between the socio-emotional (reward-drive) and cognitive-control (self-regulation) components of the neural circuitry compared to the control condition, both at rest and during task-performance. We also postulate that these neural changes will mediate the intervention's positive effects on psychological processes involved in youth's decision to avoid HIV-risk vulnerability behaviors in the service of long-term personal goals and positive health outcomes. Adolescence is a time of biological and behavioral changes that can lead to risky and dangerous behaviors, and African-American youth are highly vulnerable to the consequences of risky behavior, including HIV/AIDS and violence, leading to premature death. We previously showed that an intervention program reduces HIV-risk vulnerability behaviors in many African-American youth. We aim to measure how the program affects different regions of the brain in order to better prevent or reduce such risky behaviors among African-American youth.",Prevention of Adolescent Risky Behaviors: Neural Markers of Intervention Effects,9251573,R01DA040966,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Biology ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Computers ', ' Dangerous Behavior ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Family ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Predicting Suicide Risk in Sexual Minority and Nonminority Youth: Associations Among Neural Sensitivity to Social Rejection, Peer Rejection, and Suicidality ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a need for research that can help better predict risk and prevent suicide among adolescent youth. Rates of suicidality, a strong predictor of suicide, are higher among adolescent girls compared to boys, and highest among sexual minority girls (girls who endorse same-sex romantic attraction, behavior or identity). This study tests an innovative model of suicide risk in a sample of sexual minority and nonminority adolescent girls that integrates neurobehavioral and interpersonal vulnerabilities. Specifically, the model posits that neural sensitivity to social rejection, when occurring in the presence of peer rejection, increases risk for suicide. This proposed K01 bridges the candidate's prior training in interpersonal risk for depression and developmental psychopathology, with new training in affective neuroscience and suicide risk. This training will uniquely position the candidate to investigate the development of negative valence systems, with an emphasis on affective sensitivity to social rejection, and associations with suicidality. Thus, the proposed study will be the first in a larger program of research that will contribute to NIMH research priorities, such as Strategic Objective 2, by investigating how individual differences in biologic and social/environmental factors contribute to heterogeneity in the development of suicide risk in diverse populations. Specifically, the candidate plans to follow the proposed study with larger longitudinal studies using multiple methods and repeated assessments of neurobehavioral and interpersonal vulnerability for suicide during the adolescent developmental period to examine 1) how pain related neural circuitry underlying affective sensitivity to social rejection may be associated with suicide risk, and 2) interpersonal factors (e.g., interpersonal rejection) that may contribute to and strengthen sensitivity to social rejection over time within the context of social and pubertal changes in adolescence. The candidate will also be positioned to investigate etiological models explaining elevated suicide risk among sexual minority youth. This program of research is expected to advance the field by improving the ability to predict risk for suicide among vulnerable youth, and to identify targets for intervention during optimal developmental windows.  To achieve these career objectives, the candidate will receive training in developmental affective neuroscience, neuroimaging methods, and theory and research on development of suicide risk in adolescence, including sexual minority youth. She has an ideal mentorship team within an optimal scientific training environment to provide the requisite training for her to meet her career goals. Dr. Jennifer Silk is an expert on development of social-emotional processing from childhood into adolescence. Dr. Mary Phillips has significant expertise in affective neuroscience and fMRI methods, and neural underpinnings of emotional reactivity and regulation. Dr. Michael Marshal provides expertise on suicidality disparities between sexual minority and nonminority youth. Additional mentorship and support from consultants will provide training in the role of pain neural circuitry underlying the affective experience of social rejection (i.e. ""social pain"", Dr. Naomi Eisenberger), and the development of suicide risk in adolescents (Dr. David Brent) and new methods to assess suicide risk (Dr. Matt Nock). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents in the U.S., and suicide rates increase markedly during the transition from childhood to adolescence. The study will be the first in a larger program of research designed to investigate how the RDoC domain for negative valence systems is linked to suicide by investigating how aspects of the physical pain system involved in affective responses to social rejection and loss may influence risk for suicide, and how exposure to rejection experiences may amplify risk for suicide among vulnerable youth. Knowledge gained from this research will inform 1) what interventions should be used for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, such as the potential use of neuromodulatory interventions currently used to treat physical pain conditions, 2) who is in need of these interventions, such as youth with heightened affective sensitivity to social rejection, and 3) when to use these interventions, such as after social rejection experiences during the adolescent developmental period.","Predicting Suicide Risk in Sexual Minority and Nonminority Youth: Associations Among Neural Sensitivity to Social Rejection, Peer Rejection, and Suicidality",9297386,K01MH109850,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cause of Death ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Interview ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Social Development ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Somatosensory Cortex ', ' somesthetic sensory cortex ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Silk ', ' Friends ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' career ', ' Friendships ', ' improved ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' Marshal ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' social separation ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' emotional distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Brain region ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' High Prevalence ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' peer victimization ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' suicide model ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' neural model ', ' Affective ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' sexual minority ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Negative Valence ', ' Same-sex ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2017,159743,0.00619708328218947
"ACTION PAC: Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition & Physical Activity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The childhood obesity epidemic has led to the rising prevalence of cardiometabolic risks in adolescents. These risks include abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and pre-diabetes, the clustering of which is known as metabolic (or insulin resistance) syndrome. Longitudinal data show that children and adolescents with metabolic syndrome are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes. This is especially worrisome for youth in New Mexico, a culturally diverse state with 44.9% Hispanics and 9.7% American Indians, because obesity disproportionately affects these populations. School-based health centers (SBHCs) offer an important venue to expand healthcare access for adolescents, who are traditionally hard-to- reach. SBHCs provide health services to all students, with a focus on the uninsured and underserved and may be the only point of intervention for low-income and minority youth. The proposed R01 study will build upon significant findings from a NIH/NHLBI funded R21 study that utilized a community-based participatory research approach to develop and pilot-test a SBHC weight management program called Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition and Physical Activity (ACTION) with two high schools. ACTION was based on the use of motivational interviewing (MI) to support adoption of healthier eating and physical activity behaviors. In this current proposal (ACTION PAC), we propose to collaborate with eight high schools that have SBHCs to evaluate the broader reach and efficacy of using MI-based approaches to prevent and treat overweight/obesity and to decrease the risk of metabolic syndrome development. Specifically, our goals are to 1) prevent the development of overweight and obesity among students with BMI <85th percentile, 2) reduce BMI z score and insulin resistance in students with BMI >=85th percentile, and 3) obtain student and parent feedback on their experience with school-based BMI screening and weight management. To test the efficacy of these MI-based approaches, we will employ a cluster randomized control trial design in which four of the eight high schools will be randomized to an intervention group and the other four high schools will be randomized to a usual care comparison group. 960 participants in the 9th and 10th grades between the ages of 14-17 years will be followed annually for two years (until their 11th and 12th grade, respectively). Analyses will be conducted in a multilevel framework to account for clustering within schools. Baseline and 2nd year comparisons within group and comparison of change between the intervention and comparison groups will be assessed. The collective impact of these research outcomes will advance the field of school-based obesity intervention studies and take a significant step towards identifying sustainable prevention and treatment approaches for adolescent obesity and metabolic syndrome through the use of SBHCs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Healthy People 2020 has set objectives to: 1) increase the proportion of health care providers who regularly assess body mass index (BMI) in their adolescent patients, 2) increase the proportion of health care visits that include counseling related to nutrition, weight and physical activity, 3) reduce the proportion of adolescents who are obese, 4) prevent inappropriate weight gain in youth, 5) improve adolescent diet to include more fruits, vegetable and whole grains and less fats and added sugars, and 6) increase the proportion of adolescents who are physically active. The proposed project, ACTION PAC (Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition and Physical Activity), will address all of the above objectives by evaluating a method to motivate high school students to eat healthier, be physically active and achieve or maintain a healthy weight. Primary health care providers in school-based health centers will assess adolescents' BMI and work with them to adopt healthier behaviors to prevent access weight gain and assist those who are overweight or obese with weight management.",ACTION PAC: Adolescents Committed to Improvement of Nutrition & Physical Activity,9318544,R01HL118734,"['sweetened beverage ', ' Minority ', ' therapy

"The Social Context of Adolescent Marijuana Use: A Systems Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The continued rise in adolescent marijuana use and the limited effectiveness of interventions to prevent adolescent marijuana use may be due to the failure to recognize the complexity of peer relationships, including developmental shifts in the prominence of peers vs. romantic partners, changes within romantic relationships, and the interconnected relationship between peers and romantic partners, that lead to the uptake, continuation, and escalation of adolescent marijuana use. The candidate is an epidemiologist, who has been well trained in linear modeling and brings an understanding of the role of partner context on risk behaviors (i.e. condom use and concurrency). To become a successful independent investigator with a career focused on addressing the significant and complex problem of adolescent marijuana use, the candidate requires additional training on the etiology and trajectories of marijuana use and dependence, the development and impact of romantic and peer relationships on decision-making around health compromising behaviors, formal and practical training in complex System Dynamics and mathematical modeling, and a deep understanding of legal and ethical issues associated with adolescent substance use research. The long-term goals of the candidate are to become an independent investigator focused on improving adolescent health by identifying opportunities for health promotion and developmentally appropriate primary drug use prevention strategies. Marijuana use is a significant public health problem due to the breadth of health and social consequences associated with its use. Adolescent marijuana use may be an intractable problem because it is embedded in a complex system. The short-term goals of the candidate are to gain the knowledge and skills to apply a systems science approach to illuminate how the context of romantic relationships drives adolescents' uptake, continuation and escalation of marijuana use. To attain these short- and long-term goals, the training component of the award includes 4 activities: 1) develop expertise in the etiology, physiology and trajectories of adolescent and young adult marijuana abuse and dependence, 2) build a theoretical foundation of sexual, dating and romantic relationships over the course of heterosexual adolescent and young adult development, 3) gain advanced skills in systems science methods, including group model building and mathematical modeling, and 4) gain an understanding of the complex ethical issues involved in drug use research with vulnerable adolescents and young adults. The research component of the award is to quantify the influence of romantic partners on adolescent marijuana use, and to use systems science methodology to incorporate important complexities of peer socialization processes. Specific Aim 1 is to use longitudinal data to estimate the contribution of romantic partner and non-romantic peer influence on adolescent marijuana use. This knowledge will serve as the foundation for developing a quantitative System Dynamics model, which will examine whether there is an effect of romantic partners and the relative magnitude of romantic partners and non-romantic peer influence on frequency of adolescent marijuana use over time. Specific Aim 2 is to use participatory model building (e.g., convened group of multidisciplinary academic and community experts and a group of youth) to create a system diagram incorporating key components of the social system that drive an adolescent's uptake, continuation and escalation of marijuana use over time using an approach grounded in rich theory from diverse disciplines. Specific Aim 3 is to use the system diagram to develop a quantitative simulation model of peer system effects on marijuana use and calibrate the model with available data, including the empirical literature. Upon completion of this award, the candidate will become a productive investigator who has the necessary skills to conduct innovative and compelling interdisciplinary research focused on the etiology of drug use in adolescents. She will understand how social context, specifically the dynamic nature of adolescent romantic and non-romantic peer relationships, affects marijuana use. Model building may help identify feedback loops in the peer system that perpetuates disparities in health and social consequences. Findings from this work may identify leverage points in the system that may be novel, multi-disciplinary and ideally more modifiable than previously identified prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescent marijuana use is a significant health problem and is currently on the rise. Peers, romantic and non- romantic, are known to be great influences of marijuana use. The goal of this project is to incorporate important complexities of the peer influence process to understand how social context, specifically the dynamic nature of adolescent romantic and non-romantic peer relationships, affects adolescent marijuana use.",The Social Context of Adolescent Marijuana Use: A Systems Approach,9246512,K01DA035387,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Cannabis Dependence ', ' Marijuana Dependence ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Marijuana Abuse ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Physiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Socialization ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Social Network ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Discipline ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' uptake ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' peer ', ' intimate behavior ', ' intimacy ', ' member ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Legal ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' youth substance use ', ' substance use among adolescents ', ' adolescent substance use ', ' time use ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' peer influence ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' vulnerable adolescent ', ' Adolescent marijuana use ', ' marijuana use in adolescence ', ' marijuana use among adolescents ', ' cannabis use among adolescents ', ' marijuana use ', ' cannabis use ', ' model building ', ' adolescent health ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,184734,0.13356175825580957
"Biopsychosocial Pathways Linking Discrimination and Adolescent Health PROJECT SUMMARY Incidents of discrimination are part of the everyday life experiences of adolescents of color, and although many studies document the negative psychological and academic repercussions of discrimination, we know almost nothing about how discrimination gets under the skin to influence adolescent health. Yet it is precisely these processes that could initiate racial/ethnic health disparities observed in adult populations, and adolescence is the key time to study these processes since the social-cognitive ability to recognize discriminatory treatment emerges in the second decade of life. My proposed project targets biodemography and the biopsychosocial pathways by which discrimination influences adolescent health and well-being. I have two primary aims for my K01 award: 1) gain extensive training in biodemography that will build my expertise as a population dynamics scholar and 2) test a biopsychosocial model of racial/ethnic discrimination using secondary data from three population-based studies with young adult samples and primary data from collected from adolescents. These aims will allow me to achieve my long-term career goals of a) enhancing interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in my department around population dynamics and biomarkers across the lifespan and b) developing an R01 grant that tests a larger biopsychosocial model that integrates what I learn in my K01 award with an examination of potential buffers that might protect adolescents from the pernicious effects of discrimination. My primary mentor for the K01 award is demographer Mark Hayward, with biobehavioral psychologist Elizabeth Susman, adolescent health nursing professor Lynn Rew, and health psychologist Velma McBride Murry serving as co-mentors. My career development plan includes frequent mentoring meetings, off- site training sessions and conferences, on-site coursework, biomarker and health field and lab experiences, and R01 application preparation. This training plan is critical for my research study that focuses on three aims: 1) investigate the biopsychosocial pathways linking perceptions of discrimination to mental and physical health, 2) examine how SES and SES marginalization contribute to the biopsychosocial pathways of interest, and 3) assess the degree to which gender and pubertal development condition the biopsychosocial pathways. The research study includes analyses of population data from the NSAL, NLAAS, and Add Health along with primary data collected from 100 participants (drawn from a larger study that I am conducting) who report experiencing various constellations of racial/ethnic discrimination. This training and research agenda fits squarely within the growing subfield of biodemography, where biological insights are being integrated into models of population health and health dynamics. My training and my foundation of empirical research leave me well-situated to pursue this critical line of inquiry, but I can only do so with the career development provided by this K01 award. Receiving the K01 award would contribute substantially to my intellectual development, my research skills, and my ability to become an independent biodemographer and population dynamics scholar. PROJECT NARRATIVE Investigation of biopsychosocial processes, particularly those revolving around discrimination, are crucial to developing a well-rounded understanding of the etiology of racial/ethnic health disparities and to identifying new and innovative policy interventions. This study examines the biopsychosocial pathways that link experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination to adolescents' mental and physical health and well-being, and career development in biodemography and population dynamics is critical for undertaking this research. Capturing the vulnerability that Americans of color face in a more multifaceted and comprehensive way than in past research is important to both theorizing about and taking action on racial/ethnic health disparities in the population.",Biopsychosocial Pathways Linking Discrimination and Adolescent Health,9242920,K01HD087479,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', '

"Enhanced Intervention to Improve Adolescent Outcomes: A Clinical Trial ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited access to care is a major contributor to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and unintended pregnancy for U.S. adolescents and contributes to significant health disparities, including rates of STIs that are 6-7 times higher for uninsured youths than for insured youths. Racial/ethnic disparities also exist, with African American and Hispanic adolescents evidencing    pregnancy rates that are 4 times higher than White youths. The emergency department (ED) represents an important but underutilized location for reaching large numbers of sexually at-risk adolescents with limited access to evidence-based care and there is growing support for use of the ED to improve adolescent sexual health outcomes. Because few proven interventions are available in the ED to motivate youth to safer sexual behavior and provide health services (e.g., STI testing, condoms), novel interventions are needed. Dr. Miller, a pediatric emergency medicine physician and the candidate for this Career Development Award, is committed    to conducting patient-oriented behavioral research to improve adolescent health outcomes, focusing on underserved communities. Together with a strong multi-disciplinary mentorship team, Dr. Miller has created a four-year career development plan which includes structured mentoring, completion of a Master of Science in Clinical Research, and focused training in the use of health behavior change theories to develop multi-level interventions, research methods and statistical analyses for behavioral intervention trials, effective counseling strategies for health behavior change, health care system and payment models, and responsible conduct of    research. Dr. Miller's training activities will be complemented by an innovative project that will facilitate practical application of these new skills. The goal of the project is to enhance and tes a previously piloted ED SexHealth intervention that uses a dedicated health educator to provide risk reduction counseling, point-of care health services, and referral for ongoing care. Following intervention refinement, Dr. Miller will conduct a randomized trial of the enhanced intervention versus a standard information arm to determine the effect size of rates of health service uptake and enhanced intervention feasibility. We hypothesize that the intervention will result in higher health service uptake and increased condom use versus a standard information arm. The    rationale is that it will produce the first controlled data on an intervention designed to improve adolescent sexual health outcomes using a novel and effective method of delivering care. We expect to use these critical effect size estimates to inform the design of a larger clinical trial o evaluate efficacy. Dr. Miller's training efforts will culminate in the submission of an R01 proposa to fund this trial. This training and research plan are consistent with the mission of the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Healthy People 2020 objectives from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and the 2009 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and unintended pregnancy are costly public health problems that disproportionately affect adolescents, particularly those with limited access to care. Emergency department-based sexual health interventions have potential to reach large    numbers of high-risk youth, but effective interventions are lacking.

"Life-course pathways linking adolescent childbearing to chronic conditions: A pilot study to reinforce research and health system capacity in Northeast Brazil Project Summary: This project has two principal objectives: 1) Improve health system and research capacity in the community of Santa Cruz, which is located in the region of Northeast Brazil and 2) Apply that capacity in order to conduct epidemiological research investigating pathways that may explain how and why adolescent childbirth is associated to chronic conditions and mobility loss in middle-aged and older women. Such information is vital to developing preventative public health interventions to address non-communicable diseases across the life-course. Lessons learned from this research would add to the research evidence-base for policy and action on adolescent pregnancy and, more broadly, women's health in Latin America. Specifically, this project aims to: 1) Train students from the Santa Cruz campus of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (Brazil) to conduct epidemiological interviews, collect biological samples, and take anthropometric and clinical measures. It will also provide in-depth, specialized training on ethical research conduct when working with pregnant and adolescent women; 2) Develop and validate epidemiological questionnaires adapted to a low-education, rural, adolescent, Portuguese-speaking population; 3) Prospectively follow a pilot cohort of adolescent and adult women, pregnant for the first time, from the 1st trimester of pregnancy to 6-weeks postpartum. This pilot would collect questionnaire data (baseline), clinical measurements, and biomarker concentrations (baseline, 3rd trimester, 6-weeks postpartum). The proposed pilot study, which is the 3rd study aim, will lay the foundation for a more expansive and comprehensive research program investigating hypothesized mechanisms behind previously documented associations between adolescent childbirth and poor later-life health. Overall, the capacity built and sustained from this project will contribute to advancing health research in one of the most underserved regions of Brazil. It will provide training to the next generation of Brazilian researchers and establish long-term networks between Brazilian and United States researchers.   This proposed study will examine the long-term effects of adolescent pregnancy, such as disease and disability, among women in Northeast Brazil, a population that suffers from economic, gender, and health inequities at a higher rate than those in urban areas in Brazil. This will include collaborating with the newly-established Santa Cruz campus of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte to build their infrastructure and training capacity to carry out public

"The Role of Place on the Co-occurrence of ATOD Use and Violence Among Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Mentored Scientist Career Development Award (K01) that provides me the training and research experience necessary to develop an innovative research program focused on ATOD use and violent/aggressive behavior among youth. My research and professional career have focused on vulnerable populations of young people living in communities characterized by substantial health and social disparities. My primary research interest focuses on resiliency in the prevention of ATOD use and violent behavior among at-risk urban adolescents and young adults. This research interest stems from my experience as a Nurse Practitioner in school-based and community-based clinics with adolescents and young adults. To date, my program of research has focused on the healthy development of adolescents and prevention of risk behaviors, particularly youth violence. My long-term goal is to become an independent investigator in the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violent/aggressive behavior among youth, and the role of primitive factors in the healthy development of youth, specifically primitive factors within the neighborhood context (place). With my long- term goal in mind, my training and research objectives for the five-year award period are: 1) To develop expertise in ATOD use, the relationship between ATOD use and violent behavior, and their concomitant individual and neighborhood risk and primitive factors; 2) To expand my quantitative skills to examine for the effect of place (neighborhood) on adolescent ATOD use and the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence/aggression overtime; 3) To develop skills in intervention development, evaluation, and design; and 4) To advance my knowledge of the ethical conduct of intervention research with adolescents, including considerations regarding recruitment, data collection, management and security, and intervention. Training will include: graduate coursework in spatial-temporal analysis; short courses in intervention development and design and advanced multilevel modeling; mentored literature reviews on youth ATOD use, ATOD use and violence, and neighborhood effects of substance use among youth; participation in substance use interdisciplinary workgroups and meetings; mentorship in developing school and community partnerships for intervention research and translating research findings into interventions; and three mentored research projects. I will be mentored by experts in adolescent development, adolescent substance use, spatial analysis, and intervention development and implementation. Guided by a developmental-ecological perspective, I have proposed two secondary data analysis projects and one data collection project to address the following overarching research aims: 1) To examine the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence/aggression among urban youth; 2) To explore how place influences the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence; 3) To examine the relationship between future orientation, place, and the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence during adolescence; and 4) To develop an intervention and relevant measures that will be the basis for an R21 and future RCT R01. Using data from the NIDA-funded longitudinal Flint Adolescent Study (n = 850, PI: Zimmerman), the first project will focus on the trajectories of ATOD use and violent behavior over time, and will identify neighborhood characteristics that influence trajectories of ATOD use and violent behavior in a sample of urban youth. I will use dual trajectory growth curve analysis and cross-legged path analyses to explore the relationship between ATOD use and violence from age 14-32. Multilevel modeling analyses will be used to identify neighborhood characteristics that influence the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence. Using data from a county-wide school based survey (Coordinated Community Student Survey; C2S2); the second research project will focus on the relationship between future orientation, place, and the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violent behavior. I will use multi-group, multilevel SEM (ML-SEM) to examine differences in the relationship between future orientation and ATOD use/violent behavior based on neighborhood factors. The third study involves conducting a survey with a subsample of C2S2 youth (n = 500 6th grade students) for a more in-depth exploration of the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violent behavior, future orientation and its relationship to ATOD and violent behavior, and how place influence future orientation and ATOD use and violent behavior in a sample of urban youth. Measures, study design, and analyses will be determined based on knowledge, skills, and mentoring received as part of the training plan. In research projects 2 and 3, I will use spatial analytic techniques to examine the effects of place-based risk and primitive factors on future orientation, youth ATOD use and violence. In the proposed projects, I seek to identify place-based assets and resources that are associated with preventing the co-occurrence of ATOD use and violence and promote the development of future orientation. In collaboration with school/community partners, I will use these findings to develop an intervention focused on promoting health youth development and reducing ATOD use and violent behavior during year 4, and I will submit an R21 to test this intervention during year 5. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug use and violent behavior can place youth at risk for not completing the developmental tasks of adolescence and limits their transition into healthy productive adults. NIDA and others have recognized the importance of primary prevention strategies to prevent adolescent drug use. The proposed research investigates the relationship between neighborhood and individual-level risk and protective factors and the co- occurrence of ATOD use and violent behavior. The research findings will inform the development of an intervention to prevent ATOD use and violent behavior. The research project will be embedded in a comprehensive training program design to help me strength and develop new research skills under the direction of a strong mentorship team.",The Role of Place on the Co-occurrence of ATOD Use and Violence Among Youth,9193070,K01DA034765,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Adolescent Behavior ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Homicide ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nurse Practitioners ', ' Play ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Space Perception ', ' spatial perception ', ' spatial orientation ', ' perceptual spatial orientation ', ' Spatial Discrimination ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Review Literature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Security ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' 6th grade ', ' sixth grade ', ' youth drug use ', ' adolescent drug use ', ' youth substance use ', ' substance use among adolescents ', ' adolescent substance use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' teen violence ', ' youth violence ', ' resilience ', ' social disparities ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' stem ', ' spatial relationship ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' ATOD ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' community partnership ', ' prevent ATOD use ', ' ATOD use prevention ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2017,140200,0.06503521896284324
"Evaluation of an Online Intervention to Help Gay Youth Cope with Bullying ﻿     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) youth experience high rates of peer-related bullying. They are much more likely, compared to heterosexual youth, to experience depression, suicidality, illicit drugs, and become HIV infected. Bullying drives, in part, these health disparities. Worse, anti-bullying programs have shown small to moderate effects. GB males will therefore continue to enter toxic school environments. Bullied LGB youth also have less access to coping resources. We hope to improve health and academic outcomes of LGB youth through an online program these youth can easily access. The study's aims are to: 1) develop a culturally competent, state-of-the-art game to reduce bullying among LGB youth. Diverse groups of LGB youth will provide feedback throughout game design. 2) Evaluate the game's feasibility, acceptability, usability and outcomes in a controlled study among 240 adolescent LGB males 14-18 years of age. Feasibility will be assessed by evaluating factors (e.g., log-on rates, use/duration of components, retention rates), and capacity requirements for future trials. Acceptability and usability will be measured quantitatively and qualitatively by asking about emotional dimensions of the user experience; key factors such as readability, comprehensibility, relevancy, helpfulness, credibility and aesthetics; and gaming (i.e. storyline, game-play, characters). Intervention and control groups will be compared on outcomes (i.e., depression, substance use, sexual risk) and hypothesized mediators (self- efficacy, social skills and future orientation). The application is highly innovative as it is, to our knowledge, the first 1) online program targeting young LGB males who are bullied, a format that can reach far greater numbers of LGB youth than face-to-face interventions, 2) bullying prevention program to utilize a gaming format to attract participation and build retention, 3) bullying intervention addressing social and emotional learning among LGB youth and, 4) first online intervention focusing on 14-18 year old LGB males. The game is informed by stress and coping, social and emotional learning, and social cognitive theory and a logic model that relates theory, game mechanics, hypothesized mediators, and outcomes. Three integral game components will affect outcomes. Participants will take on the role of a virtual `coach' to learn how to effectively cope with bullyng; learn social skills -associated with reduced bullying - by partnering with other players; develop a positive orientation towards the future by identifying role models and developing action plans to achieve positive future selves. This intervention will access large numbers of LGB youth, give them skills sets to avoid bullying, and use on-line technologies to ensure program fidelity; resulting in improved health and academic outcomes among LGB youth, while yielding insights to inform the design of interventions for other marginalized populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young gay and bisexual (GB) males are much more likely, compared to heterosexual youth, to experience suicidality, depression, substance abuse, and high-risk sex. They are also much more likely to be bullied at school and studies (reviewed in the application) strongly suggest that bullying victimization is a driver of these health disparitis. However, very little support exists to support these youth. As such, the aims of this application are to develop a state-of-the-art, Internet intervention for 14 - 18 year old GB males and to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, usability and outcomes of the program. This intervention will be the first: 1) online program targeting young GB males who are bullying victims, a format that has the potential to reach far greater numbers of GB youth than traditional face-to-face interventions, 2) bullying prevention program to utilize a gaming format to attract participation and build retention, 3) intervention addressing social and emotional learning with respect to bullying among GB youth and, 4) first online intervention focusing on 14-18 year old GB males - as opposed to the typical focus on GB ""youth"" who are 18 years of age and older. Our focus on younger youth has the potential to affect secondary prevention of the development of downstream psychosocial health problems that result from bullying. Thus, this application could lead to great public health impact by addressing an important problem among GB youth and by giving them real life skills they can use to reduce bullying victimization and longer-term negative health outcomes.",Evaluation of an Online Intervention to Help Gay Youth Cope with Bullying,9247020,R21HD083561,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Environment ', ' Esthetics ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Industry ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Logic ', ' male ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Sexuality ', ' Shame ', ' Smoking ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Technology ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' teacher ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Gays ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' Dimensions ', ' psychosocial ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Controlled Study ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Cognitive ', ' sex ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' control trial ', ' bullying prevention ', ' prevent bullying ', ' Homophobia ', ' Homophobic ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' Same-sex ', ' social learning ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2017,181590,0.023345693084923038
"Mucosal injury from sexual practices: Behaviour and biology of South African adolescents ABSTRACT Globally and in sub-Saharan Africa, adolescent females are at highest risk for HIV. In this region, there are also high levels of gender-based violence and a cultural preference for dry sex. Young women in Southern Africa become sexually active at around 15 years of age similar to those in the US9 and UK10. Adolescence is associated with significant changes in hormone levels, resulting in changes in cervical anatomy that could put them at risk for HIV. Vaginal insertion practices (VIPs) are common in women in sub-Saharan Africa. These VIPs [including intravaginal use of cloth or paper, insertion of products to dry/tighten the vagina and intravaginal cleansing with soap were associated with increased risk for HIV infection5. In four different studies conducted in South Africa, VIP prevalence ranged from 17.9% to 90.1%, depending on the population studied, with the predominant practices being intravaginal washing with soap, cloth or tissue paper for cleansing5. Relationship power inequity and intimate partner violence increase risk of incident HIV infection in young South African women20 This study will evaluate the hypothesis that in adolescent women, sexual immaturity, use of vaginal products and gender-based violence increase genital inflammation, damage the mucosa, alter the vaginal flora, which influences genital HIV target cell availability. To address this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims using two cohorts of HIV-negative SA adolescents in regions differentially at risk for HIV infection and with differing cultural norms for vaginal product use. We propose to enroll 300 adolescent females (aged 14-19 years) and 100 adult women (aged 25-35) and cluster them according to VIP use: (1) nothing (control); (2) using cloth or paper to wipe out the vagina; (3) intravaginal cleansing with soap; (4) intravaginal cleaning with household cleaners; or (5) products to dry/tighten vagina. Information about exposure to gender-based violence will be collected through the questionnaire. At baseline, examination of the cervix; vaginal vaginal flora, and imunity will be assessed. All women will be followed longitudinally for two consecutive sexual exposures. Women will be evaluated at baseline, <48 hours following sex (trauma visit), and at 7 days (wound healing). Comparing each subject to their own baseline, to the control arm, and to adult women, and building on adolescent trial experience at both clinical sites involved are strengths of this study design. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1. To examine anatomical and immunological characteristics of the adolescent state that may contribute to higher inflammation in the reproductive tract, hence HIV risk 2. To compare inflammatory responses to VIPs and sexual violence in adolescent females and older women The study outlined here may uncover why African adolescents are so disproportionately affected by HIV and has the potential to dramatically influence public health messaging about VIPs and sexual violence to adolescents in developing countries. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, adolescent females are the highest risk group for HIV, and vaginal trauma potentially increases this risk. This proposal will evaluate the effects of adolescent genital biology and the effects of vaginal trauma on vaginal immunology and microbiome. The goal of these studies is to inform clinical trials and messaging for adolescent females in developing countries so that they can effectively prevent their risk of HIV infection.",Mucosal injury

"mHealth Intervention via Mentors: Preventing Substance Use, Sexual Risk and Violence among Inner City Youth through Technology-Enhanced Mentoring PROJECT SUMMARY This K01 proposal, “mHealth Intervention via Mentors: Preventing Substance Use, Sexual Risk, and Violence among Inner City Baltimore Youth through Technology-Enhanced Mentoring,” addresses two fields of study relevant to adolescent health that deserve further attention, particularly in how they can intersect to improve public health: youth mentoring and mobile health (mHealth) prevention interventions. Adolescents growing up in low-income urban areas such as Baltimore are at particularly high risk for unhealthy practices such as substance use, sexual risk, and engagement in violence. For adolescents who lack socially protective resources such as parents, attentive teachers, or community networks, mentors can play a significant role in helping to reduce stress, prevent negative health behaviors, and model positive health behaviors. However, little is known about the pathways by which mentee health behavior change occurs, especially for the prevention of substance use, how matched mentors can effectively communicate health promotion messages, or how mHealth technology might be leveraged to enhance existing mentoring models. Utilizing knowledge and training gained through this award in the areas of adolescent substance use, mHealth interventions, and analysis of dyadic and “big” social media and smartphone data, the goal of the proposed study is to develop a prevention intervention in the form of a smartphone application (app), as well as training materials for using the app, to enhance existing mentoring models for highly vulnerable African American male adolescents in urban Baltimore. The training, professional development, and pilot data gained under this award will allow me to propose an R01 to conduct a naturalistic study or randomized controlled trial to measure effect sizes in the reduction of substance use and related health risk behaviors among mentored adolescent males. Support under a K award and the linked career development experiences will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on a new area of expertise—substance use prevention with urban American youth using mHealth—and to learn the skills required for successfully pursing NIH research funding. My long-term career goal is to answer the following research questions: 1) How can mentoring help improve health outcomes for at-risk adolescents and reduce health disparities in adulthood? and 2) How can mHealth be used in prevention intervention with this population? Fully understanding how to set up a systematic research program that intersects the fields of youth mentoring and effective mHealth intervention has great potential to lead me towards an innovative and productive independent research career in a new area. My intermediate career goals under this training grant are to focus work locally with African American adolescent males in Baltimore City, understand how technology-enhanced mentoring can serve as a universal prevention tool for urban male adolescents, build capacity to analyze dyadic data and data produced by social media and smartphone applications, and to develop collaborations with leading investigators in substance use prevention, youth mentoring, and mHealth research.

"Early Adversity Shapes Adolescent Risk Behavior Trajectories in Mexican Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over half a million people in the United States have died of AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic, and the number of people living with HIV infection is higher now than ever before. Currently, over 1 million adults and adolescents in the US are living with HIV. The majority of new HIV cases occur before age 25 and young Latinos are disproportionately affected. Compared to non-Latino white youths, Latino adolescents have 4 times the risk of HIV infection and, by young adulthood, more than 4 times the rate of AIDS diagnosis. Latinos are more likely to use substances in early adolescence and more likely to engage in unprotected sex than other ethnic groups, which increases their risk for HIV/AIDS. These disparities are persistent and represent a critical public health issue given the growing population of young Latinos in the US. Mexican Americans represent the largest subgroup of Latinos, yet longitudinal studies with Mexican American youth have been sparse due to a host of methodological barriers. The proposed longitudinal research resolves these issues to address important scientific gaps. By building on a rich, well-established, long-term cohort of Mexican American children and their parents, this project aims to understand whether and how adversity exposure in early life contributes to the emergence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence. Towards this aim, we will gather detailed information on substance use and sexual risk-taking at ages 14y and 15.5y, when adolescents are sustaining the major social and biological transitions of the pubertal period. The strong study design builds on: (1) rich adversit data already collected during pregnancy and throughout childhood for this established cohort of Mexican American youth and their parents, combined with new equally rich data collection proposed in adolescence; (2) impressive participant retention to date in this hard-to-reach population; (3) ongoing assessing of puberty using leading-edge clinic-based methods obtained at multiple points in time; (4) the inclusion of new measures of stress responsively and pubertal hormones to better understand underlying bio physiological processes; and (5) the inclusion of key protective factors, including parental influences and cultural factors, that may buffer against risk for adolescent problem behaviors. Results from this project will yield important information about the emergence of substance use and sexual risk-taking within this highly vulnerable group. By focusing on potentially modifiable characteristics, this research has the potential to elucidate distinct areas to target for intervention to prevent risk-taking behaviors in adolescence and thereby reduce risk for HIV/AIDS and other STIs over the life course. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is increasing recognition that early life events influence long-term health and health disparities. The design of this study allows us to longitudinally examine the effects of early adversity on the emergence of substance use and risky sexual behaviors among Mexican American adolescents, as well as key factors that may mediate or moderate these effects.

"Iron Deficiency and Adversity in Early Life and Cardiometabolic Risk in Adulthood ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iron deficiency (ID) is associated with cardiovascular events such as stroke in children and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in adulthood. However, it is unknown whether ID in infancy contributes to the development of CVD and metabolic syndrome (cardio-metabolic risk). Studies of developmental effects of early ID demonstrate long-term negative effects on cognitive functioning, behavior, and socio-emotional development. Such changes may affect health behaviors that increase cardio-metabolic risk. Early adversity (e.g., poverty, maltreatment) is linked to higher cardio-metabolic risk and might also operate through similar cognitive, behavioral, and socio-emotional pathways. As ID is more common in low SES and other disadvantaged circumstances, a yet untested hypothesis is that there is a dual burden of having both ID and early adverse experiences that negatively affects functioning and subsequently increases cardio-metabolic risk. The goal of this project is to understand pathways between early ID and adversity and adult cardio-metabolic risk in order to identify targets for prevention and intervention and to detect subgroups at highest risk for disruptions in functioning and cardio-metabolic health. This goal will be accomplished using data from a large longitudinal study (n > 1000) of the effects of ID from infancy to early adulthood (PIs: Betsy Lozoff and Sheila Gahagan). Information on early ID and adversity (SES, life stress, maternal depression, father absence), adolescent cognitive functioning, health behaviors, and mental health, and adult cardio-metabolic risk (BMI, fat mass, blood pressure, blood lipids, hormonal regulators of metabolism) will be utilized. The first aim will test whether there are indirect effects of early ID on adult cardio-metabolic risk through pathways related to adolescent cognitive functioning, health behaviors, and mental health. The second aim will examine whether early adversity affects cardio-metabolic risk through similar or different pathways. The third aim will examine whether the dual burden of ID and adversity further increases cardio-metabolic risk in adulthood through these adolescent pathways. These aims will be accomplished with a training plan emphasizing the neurobiological and behavioral effects of early ID (sponsor Lozoff), childhood influences on cardio-metabolic risk (co-sponsor Gahagan), early adversity (Lozoff and Gahagan), and advanced statistical methods. Completing this research and training will be the first step in the PI's career plan to conduct policy-relevant research on the impact of nutrition and adversity on mental and physical health throughout the lifespan.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although prior research shows associations between early adversity, cardiovascular disease, and obesity, to date no study has examined whether iron deficiency (ID) early in life, which is more common in adverse environments, contributes to cardiovascular and metabolic risk indirectly through effects in adolescence. The current project tests the novel hypothesis that early ID and adversity increase cardiovascular and metabolic risk in adulthood through alterations in adolescent health behaviors, cognitive functioning, and mental health. If early ID contributes to greater cardiovascular and metabolic risk, especially for individuals experiencing early adversity, iron supplementation for infants in adverse environments may reduce disruptions in adolescent functioning and associated risks for cardiovascular disease and obesity.        ",Iron Deficiency and Adversity in Early Life and Cardiometabolic Risk in

"Early Life Determinants of Accelerated Pubertal Development in Adolescent Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Kubo's long-term career goal is to understand early-life determinants of cancer risk factors that relate to obesity and metabolic dysregulation, and to identify high-risk sub-populations that can benefit from early intervention strategies. Her primary research aim is to examine whether factors such as intrauterine exposure to maternal gestational diabetes (GDM), excessive gestational weight gain, obesity, and rapid infant weight gain increase the risk of accelerated pubertal onset in adolescent girls, an important breast and reproductive cancer risk factor. Her secondary aim is to explore the causes of the observed racial/ethnic differences in timing of puberty. No previous studies have examined these associations. These research goals will take advantage of electronic health data that are available in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated health plan that covers about 450,000 girls. Two specific approaches are proposed: 1. Linkage of mothers' and daughters' electronic health data in an on-going prospective study of predictors of sexual maturation in adolescent girls (U01 ES/CA019435) (Study 1); and, 2. Establishment of a new cohort of 20,000 multiethnic mother-daughter pairs using the electronic databases within KPNC (Study 2). Study 1 will utilize data from the CYGNET study (PI: Lawrence H. Kushi, ScD), which has been following 444 girls annually since 2005 with extensive information on pubertal development and anthropometric measures. The KPNC GDM and Pregnancy Glucose Tolerance Registry (Director: Assiamira Ferrara, MD, PhD) will be linked to the CYGNET data to accomplish study 1. In addition, the Registry will be used to establish a new cohort of mother-daughter pairs. This will allow Dr. Kubo gain experience and skills in establishing and follow a cohort based on KPNC electronic medical record data, and to explore racial/ethnic differences in pubertal onset. Electronic documentation of Tanner stage (an established five-stage classification scheme to assess pubertal development) from routine pediatric visits has recently been implemented at KPNC, and this availability on a large and diverse pediatric population makes this study unique and innovative. The candidate's research goals will be complemented with formal, mentored training through coursework and tailored tutorials in pediatric endocrinology, intergenerational transmission of metabolic dysregulation, advanced biostatistics, cancer prevention and health disparities, and responsible conduct of research. KPNC's Division of Research is an ideal environment for the proposed training because it provides unique and extensive electronic databases, access to data from a large, multiethnic membership, and internationally-recognized multidisciplinary experts. The planned scientific training and mentorship will build on the candidate's previous training in nutrition and cancer epidemiology, and uniquely position her to attain her goals. The proposed studies will provide crucial skills in establishing a new cohort, providing a platform for Dr. Kubo to develop successful R01 research to further elucidate early life determinants of pubertal onset and other cancer risk factors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past century, adolescent girls have been maturing significantly earlier in the United States, with substantial racial/ethnic differences. Early-maturing girls are at risk for a variety of negative health outcomes, including increased risk of breast and other reproductive cancers, though aside from obesity, little is known as to what early life factors influence the timing of pubertal development. The proposed research will allow me to better understand early determinants of accelerated pubertal development in girls and to identify high risk populations, which can inform future effective

"Building Mobile Technologies to Reduce Health Disparities in Congenital Heart Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growing congenital heart disease adolescent survivor population faces two major health disparities in care: (1) poor care transition (an age and developmentally appropriate process, addressing the medical, psychosocial and educational/vocational aspects of care) from child-centered to adult-centered healthcare; and (2) lack of appropriate transfer of care (the point at which an adult cardiac provider assumes the medical care of a CHD patient). The transition period is a vulnerable time for adolescents with CHD, and many drop-out from active health care. Dropping out leads to poor health outcomes, and does not allow for appropriate transfer to adult care. The newly validated SMART (Socio-ecological Model of Adolescent & young adult Readiness for Transition) model has the potential to improve this process, by targeting modifiable variables for intervention in the transition and transfer process through assessments of five parameters: adolescent socio-demographics, disease characteristics and knowledge, skills/self-efficacy, relationships and psychosocial functioning. Using SMART, our research will engage CHD adolescents and promote transition and transfer using a modality that universally defines their generation: mobile technology. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify transition needs for CHD adolescents, facilitate transfer of care, and adapt SMART for these needs by developing and piloting an interactive e-health (mobile based) platform that will promote the key knowledge and skills that adolescents need to successfully transition and transfer to adult care. The mobile-based platform will target modifiable variables to improve transition and transfer of care for CHD adolescents. To achieve these goals, the Specific Aims include:  Aim 1: Complete a stakeholder needs assessment of CHD adolescents, parents, pediatric cardiology and adult congenital providers. We will assess baseline competencies in self-management, key skills, health literacy (HL), and transition readiness (TR) of CHD adolescents. Hypothesis: Low adolescent HL scores will correlate with low TR and low parental HL. Needs assessment will inform the educational content and design of our e-health platform.  Aim 2: Design and develop the educational content for a mobile e-health platform informed by:  modifiable variables in the SMART model, the existing literature on CHD knowledge gaps in adolescents,  the needs assessment, adaptation of an existing mentorship program, and varying levels of HL and TR. A formative iterative process with adolescents of various HL and TR levels will be used to further develop the content and design of this mobile-based e-health application to enhance adolescent transition.  Aim 3: Conduct a pilot study of the mobile-based platform to assess feasibility, adolescent recruitment and engagement, and facilitate the transition and transfer process. Improving transition and transfer are critical to successful long-term disease management and survival. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    The proposed research is relevant to public health because it addresses the needs of Americans who are surviving and living with congenital heart disease (CHD). This research plan is unique, timely, and of high public health significance as it applies mobile technologies to streamline transition and transfer of care for adolescents with CHD or other chronic diseases. Furthermore, it provides a strategy to reduce disparities in minority CHD populations and low health literacy families.",Building Mobile Technologies to Reduce Health Disparities in Congenital Heart Disease,9336348,K23HL127164,"['Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Belief ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dropout ', ' Elements ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Survivors ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Health Transition ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' psychosocial ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' American ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' health application ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' efficacy testing ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Pediatric cardiology ', ' adolescent health ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' palliate ', ' ']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K23,2017,158565,0.11767519502130874
"Community Violence and Reproductive Health among Youth in Salinas, California DESCRIPTION: The objective of this study, led by an early-stage investigator building directly on her NICHD K01 research, is to address gaps in research on structural and interpersonal factors in a rural, agricultural community that influence the onset of youth violence and sexual health risks associated with teen pregnancy during the transition from early to middle adolescence. In California, where one in eight U.S. adolescents reside; Latinas maintain the highest teen birth rate, accounting, in 2010, for 41% of the teen population yet 73% of teen births. Adolescent sexual health research has focused primarily on urban youth; however, one in three California teen births are to Latina teens residing in a rural county. Numerous structural and interpersonal (family, peer, partner) factors that shape the risk environment differ between urban and rural communities. Understanding these underlying contexts that contribute to health disparities is vital to achieving substantive improvements in health outcomes. Our NIH-funded research with Latino adolescents in San Francisco over the past 12 years has highlighted a strong connection between community violence and unintended teen pregnancy. Though traditionally regarded as urban, gangs have emerged in many nonurban areas of the United States. This study will take place in Salinas, CA, an agricultural community located in Monterey County on California's central coast. The U.S. Department of Justice named Salinas as one of six high-risk communities nationally for youth gang violence. Monterey County had the sixth highest teen birth rate in 2010 among California's 58 counties. High rates of youth violence and early childbearing in Salinas, California, coupled with entrenched socioeconomic disparities resulting from generations of Mexican migration for agricultural-sector employment, make research to develop appropriate interventions imperative. This context presents an opportunity to examine the relative salience of structural and interpersonal factors to youth violence and reproductive health in a rural county like numerous others throughout central California. This research was initiated by the Monterey County Health Department and has been developed in partnership with an experienced team of NIH investigators. Informed by the Social Ecological Model of Health, we will accomplish our aims through a mixed-methods design that includes formative qualitative research using focus groups, followed by a 2-year prospective cohort study with a random sample of 600 8th grade students, 40 of whom will be selected to complete prospective in-depth interviews. Our aims are to 1) investigate structural and interpersonal factors that are individually and jointly associated with engagement in violent behaviors and sexual health risks among female and male 8th-grade Latino students in Salinas, CA; 2) examine the trajectories of violent behaviors and sexual risk over time, and their interaction, during the transition from 8th grade to 10th grade; and 3) identify structural and interpersonal factors that influence engagement in violent behaviors and sexual health risks during the transition from 8th grade to 10th grade.

"Social Ecology and the Prevention of Suicide and Aggression in African American Y DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This indicated prevention intervention trial employs a randomized controlled design to examine the efficacy of a 15-session, culturally tailored, cognitive-behavioral group prevention intervention for urban, low income African American adolescents. The PI successfully adapted the Coping with Stress Course (Clarke et al., 1995) to be culturally sensitive and appropriate for use with urban, low-income African American adolescents. This culturally-adapted intervention (i.e., the Adapted-Coping with Stress Course [Robinson & Case, 2003]) will be significantly revised to enhance individual competencies believed to mitigate the risk for self-directed (i.e., suicidality) and inter-personal aggression. n addition, the proposed study aims to examine how neighborhood and family ecological characteristics moderate the effects of a culturally-adapted, cognitive-behavioral coping with stress prevention intervention on African American adolescents' self-directed (i.e., suicidality) and interpersonal aggression.  This study is expected to have broad public health implications toward the reduction of African American youth health disparities and inform practice and policy on the development of effective violence prevention interventions for African American youth. It is expected that this study will inform a future large scale effectiveness study that will embed an evidence-based, culturally sensitive violence prevention intervention within a large urban school system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is transformative and will provide vital knowledge pertaining to the understanding and prevention of African American youth violence, both self-directed and interpersonal. In addition to examining the efficacy of a culturally sensive prevention intervention, the proposed study aims to examine how neighborhood and family ecological characteristics moderate the effects of the culturally-adapted, cognitive-behavioral coping with stress prevention intervention.

"Identifying Environmental Factors Promoting HIV/STI Risk in Black Adolescents and Young Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect Black adolescents and young adults in the United States. Environmental or structural factors such as discrimination, crime, and poverty have been proposed as potential drivers of persistent racial disparities. Though HIV and STI incidence tend to be geospatially clustered, the specific environmental predictors of clustering among Black adolescents and young adults are not well understood. Exploratory mapping using geographic information systems (GIS) has revealed that HIV and STI incidence in adolescents and young adults is higher in certain neighborhoods in Massachusetts, the setting of the proposed project. Determining the associations between specific environmental factors in neighborhoods and HIV/STI incidence in Black adolescents and young adults is important for intervention planning. Candidate: My career goal is to become an independent investigator focused on developing structural interventions for HIV/STI prevention in underserved communities. As a physician trained in Infectious Diseases, I am fully committed to overcoming persistent health disparities noted among people at risk for and living with HIV and STIs. To become an independent investigator, I require additional research training and mentorship, building on the clinical, publc health, and implementation science training that I have previously received. Research Proposal: The primary objective of this proposal is to determine the relationships between neighborhood-level environmental factors and HIV/STI incidence in Black adolescents and young adults. The proposed study has three AIMs: (1) to qualitatively explore the impact that environmental factors have on HIV and STI risk behavior by conducting focus groups with Black adolescents and young adults from higher and lower HIV/STI incidence neighborhoods; (2) to quantitatively determine the association between selected environmental factors and HIV/STI incidence using geospatial analysis; and (3) to use a mixed- methods participatory approach to identify interventions to address environmental factors associated with HIV/STIs using data gathered in AIMs 1 and 2. Training: The research plan will be supported by courses in qualitative, quantitative, and geospatial analyses, clinical trial design and utilization of large scale socio-behavioral and demographic data sets for secondary analyses. Mentorship and Resources: My mentorship team will be co-led by Dr. Kenneth Mayer, Infectious Disease Specialist and expert in HIV/STI prevention and Dr. Laura Bogart, social psychologist with expertise in disparities in HIV, adolescent health, and qualitative and quantitative methods. To achieve my goals, I will avail myself of the resources available within the Division of Global Health Equity at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Fenway Institute of Fenway Health (www.thefenwayinstitute.org), and the Harvard Center for AIDS Research. I will also benefit from a team of dedicated advisors in geospatial analysis, behavioral health and adolescent sexual health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect Black adolescents and young adults. Environmental or structural factors - practices, policies, institutional and contextual forces that are external to and outsideof an individual's control - may promote or protect against HIV/STI acquisition and contribute to persistent racial disparities. Discrimination, crime, poverty and community beliefs about homosexuality are environmental factors that may be associated with HIV and STI risk in Black adolescents and young adults. Both HIV/STI incidence and these environmental factors tend to be clustered geographically. However, the specific environmental predictors of HIV/STI clustering among Black adolescents and young adults are not well understood. This research seeks to understand the relationships between neighborhood-level environmental factors and HIV/STI incidence in Black adolescents and young adults.

"Engendering Healthy Masculinities to Prevent Sexual Violence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Global health organizations highlight engaging men and boys in preventing violence against women as a potentially impactful public health strategy. A ""gender transformative"" approach involves altering gender and sexuality norms that foster violence against women while promoting bystander intervention (i.e., giving boys skills to interrupt abusive behaviors they witness among peers) to reduce the perpetration of sexual violence (SV) and adolescent relationship abuse (ARA). This study will test, via a two arm cluster randomized controlled trial, a ""gender transformative"" SV/ARA perpetration prevention program titled ""Boys Care"" implemented in a community-based setting among African American adolescent males ages 14-17. This is a stakeholder- engaged intervention that involves an 18 hour curriculum divided into 3 weekend day sessions delivered over a 2 month period (at 4 week intervals) in community-based youth-serving agencies (YMCA and Urban League). Control sites will implement an evidence-based life skills curriculum. The rationale for focusing on primarily African American youth in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods is two-fold. First, racial/ethnic disparities in health are stark in Pittsburgh, the setting for this study; prevention efforts in communities with high prevalence of poverty, sexual violence, and poor health outcomes are needed. Second, the prevention educators are from these communities and have high degrees of trust and respect fundamental to building positive youth relationships. Innovations are: first, an intersectional approach combining gender theory, adolescent sexual development, and community-partnered research to evaluate the impact of gender transformative programming on SV/ARA perpetration in socially disadvantaged communities; second, a program that integrates education and skills building around gender norms change with sexuality education theorized to target SV perpetration and increase healthy sexual behaviors; third, a stakeholder-engaged approach in design and implementation to ensure local relevance, feasibility, and replicability; and fourth, use of arts-based strategies to encourage youth to explore masculinities. Via a 2-arm cluster-randomized trial in youth-serving agencies (10 clusters, N=960 adolescent males ages 14-17), this study will assess the effectiveness of ""Boys Care"" compared to a life skills curriculum. At the end of the 2 month program (Time 2), compared to controls, youth will demonstrate increased positive bystander intervention behaviors (secondary outcome). Intermediate outcomes are: increased condom and contraceptive self-efficacy; increased recognition of abusive behaviors; increased gender-equitable attitudes; and increased intentions to intervene with peers. Six months after the intervention (Time 3), youth will report less perpetration of SV and ARA toward females (Primary Outcome) compared to controls. This study will provide urgently needed information about the effectiveness of a gender transformative program that combines healthy sexuality skills, gender norms change, and bystander skills to interrupt peers' disrespectful and harmful behaviors to reduce SV/ARA perpetration among adolescent males. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Global health organizations highlight engaging men and boys in preventing violence against women as a potentially impactful public health strategy. A ""gender transformative"" approach involves theory- and evidence- based practices to alter gender and sexuality norms that foster violence against women while promoting bystander intervention (i.e., giving boys skills to interrupt abusive behaviors they witness among peers) to reduce the perpetration of sexual violence (SV) and adolescent relationship abuse (ARA).

Silverman and Miller's ARCHES (Addressing Reproductive Coercion in Healthcare Settings) intervention, specific aims are to conduct secondary data analysis of the sub-sample of adolescents (16-20 years old) from ARCHES and 1) Conduct epidemiologic research to estimate the prevalence and correlates of RC among US female adolescents ages 16-20 (n=1311) from the ARCHES intervention; 2) Conduct multilevel longitudinal data analyses of the ARCHES adolescent sample to evaluate the effect of the intervention on RC among this group; 3) Conduct qualitative research to identify barriers to and adapt the ARCHES intervention to improve the reproductive autonomy of female adolescents in urban health clinics in Tijuana (Mexico); 4) Implement the adapted ARCHES intervention for female adolescents in urban health clinics in Tijuana, pilot test its feasibility and estimate effect sizes needed for future lrge-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT). While the specified initial goal of this work is a clinic-based intervention model adapted for adolescent health care in Mexico, the candidates' longer-term goal is to expand implementation of such programs throughout Latin America and in other low and middle-income countries. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reproductive Coercion (RC) has been associated with numerous negative effects on the physical, sexual, and mental health of young women and girls, with RC prevalence the highest among adolescents; 20% of adolescent family planning (FP) clients reporting such abuse. Findings from the proposed research will be critical to the adaptation, implementation, and evaluation of theoretically driven, empirically informed behavioral interventions that address RC among adolescents in a Latin-American country (Mexico) that can be further applied to other settings. In addition, the proposed project will allo the candidate to master a complex set of research skills in development and evaluation of theoretically driven clinic-based interventions, and develop topical expertise required to fully characterize and reduce the impact of RC, and potentially unintended pregnancies among underserved female adolescents in Mexico and other low and middle-income countries.",Preventing IPV and Reproductive Coercion Among Underserved Adolescents,9247788,K23HD084756,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Affect ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan

"Identifying Environmental Factors Promoting HIV/STI Risk in Black Adolescents and Young Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect Black adolescents and young adults in the United States. Environmental or structural factors such as discrimination, crime, and poverty have been proposed as potential drivers of persistent racial disparities. Though HIV and STI incidence tend to be geospatially clustered, the specific environmental predictors of clustering among Black adolescents and young adults are not well understood. Exploratory mapping using geographic information systems (GIS) has revealed that HIV and STI incidence in adolescents and young adults is higher in certain neighborhoods in Massachusetts, the setting of the proposed project. Determining the associations between specific environmental factors in neighborhoods and HIV/STI incidence in Black adolescents and young adults is important for intervention planning. Candidate: My career goal is to become an independent investigator focused on developing structural interventions for HIV/STI prevention in underserved communities. As a physician trained in Infectious Diseases, I am fully committed to overcoming persistent health disparities noted among people at risk for and living with HIV and STIs. To become an independent investigator, I require additional research training and mentorship, building on the clinical, publc health, and implementation science training that I have previously received. Research Proposal: The primary objective of this proposal is to determine the relationships between neighborhood-level environmental factors and HIV/STI incidence in Black adolescents and young adults. The proposed study has three AIMs: (1) to qualitatively explore the impact that environmental factors have on HIV and STI risk behavior by conducting focus groups with Black adolescents and young adults from higher and lower HIV/STI incidence neighborhoods; (2) to quantitatively determine the association between selected environmental factors and HIV/STI incidence using geospatial analysis; and (3) to use a mixed- methods participatory approach to identify interventions to address environmental factors associated with HIV/STIs using data gathered in AIMs 1 and 2. Training: The research plan will be supported by courses in qualitative, quantitative, and geospatial analyses, clinical trial design and utilization of large scale socio-behavioral and demographic data sets for secondary analyses. Mentorship and Resources: My mentorship team will be co-led by Dr. Kenneth Mayer, Infectious Disease Specialist and expert in HIV/STI prevention and Dr. Laura Bogart, social psychologist with expertise in disparities in HIV, adolescent health, and qualitative and quantitative methods. To achieve my goals, I will avail myself of the resources available within the Division of Global Health Equity at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Fenway Institute of Fenway Health (www.thefenwayinstitute.org), and the Harvard Center for AIDS Research. I will also benefit from a team of dedicated advisors in geospatial analysis, behavioral health and adolescent sexual health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect Black adolescents and young adults. Environmental or structural factors - practices, policies, institutional and contextual forces that are external to and outsideof an individual's control - may promote or protect against HIV/STI acquisition and contribute to persistent racial disparities. Discrimination, crime, poverty and community beliefs about homosexuality are environmental factors that may be associated with HIV and STI risk in Black adolescents and young adults. Both HIV/STI incidence and these environmental factors tend to be clustered geographically. However, the specific environmental predictors of HIV/STI clustering among Black adolescents and young adults are not well understood. This research seeks to understand the relationships between neighborhood-level environmental factors and HIV/STI incidence in Black adolescents and young adults. Determining the associations between specific environmental factors and HIV/STI risk and incidence is important for focused intervention planning in this vulnerable population.",Identifying Environmental Factors Promoting HIV/STI Risk in Black Adolescents and Young Adults,9458241,K23MH107316,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Anger ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Belief ', ' Boston ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Crime ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Sources ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Homosexuality ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Massachusetts ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Review Literature ', ' Exposure to ', ' Victimization ', ' American ', ' skills ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' psychological distress ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' implementation science ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' adolescent health ', ' juvenile sexual health ', ' adolescent sexual health ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' sexually transmitted infection prevention ', ' sexually transmitted disease prevention ', ' prevent sexually transmitted infections ', ' prevent sexually transmitted disease ', ' STD prevention ', ' STI prevention ', ' ']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2018,181683,0.0910183484452519
"Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to Reach Vulnerable Young Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Vulnerable female adolescents in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town who use alcohol and other drugs (AOD) and have dropped out of school experience the greatest burden of new HIV infections in South Africa. The risk for acquiring HIV is perpetuated through intersecting factors of AOD use, gender inequality, sexual risk, victimization, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence. Despite the pervasive ongoing transmission of HIV, this vulnerable population remains underserved by current HIV and drug treatment programs, with few providing HIV testing and counselling (HTC), antenatal care, or substance abuse rehabilitation, and none providing comprehensive HTC programs that address these intersecting risks for HIV among this population. Since 2001, we have adapted and conducted a comprehensive evidence-based intervention for women, the Women's Health CoOp (WHC), that addresses AOD use, sexual risk, and gender-based violence. The WHC was listed in the USAID Compendium of Gender Studies in Africa. The Young Women's CoOp (YWC) is an adaptation of the WHC that targets this vulnerable population of AOD using female adolescents. This proposed RFA project seeks to reach this hard-to-reach population and overcome barriers to improved health for female adolescents who have dropped out of school by increasing update of HTC through a comprehensive gender-focused HTC intervention with trained peer co-facilitators and outreach workers from each community. The study findings may provide knowledge that could be used to increase the uptake of services and improve treatment adherence among female adolescents through the use of peer-driven intervention methods. Specific Aims: Our specific aims including the following. In a cluster randomized trial conducted in 12 disadvantaged communities in Cape Town, South Africa, and with government collaboration, we propose: Aim 1. To train and evaluate adolescent peer role models to conduct community outreach with established outreach workers to recruit 500 out-of schools, substance-using female adolescents aged 15-19 for HTC, and to co-facilitate a gender-focused comprehensive HTC program. Aim 2. To test the efficacy of a young women's gender-focused comprehensive HTC program for reducing substance use, victimization, and sexual risk behavior (primary outcomes) and improving access to effective treatment and support services through linkages to care (substance abuse treatment, HIV, STIs, antenatal and reproductive health as secondary outcomes) relative to standard HTC for adolescent females. This study's collaboration with the Western Cape-Department of Social Development and the City of Cape Town will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention within community centers will most likely ensure greater sustainability where it is needed most. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact for the proposed study is tri-fold and described as follows. First, reaching 500 adolescent females in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town with its high rates of school dropout (and often consequent unemployment), substance use, gender inequality, sexual risk, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence is essential for HTC and risk reduction, as these intersecting risk factors appear to be antecedents to the overwhelming gender differences in HIV prevalence among young women relative to men in this region. Second, this study's collaboration with the WC-DoSD will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention and is likely to ensure sustainabiliy of the intervention within communities. Third, determining the efficacy of the comprehensive gender intervention for greater application will be essential for the most at-risk female adolescents.",Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to

"Adolescent Marijuana Use and Marijuana Possession Arrests: Have Changes in Marijuana Policy Affected Disparities Between Blacks and Whites? Project Summary We address important knowledge gaps involving how changes in marijuana policy affect adolescents, especially the effectiveness of these policies at attending to longstanding racial disparities. We will investigate how changes in marijuana policy affect marijuana possession arrests, which can have life- long negative consequences. We will also identify states where policy change could be related to disparities in marijuana use. To our knowledge, neither of these topics has been covered in the academic literature. Our primary goal is to assess how the timing of the implementation of medical marijuana laws, marijuana decriminalization, and marijuana legalization are related to changes in: (1) race-based differences in adolescent marijuana use within states over time, (2) adolescent marijuana possession arrest rates, and (3) the disparity between Black and White adolescent marijuana possession arrests. For comparison, we will also assess how these policies have affected adult arrests and rates of use, since they typically target adult use specifically. While the focus of the study is on longstanding racial disparities, we will also explore differences by sex. We will compare states that have implemented one of these marijuana policies to a “synthetic control” state constructed from outcomes and covariates from states without a policy. This data-driven modeling procedure creates a synthetic counterfactual that is not limited by confounding introduced by changes over time that might occur in unexposed control states. This will allow us to focus on specific policy environments, which vary widely by state. In Aim 1 we examine whether state-level medical marijuana, marijuana legalization and marijuana decriminalization policies have led to an overall decline in adolescent arrests for marijuana possession. We hypothesize that changes in marijuana policy have been associated with an overall decline in adolescent marijuana possession arrests. In Aim 2 we determine whether there are differences in adolescent marijuana possession arrests based on race and sex. We hypothesize that White male and female adolescents have benefitted disproportionately from any decrease in marijuana possession arrests related to a change in marijuana policy. In Aim 3 we investigate whether differences in adolescent marijuana use at the state level account for any arrest disparities. We hypothesize that any disparities in marijuana possession arrests can be explained by between-groups differences in marijuana use. We will also explore apparent differences in marijuana use disparities within states over time and note obvious relationships between marijuana policy implementation and adolescent marijuana use disparities. Project Narrative The need to reduce racial disparities in marijuana arrests is often used to justify marijuana decriminalization and legalization. However, it is unknown how these policies affect longstanding disparities in marijuana arrests or use, especially for adolescents, for whom early arrest can have life-long negative consequences. This project will assess how changes in medical marijuana laws, marijuana decriminalization and marijuana legalization have affected disparities in adolescent marijuana arrests and marijuana use.",Adolescent Marijuana Use and Marijuana Possession Arrests: Have Changes in Marijuana Policy Affected Disparities Between Blacks and Whites?,9586749,R03DA046757,"['Academy ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Peer Review ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' academic review ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' American ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' sex ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' social health determinants ', ' medicinal cannabis ', ' medical cannabis ', ' Medicinal Marijuana ', ' Medical Marijuana ', ' marijuana use in adolescence ', ' marijuana use among adolescents ', ' cannabis use among adolescents ', ' Adolescent marijuana use ', ' decriminalize marijuana ', ' decriminalize cannabis ', ' cannabis decriminalization ', ' marijuana decriminalization ', ' legalized marijuana ', ' legalized cannabis ', ' legal marijuana ', ' cannabis legalization ', ' marijuana legalization ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' cannabis use ', ' THC use ', ' THC co-use ', ' marijuana use ', ' ']",NIDA,EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL,R03,2018,82548,0.17121912084982077
"Hormones, Immunity and HIV Risk ABSTRACT Our over arching goal of this application is to determine if exogenous progestins used in long acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) will enhance adolescent risk for mucosal HIV acquisition. In the U.S., persons aged 13-24 years accounted for 26% of all new HIV infections. The HIV epidemic in adolescent girls reflects the strong combined impact of gender and income inequality, early sexual debut, age disparate sexual relationships, psychosexual maturation, sociocultural context, and heightened biological vulnerability. Exogenous progestins, expecially medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), have been epidemiologically linked to greater HIV acquisition. Gaps remain in our understanding of biological factors that might be associated with increased risk of HIV acqusition in adolescent girls and how exogenous progestins will influence this risk. LARCs use is encouraged for all women desiring to not become pregnant as they release progestins over 3 to 5 years. Typical LARCs include etonogestrel implants (ENG-I) or levonorgestrel-intrauterine system (LNG- IUS). Our preliminary data shows cervical tissue collected from women using MPA and LNG-IUS for contraception replicates HIV 2- to 3.5-fold higher than cervical tissue from non-contracepting women. Therefore, our aims center on potential genital tract differences non-contracepting and contracepting (ENG-I and LNG-IUS) 120 adolescents (18 to 19 years old) and correlate our findings to non-contracepting and contracepting 90 adult women (≥25 years old). First, differences in the capcity of cerivcal tissue to replicate HIV will be assess between the groups and associated with resident cell populations. Secondly, the vaginal fluid and epithelium, which provide the first line of defense against pathogens, including HIV, will be systematically studied. Vaginal fluid will be characterized for the microflora and the soluble mucosal proteins using an unbiased proteomic approach. These results will be correlated to functional activity of the luminal fluid as measured by in vitro anti-HIV activity. Our premise is that non-contracepting adolescent women will demonstrate higher levels of mediators and activated immune cells that are associated with increased HIV infection compared to more mature women. However, contracepting adolescent and adult women will have comparable levels of the mediators, activated immune cells, and capacity of tissue to replicate HIV. A key challenge will be the recruitment of adolescent girls. Our advantage is that adolescents frequent the outpatient clinic at Magee Womens Hospital and our clinical team has worked with adolescents in other studies, which overcomes many of the recruitment challenges. We have close working relationships among the groups represented in this application and have optimized specimen handling/processing/testing which is key for reproducibility in our work. This application will uniquely associate quantified analyses with functional outcomes and begin to address if exogenous progestins impose additional risk of HIV acquisition to young women. NARRATIVE Young women make up 20% of incident HIV infections in the U.S. and long acting reversible contraception is provided to reduce pregnancies. We lack information on biological factors in young girls that make them susceptible to HIV infection and if the contraception provided increases their risk in acquiring HIV. This application will help fill this gap by determining if the contraceptive hormones negatively modify those biological factors with the goal of improving the health of next generation.","Hormones,

"Predicting Suicide Risk in Sexual Minority and Nonminority Youth: Associations Among Neural Sensitivity to Social Rejection, Peer Rejection, and Suicidality ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a need for research that can help better predict risk and prevent suicide among adolescent youth. Rates of suicidality, a strong predictor of suicide, are higher among adolescent girls compared to boys, and highest among sexual minority girls (girls who endorse same-sex romantic attraction, behavior or identity). This study tests an innovative model of suicide risk in a sample of sexual minority and nonminority adolescent girls that integrates neurobehavioral and interpersonal vulnerabilities. Specifically, the model posits that neural sensitivity to social rejection, when occurring in the presence of peer rejection, increases risk for suicide. This proposed K01 bridges the candidate's prior training in interpersonal risk for depression and developmental psychopathology, with new training in affective neuroscience and suicide risk. This training will uniquely position the candidate to investigate the development of negative valence systems, with an emphasis on affective sensitivity to social rejection, and associations with suicidality. Thus, the proposed study will be the first in a larger program of research that will contribute to NIMH research priorities, such as Strategic Objective 2, by investigating how individual differences in biologic and social/environmental factors contribute to heterogeneity in the development of suicide risk in diverse populations. Specifically, the candidate plans to follow the proposed study with larger longitudinal studies using multiple methods and repeated assessments of neurobehavioral and interpersonal vulnerability for suicide during the adolescent developmental period to examine 1) how pain related neural circuitry underlying affective sensitivity to social rejection may be associated with suicide risk, and 2) interpersonal factors (e.g., interpersonal rejection) that may contribute to and strengthen sensitivity to social rejection over time within the context of social and pubertal changes in adolescence. The candidate will also be positioned to investigate etiological models explaining elevated suicide risk among sexual minority youth. This program of research is expected to advance the field by improving the ability to predict risk for suicide among vulnerable youth, and to identify targets for intervention during optimal developmental windows.  To achieve these career objectives, the candidate will receive training in developmental affective neuroscience, neuroimaging methods, and theory and research on development of suicide risk in adolescence, including sexual minority youth. She has an ideal mentorship team within an optimal scientific training environment to provide the requisite training for her to meet her career goals. Dr. Jennifer Silk is an expert on development of social-emotional processing from childhood into adolescence. Dr. Mary Phillips has significant expertise in affective neuroscience and fMRI methods, and neural underpinnings of emotional reactivity and regulation. Dr. Michael Marshal provides expertise on suicidality disparities between sexual minority and nonminority youth. Additional mentorship and support from consultants will provide training in the role of pain neural circuitry underlying the affective experience of social rejection (i.e. ""social pain"", Dr. Naomi Eisenberger), and the development of suicide risk in adolescents (Dr. David Brent) and new methods to assess suicide risk (Dr. Matt Nock). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents in the U.S., and suicide rates increase markedly during the transition from childhood to adolescence. The study will be the first in a larger program of research designed to investigate how the RDoC domain for negative valence systems is linked to suicide by investigating how aspects of the physical pain system involved in affective responses to social rejection and loss may influence risk for suicide, and how exposure to rejection experiences may amplify risk for suicide among vulnerable youth. Knowledge gained from this research will inform 1) what interventions should be used for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, such as the potential use of neuromodulatory interventions currently used to treat physical pain conditions, 2) who is in need of these interventions, such as youth with heightened affective sensitivity to social rejection, and 3) when to use these interventions, such as after social rejection experiences during the adolescent developmental period.","Predicting Suicide Risk in Sexual Minority and Nonminority Youth: Associations Among Neural Sensitivity to Social Rejection, Peer Rejection, and Suicidality",9504515,K01MH109850,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Interview ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Social Development ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Somatosensory Cortex ', ' somesthetic sensory cortex ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Silk ', ' Friends ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' career ', ' Friendships ', ' improved ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' Marshal ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' social separation ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' emotional distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Brain region ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' High Prevalence ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' peer victimization ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' suicide model ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' neural model ', ' Affective ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' sexual minority ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' Negative Valence ', ' Same-sex ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2018,159743,0.00619708328218947
"Early Adversity Shapes Adolescent Risk Behavior Trajectories in Mexican Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over half a million people in the United States have died of AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic, and the number of people living with HIV infection is higher now than ever before. Currently, over 1 million adults and adolescents in the US are living with HIV. The majority of new HIV cases occur before age 25 and young Latinos are disproportionately affected. Compared to non-Latino white youths, Latino adolescents have 4 times the risk of HIV infection and, by young adulthood, more than 4 times the rate of AIDS diagnosis. Latinos are more likely to use substances in early adolescence and more likely to engage in unprotected sex than other ethnic groups, which increases their risk for HIV/AIDS. These disparities are persistent and represent a critical public health issue given the growing population of young Latinos in the US. Mexican Americans represent the largest subgroup of Latinos, yet longitudinal studies with Mexican American youth have been sparse due to a host of methodological barriers. The proposed longitudinal research resolves these issues to address important scientific gaps. By building on a rich, well-established, long-term cohort of Mexican American children and their parents, this project aims to understand whether and how adversity exposure in early life contributes to the emergence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence. Towards this aim, we will gather detailed information on substance use and sexual risk-taking at ages 14y and 15.5y, when adolescents are sustaining the major social and biological transitions of the pubertal period. The strong study design builds on: (1) rich adversit data already collected during pregnancy and throughout childhood for this established cohort of Mexican American youth and their parents, combined with new equally rich data collection proposed in adolescence; (2) impressive participant retention to date in this hard-to-reach population; (3) ongoing assessing of puberty using leading-edge clinic-based methods obtained at multiple points in time; (4) the inclusion of new measures of stress responsively and pubertal hormones to better understand underlying bio physiological processes; and (5) the inclusion of key protective factors, including parental influences and cultural factors, that may buffer against risk for adolescent problem behaviors. Results from this project will yield important information about the emergence of substance use and sexual risk-taking within this highly vulnerable group. By focusing on potentially modifiable characteristics, this research has the potential to elucidate distinct areas to target for intervention to prevent risk-taking behaviors in adolescence and thereby reduce risk for HIV/AIDS and other STIs over the life course. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is increasing recognition that early life events influence long-term health and health disparities. The design of this study allows us to longitudinally examine the effects of early adversity on the emergence of substance use and risky sexual behaviors among Mexican American adolescents, as well as key factors that may mediate or moderate these effects. This research aims to elucidate targets for intervention to prevent risk- taking behaviors in adolescence and thereby reduce risk for HIV/AIDS and other STIs over the life course.",Early Adversity

"Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to Reach Vulnerable Young Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Vulnerable female adolescents in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town who use alcohol and other drugs (AOD) and have dropped out of school experience the greatest burden of new HIV infections in South Africa. The risk for acquiring HIV is perpetuated through intersecting factors of AOD use, gender inequality, sexual risk, victimization, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence. Despite the pervasive ongoing transmission of HIV, this vulnerable population remains underserved by current HIV and drug treatment programs, with few providing HIV testing and counselling (HTC), antenatal care, or substance abuse rehabilitation, and none providing comprehensive HTC programs that address these intersecting risks for HIV among this population. Since 2001, we have adapted and conducted a comprehensive evidence-based intervention for women, the Women's Health CoOp (WHC), that addresses AOD use, sexual risk, and gender-based violence. The WHC was listed in the USAID Compendium of Gender Studies in Africa. The Young Women's CoOp (YWC) is an adaptation of the WHC that targets this vulnerable population of AOD using female adolescents. This proposed RFA project seeks to reach this hard-to-reach population and overcome barriers to improved health for female adolescents who have dropped out of school by increasing update of HTC through a comprehensive gender-focused HTC intervention with trained peer co-facilitators and outreach workers from each community. The study findings may provide knowledge that could be used to increase the uptake of services and improve treatment adherence among female adolescents through the use of peer-driven intervention methods. Specific Aims: Our specific aims including the following. In a cluster randomized trial conducted in 12 disadvantaged communities in Cape Town, South Africa, and with government collaboration, we propose: Aim 1. To train and evaluate adolescent peer role models to conduct community outreach with established outreach workers to recruit 500 out-of schools, substance-using female adolescents aged 15-19 for HTC, and to co-facilitate a gender-focused comprehensive HTC program. Aim 2. To test the efficacy of a young women's gender-focused comprehensive HTC program for reducing substance use, victimization, and sexual risk behavior (primary outcomes) and improving access to effective treatment and support services through linkages to care (substance abuse treatment, HIV, STIs, antenatal and reproductive health as secondary outcomes) relative to standard HTC for adolescent females. This study's collaboration with the Western Cape-Department of Social Development and the City of Cape Town will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention within community centers will most likely ensure greater sustainability where it is needed most. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact for the proposed study is tri-fold and described as follows. First, reaching 500 adolescent females in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town with its high rates of school dropout (and often consequent unemployment), substance use, gender inequality, sexual risk, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence is essential for HTC and risk reduction, as these intersecting risk factors appear to be antecedents to the overwhelming gender differences in HIV prevalence among young women relative to men in this region. Second, this study's collaboration with the WC-DoSD will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention and is likely to ensure sustainabiliy of the intervention within communities. Third, determining the efficacy of the comprehensive gender intervention for greater application will be essential for the most at-risk female adolescents.",Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to

"The Impact of Stress and Resilience on Obesity-Related Metabolic Complications in Adolescents PROJECT SUMMARY Rates of obesity are high in adolescents, with these youth at greater risk for developing metabolic complications than their lean peers. Poor metabolic function is associated with worse health outcomes, higher health care costs, and other health comorbidities; however, not all youth with obesity develop metabolic complications. Black youth have fewer metabolic complications compared to White youth, despite having among the highest rates of obesity. Understanding unique protective factors that slow the progression to poor metabolic health is necessary for reducing adverse health outcomes and improving the quality of life of adolescents with obesity. Thus, the specific aims of the proposed research are: 1) to examine differences in weight- and race-based stigma between Black adolescents who have obesity without metabolic complications (OMC-) and matched Black adolescents who have obesity with at least 2 metabolic complications (OMC2+); 2) to evaluate differences in physiological stress and psychological stress between OMC- and OMC2+ adolescents; and 3) to explore differences in resilience between OMC- and OMC2+ adolescents. We will use a case-control cross-sectional design to conduct 100 interviewer-administered surveys with caregivers and Black adolescents with and without metabolic complications in the US Midsouth. We will examine two groups of Black youth (aged 11-17) with obesity (defined as having a waist circumference ≥90th percentile). The OMC- group will include 50 adolescents with obesity who have optimal levels of blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, and liver function. The OMC2+ group will include 50 adolescents with obesity who have two or more metabolic complications (i.e., high blood pressure, elevated triglycerides, low high density lipoprotein (HDL), insulin resistance, and/or impaired liver function) matched to OMC- youth by age and sex. Quantitative surveys will examine caregiver and youth reports of weight- and race-based stigma, psychological stress, and resilience. Physiological stress will be assessed via salivary cortisol (diurnal and awakening response). We will obtain data on metabolic function including: blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and liver function. Given known associations with study outcome variables, we will obtain measures of income, physical/mental health, and dietary intake, and as well as measures of physical activity and sleep patterns via actigraphy. This innovative study will contribute to the field's understanding of why some Black youth are not yet exhibiting metabolic complications while others are. While genetic factors may account for ~27% of these variations, biopsychosocial factors have been underexplored. Thus, by studying this rare group of OMC- adolescents, we will obtain data on mutable factors that are relevant to a community most impacted by obesity. Knowledge gained will serve as pilot data for an R01 grant to develop a strength-based, culturally-informed intervention aimed at decreasing health disparities and maintaining metabolic health among Black youth with obesity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past 30 years, soaring rates of adolescent obesity have become a major public health concern, with many, but not all, of these youth developing metabolic complications. By studying risk and resilience among Black adolescents who have obesity without metabolic complications, we will understand why some youth are able to maintain this lower risk state; thus providing knowledge about modifiable factors that could alter the progression to poor metabolic health. We aim to study differences in physiological stress, psychological stress, weight-based stigma, race-based stigma, and resilience between Black youth with and Black youth without obesity-related metabolic complications; with findings poised to inform the development of strength-based interventions for reducing health disparities and promoting metabolic health among adolescents.",The Impact of Stress and Resilience on Obesity-Related Metabolic Complications in Adolescents,9600552,R21DK113344,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fatty Liver ', ' hepatic steatosis ', ' Liver Steatosis ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertriglyceridemia ', ' elevated triglyceride ', ' elevated tg ', ' Triglycerides high ', ' Triglyceride increased ', ' Raised triglycerides ', ' Raised TG ', ' Hyperglyceridemia ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Interviewer ', ' High Density Lipoproteins ', ' alpha-Lipoproteins ', ' High density lipoprotein ', ' Heavy Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Lipoproteins ', ' HDL ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Sleep ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Physical activity ', ' liver function ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' impaired glucose tolerance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Body fat ', ' Knowledge ', ' Salivary ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' waist circumference ', ' psychosocial ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' case control ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' actigraphy ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' liver inflammation ', ' ANCOVA ', ' Analysis of Covariance ', ' metabolic rate ', ' adolescent health ', ' youth adiposity ', ' obesity in adolescents ', ' obesity in adolescence ', ' obesity during adolescence ', ' obesity among adolescents ', ' obese adolescents ', ' Adolescent obesity ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R21,2018,189929,0.06499806260439236
"Building Mobile Technologies to Reduce Health Disparities in Congenital Heart Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growing congenital heart disease adolescent survivor population faces two major health disparities in care: (1) poor care transition (an age and developmentally appropriate process, addressing the medical, psychosocial and educational/vocational aspects of care) from child-centered to adult-centered healthcare; and (2) lack of appropriate transfer of care (the point at which an adult cardiac provider assumes the medical care of a CHD patient). The transition period is a vulnerable time for adolescents with CHD, and many drop-out from active health care. Dropping out leads to poor health outcomes, and does not allow for appropriate transfer to adult care. The newly validated SMART (Socio-ecological Model of Adolescent & young adult Readiness for Transition) model has the potential to improve this process, by targeting modifiable variables for intervention in the transition and transfer process through assessments of five parameters: adolescent socio-demographics, disease characteristics and knowledge, skills/self-efficacy, relationships and psychosocial functioning. Using SMART, our research will engage CHD adolescents and promote transition and transfer using a modality that universally defines their generation: mobile technology. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify transition needs for CHD adolescents, facilitate transfer of care, and adapt SMART for these needs by developing and piloting an interactive e-health (mobile based) platform that will promote the key knowledge and skills that adolescents need to successfully transition and transfer to adult care. The mobile-based platform will target modifiable variables to improve transition and transfer of care for CHD adolescents. To achieve these goals, the Specific Aims include:  Aim 1: Complete a stakeholder needs assessment of CHD adolescents, parents, pediatric cardiology and adult congenital providers. We will assess baseline competencies in self-management, key skills, health literacy (HL), and transition readiness (TR) of CHD adolescents. Hypothesis: Low adolescent HL scores will correlate with low TR and low parental HL. Needs assessment will inform the educational content and design of our e-health platform.  Aim 2: Design and develop the educational content for a mobile e-health platform informed by:  modifiable variables in the SMART model, the existing literature on CHD knowledge gaps in adolescents,  the needs assessment, adaptation of an existing mentorship program, and varying levels of HL and TR. A formative iterative process with adolescents of various HL and TR levels will be used to further develop the content and design of this mobile-based e-health application to enhance adolescent transition.  Aim 3: Conduct a pilot study of the mobile-based platform to assess feasibility, adolescent recruitment and engagement, and facilitate the transition and transfer process. Improving transition and transfer are critical to successful long-term disease management and survival. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    The proposed research is relevant to public health because it addresses the needs of Americans who are surviving and living with congenital heart disease (CHD). This research plan is unique, timely, and of high public health significance as it applies mobile technologies to streamline transition and transfer of care for adolescents with CHD or other chronic diseases. Furthermore, it provides a strategy to reduce disparities in minority CHD populations and low health literacy families.",Building Mobile Technologies to Reduce Health Disparities in Congenital Heart Disease,9542886,K23HL127164,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Belief ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communication ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dropout ', ' Elements ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Survivors ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Health Transition ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' psychosocial ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' American ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' health application ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' efficacy testing ', ' e-Health ', ' eHealth ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile computing ', ' Pediatric cardiology ', ' adolescent health ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' palliate ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K23,2018,158565,0.11767519502130874
"Why Adolescent Latinas Attempt Suicide More than Other Females PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The disparities in suicidal behavior among American teenagers, particularly girls, have been documented now for over two decades. Since 1991, CDC surveys consistently show that adolescent Latinas attempt suicide at rates much higher than any other group of American adolescents. Even with three decades of surveys, no studies have systematically compared Latinas to other girls in order to understand the reasons Latinas’ propensity to suicidal behavior. While family dynamics often account for the suicide attempts of adolescents, we do not know what the qualitative differences in Hispanic family dynamics that influence daughters to attempt suicide more than peers. What, if any, are the substantive differences with non-Hispanic peers? The overarching goal of this developmental/exploratory application is to deepen knowledge of the higher likelihood of Latinas toward suicide attempts (SAs) in contrast to non-Hispanic peers. We will examine the influence of family dynamics on suicidal behavior among Latinas, and contrast the reports of Latinas with those of non-Latina attempters. This study examines intensively family functioning of female suicide attempters of Latino, non-Hispanic White, and African American cultural heritage using in-depth interviews with the girls and the primary female caregiver. Twenty adolescent-caregiver dyads in racial/ethnic groups will be recruited to address two aims: (1) explore the psychological vulnerability of teenage suicide attempters in three racial/ethnic groups and the life contexts that influenced suicidal behaviors. Data on individual susceptibility, viz., emotional vulnerability, family factors, and life context, that girls in each racial/ethnic group indicate influenced the suicide attempts, including thoughts, meanings, and interpretations will generate testable hypotheses about underlying reasons that increase Latina teens’ propensity to suicidal behaviors and why they choose this action; and (2) describe the life histories and trajectories of family dynamics that influenced the attempt for each racial/ethnic group. We will seek answers to such questions as, What are family-adolescent dynamics that shaped the suicidal behavior for each group? To what extent do Latinas’ and caregivers’ histories and trajectories differ from those of the two other racial/ethnic groups? This aim identifies variations in patterns of family dynamics and sociocultural elements that reveal differences in manifestations of suicide attempts across racial/ethnic groups. Achieving these two aims via this mechanism can set the stage for a larger study and inform preventive and intervention programs. PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE For over two decades, national surveys have shown ethnic-racial disparities in suicidal behavior among female adolescents, especially among Latinas, but the reasons for the persistence of these disparities are not known. By comparing the reasons for the suicidal behavior of Latinas with those of African American and non-Hispanic White females, this study will help explain partially why the disparities exist. Findings will be useful to developing efficacious and effective interventions for the prevention of suicide among girls that will reduce disparities in suicidal behaviors.",Why Adolescent Latinas Attempt Suicide More than Other Females,9572420,R21MD012338,"['Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Daughter ', ' Elements ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Family dynamics ', ' family structure/dynamics ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' suicidal ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' life history ', ' intervention program ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' girls ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Seminal ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' risk behavior in youth ', ' adolescent risk taking ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' ethnographic method ', ' family influence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' suicide attempter ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2018,185293,0.08132343660653496
"Iron Deficiency and Adversity in Early Life and Cardiometabolic Risk in Adulthood ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iron deficiency (ID) is associated with cardiovascular events such as stroke in children and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in adulthood. However, it is unknown whether ID in infancy contributes to the development of CVD and metabolic syndrome (cardio-metabolic risk). Studies of developmental effects of early ID demonstrate long-term negative effects on cognitive functioning, behavior, and socio-emotional development. Such changes may affect health behaviors that increase cardio-metabolic risk. Early adversity (e.g., poverty, maltreatment) is linked to higher cardio-metabolic risk and might also operate through similar cognitive, behavioral, and socio-emotional pathways. As ID is more common in low SES and other disadvantaged circumstances, a yet untested hypothesis is that there is a dual burden of having both ID and early adverse experiences that negatively affects functioning and subsequently increases cardio-metabolic risk. The goal of this project is to understand pathways between early ID and adversity and adult cardio-metabolic risk in order to identify targets for prevention and intervention and to detect subgroups at highest risk for disruptions in functioning and cardio-metabolic health. This goal will be accomplished using data from a large longitudinal study (n > 1000) of the effects of ID from infancy to early adulthood (PIs: Betsy Lozoff and Sheila Gahagan). Information on early ID and adversity (SES, life stress, maternal depression, father absence), adolescent cognitive functioning, health behaviors, and mental health, and adult cardio-metabolic risk (BMI, fat mass, blood pressure, blood lipids, hormonal regulators of metabolism) will be utilized. The first aim will test whether there are indirect effects of early ID on adult cardio-metabolic risk through pathways related to adolescent cognitive functioning, health behaviors, and mental health. The second aim will examine whether early adversity affects cardio-metabolic risk through similar or different pathways. The third aim will examine whether the dual burden of ID and adversity further increases cardio-metabolic risk in adulthood through these adolescent pathways. These aims will be accomplished with a training plan emphasizing the neurobiological and behavioral effects of early ID (sponsor Lozoff), childhood influences on cardio-metabolic risk (co-sponsor Gahagan), early adversity (Lozoff and Gahagan), and advanced statistical methods. Completing this research and training will be the first step in the PI's career plan to conduct policy-relevant research on the impact of nutrition and adversity on mental and physical health throughout the lifespan. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although prior research shows associations between early adversity, cardiovascular disease, and obesity, to date no study has examined whether iron deficiency (ID) early in life, which is more common in adverse environments, contributes to cardiovascular and metabolic risk indirectly through effects in adolescence. The current project tests the novel hypothesis that early ID and adversity increase cardiovascular and metabolic risk in adulthood through alterations in adolescent health behaviors, cognitive functioning, and mental health. If early ID contributes to greater cardiovascular and metabolic risk, especially for individuals experiencing early adversity, iron supplementation for infants in adverse environments may reduce disruptions in adolescent functioning and associated risks for cardiovascular disease and obesity.",Iron Deficiency and Adversity in Early Life and Cardiometabolic Risk in

"Prevention of Adolescent Risky Behaviors: Neural Markers of Intervention Effects Adolescence is a time of dramatic biological, behavioral and social changes. It is one of the healthiest periods of the life-span, yet morbidity and mortality rates increase 200%, often attributed to natural tendencies to explore and take risks that increase vulnerability to risky and dangerous behaviors. Rapid advances in developmental neuroscience are revealing new insights into how biology and social context interact to increase adolescents' risk-taking behavior which is attributed to a temporal disassociation between maturational changes in two distinct neural systems: “socio-emotional” (reward) and “cognitive-control” (self-regulation). The socio-emotional system is stimulated by a rapid increase in dopaminergic activity at puberty, which influences reward-seeking behavior. This increase in reward-seeking precedes the maturation of the cognitive-control system and its connections to the reward system. This proposal aims to apply these new insights on neurobiology of adolescents' responses to alcohol/drug use and sex-related risk opportunities by examining brain changes in response to a theoretically- based and empirically-tested prevention program that targets risky behavior in African-American youth during pubertal transition. This racial group is disproportionately affected by the high morbidity and mortality associated with HIV-related risky behaviors and exemplifies a significant health disparity in our society. The intervention was designed on the basis of developmental issues and socio-cultural contextual processes germane to African- American families, and has been shown in randomized controlled trials to delay/deter HIV-related risky behaviors in this vulnerable population. This proposal extends the efficacy studies of the intervention by using functional magnetic resonance imaging to quantify the biological changes in response to the intervention. Identifying neural substrates of the intervention can facilitate refinement of the program by focusing on the components that are most effective in changing behavioral and neural circuitry and also aid in the development of new interventions for subgroups of youth that don't have a positive outcome. Using a randomized controlled design, we will assess the neural substrates of risk-taking and risk-avoidant behavior before and after the 6-week computer-interactive, family-based intervention in 11-13 year-old African-American youth. Psychological processes shown to mediate the intervention effects on behaviors that dissuade alcohol and drug use and sexual onset (i.e. reward-drive and cognitive-emotional self-regulation) will be assessed at baseline and 3 months post-intervention. Based on prior studies that reported observable brain changes in response to psychosocial interventions, our hypothesis is that a positive response to the intervention will be associated with greater functional connectivity changes between the socio-emotional (reward-drive) and cognitive-control (self-regulation) components of the neural circuitry compared to the control condition, both at rest and during task-performance. We also postulate that these neural changes will mediate the intervention's positive effects on psychological processes involved in youth's decision to avoid HIV-risk vulnerability behaviors in the service of long-term personal goals and positive health outcomes. Adolescence is a time of biological and behavioral changes that can lead to risky and dangerous behaviors, and African-American youth are highly vulnerable to the consequences of risky behavior, including HIV/AIDS and violence, leading to premature death. We previously showed that an intervention program reduces HIV-risk vulnerability behaviors in many African-American youth. We aim to measure how the program affects different regions of the brain in order to better prevent or reduce such risky behaviors among African-American youth.",Prevention of Adolescent Risky Behaviors: Neural Markers of Intervention Effects,9518785,R01DA040966,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Computers ', ' Dangerous Behavior ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Family ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Cardiometabolic Health in Adolescents of South Asian Ancestry - the CHAriSmA study Project Summary/Abstract South Asians (SA), the fastest growing major ethnic group in the U.S., are also at greater type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk at relatively lower body mass index (BMI) compared to those of European and African ancestry. The mechanism(s) underlying this increased cardiometabolic risk remain undefined. We are submitting this research proposal in response to an NIH program announcement (PA-17-021) requesting proposals addressing health disparities in NIDDK diseases. The increased cardiometabolic risk in SA Americans represent an understudied and disparate risk. Mostly adult, associative studies performed outside the U.S. indicate that SA have higher % body fat, visceral adiposity, and abdominal adiposity for a given BMI than other ethnic groups. These studies have also found increased insulin resistance and dyslipidemia as well as decreased insulin-mediated glucose disposal (inversely proportional to visceral fat) and β-cell function in SA adults. We propose to study SA adolescents, in order to elucidate early mechanistic changes underlying their increased cardiometabolic risk. Given the unique fat distribution of SA, we propose to define ectopic fat deposition and test for altered fat metabolism and β-cell insulin secretion in SA adolescents in the U.S. We will use cutting-edge, innovative techniques, including MRI/MRS, mathematical modeling of free fatty acid (FFA) kinetics, and the glucose-potentiated arginine test (GPA) to measure insulin secretory capacity, methods not previously used in SA adolescents. We have assembled a highly experienced, multi-institutional (CNMC, CHOP, NIH), and multi-disciplinary team with a track record of successful collaboration, to perform a cross-sectional study of 12-21 year old adolescents and young adults of SA ancestry (n=50), BMI ≥ 85%ile, compared to adolescents of European ancestry (White) (n=50) and African American (AA) ancestry (n=50) of comparable age, sex, and BMI %ile. AA individuals are known to also have increased cardiometabolic risk but have decreased visceral adiposity, making them a unique comparison group. Aims: 1. To examine ancestry-related differences in body fat distribution (by MRI/MRS), FFA flux (by 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test and Minimal Model of fatty acid kinetics), and to compare the relationships between visceral adiposity and FFA flux among ancestral groups. 2. To examine ancestry-related differences in β-cell insulin secretory capacity (by GPA), and compare the relationship between FFA flux and insulin secretory capacity among groups. 3. To compare CVD and T2DM risk factors and vascular end organ injury (aortic pulse wave velocity) among the three groups, and test for ancestry-related differences in the relationships between FFA flux and cardiometabolic risk profile. Exploratory Aim: to compare adipocyte-derived exosomal microRNAs involved in insulin signaling among the groups, and measure their association with β-cell insulin secretory capacity, for hypothesis generation. Thus, this proposal will investigate whether associations between ectopic fat, FFA flux, and β-cell secretion vary by ancestry to impact cardiometabolic risk, with the expectation that this may eventually lead to ancestry-specific treatment options. PROJECT NARRATIVE South Asians (SA) (those with ancestral roots in India, Pakistan, the Maldives, Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka) are the fastest growing major ethnic group in the U.S., nearly doubling in numbers between 2000 and 2013. SA also have increased type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk at relatively lower body mass index compared to other ethnicities, but the mechanism(s) underlying this increased risk are not known. This study will investigate the possible connections between altered body fat distribution, fatty acid metabolism, and insulin secretion in SA compared to those of African American and European ancestries, to look for differences which in the future, may have implications for ancestry-specific treatments of disease.",Cardiometabolic Health in Adolescents of South Asian Ancestry -

"Mucosal injury from sexual practices: Behaviour and biology of South African adolescents ABSTRACT Globally and in sub-Saharan Africa, adolescent females are at highest risk for HIV. In this region, there are also high levels of gender-based violence and a cultural preference for dry sex. Young women in Southern Africa become sexually active at around 15 years of age similar to those in the US9 and UK10. Adolescence is associated with significant changes in hormone levels, resulting in changes in cervical anatomy that could put them at risk for HIV. Vaginal insertion practices (VIPs) are common in women in sub-Saharan Africa. These VIPs [including intravaginal use of cloth or paper, insertion of products to dry/tighten the vagina and intravaginal cleansing with soap were associated with increased risk for HIV infection5. In four different studies conducted in South Africa, VIP prevalence ranged from 17.9% to 90.1%, depending on the population studied, with the predominant practices being intravaginal washing with soap, cloth or tissue paper for cleansing5. Relationship power inequity and intimate partner violence increase risk of incident HIV infection in young South African women20 This study will evaluate the hypothesis that in adolescent women, sexual immaturity, use of vaginal products and gender-based violence increase genital inflammation, damage the mucosa, alter the vaginal flora, which influences genital HIV target cell availability. To address this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims using two cohorts of HIV-negative SA adolescents in regions differentially at risk for HIV infection and with differing cultural norms for vaginal product use. We propose to enroll 300 adolescent females (aged 14-19 years) and 100 adult women (aged 25-35) and cluster them according to VIP use: (1) nothing (control); (2) using cloth or paper to wipe out the vagina; (3) intravaginal cleansing with soap; (4) intravaginal cleaning with household cleaners; or (5) products to dry/tighten vagina. Information about exposure to gender-based violence will be collected through the questionnaire. At baseline, examination of the cervix; vaginal vaginal flora, and imunity will be assessed. All women will be followed longitudinally for two consecutive sexual exposures. Women will be evaluated at baseline, <48 hours following sex (trauma visit), and at 7 days (wound healing). Comparing each subject to their own baseline, to the control arm, and to adult women, and building on adolescent trial experience at both clinical sites involved are strengths of this study design. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1. To examine anatomical and immunological characteristics of the adolescent state that may contribute to higher inflammation in the reproductive tract, hence HIV risk 2. To compare inflammatory responses to VIPs and sexual violence in adolescent females and older women The study outlined here may uncover why African adolescents are so disproportionately affected by HIV and has the potential to dramatically influence public health messaging about VIPs and sexual violence to adolescents in developing countries. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, adolescent females are the highest risk group for HIV, and vaginal trauma potentially increases this risk. This proposal will evaluate the effects of adolescent genital biology and the effects of vaginal trauma on vaginal immunology and microbiome. The goal of these studies is to inform clinical trials and messaging for adolescent females in developing countries so that they can effectively prevent their risk of HIV infection.",Mucosal injury

"Speaking Their Language: Using Social Media and Texting to Create an Adolescent-Centered Approach to Healthy Weight Gain During Pregnancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tammy Chang, MD, MPH, MS is a family physician and junior clinical investigator focused on reducing obesity among adolescent mothers and their children. Dr. Chang's long-term career objective is to reduce health disparities among low-income adolescent mothers using tailored eHealth technologies. The objective of this K23 mentored career development award includes a 5-year plan for training and research activities that will provide the skills and experiences needed to become a successful independent investigator. RESEARCH CONTEXT: The United States (US) has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the developed world; the majority of pregnant adolescents gain excess weight during pregnancy. Excess pregnancy weight gain has a significant negative impact on the health of the adolescent mother, increases the risk of dangerous complications during delivery, and contributes to long-term obesity for both mother and child. In recognition of this important population health problem, both the IOM and AHRQ have identified the development of interventions targeting excess pregnancy weight gain as a major research priority. Compared to adults, relatively little is known about pregnancy weight gain among adolescents. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand adolescents' perceptions of and knowledge about pregnancy weight gain, so that researchers can customize interventions and make them relevant to the pregnant adolescent. The short-term goal of this proposal is to acquire the requisite skills to develop an adolescent-centered tailored eHealth intervention to reduce excess pregnancy weight gain. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Determine which US pregnant adolescents (aged ≤21 years) are at high risk for significant excess pregnancy weight gain; 2) Identify the baselin knowledge, beliefs, and factors that influence excess pregnancy weight gain among adolescents; and 3) Design and test a scalable healthy diet and exercise eHealth intervention tailored to at-risk pregnant adolescents. RESEARCH PLAN: To accomplish these aims, Dr. Chang will conduct analyses using nationally representative data from the Fragile Families and Wellbeing Study; carry out social media mining and corresponding qualitative interviews with pregnant and postpartum adolescents; and design, implement, and evaluate an adolescent- centered and tailored eHealth (tailored text-messaging) intervention. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Chang will broaden her knowledge of advanced statistical methods using a large nationally representative dataset; develop skills in mining and analyzing online social media data; acquire expertise in designing, implementing, and evaluating scalable interventions tailored to pregnant adolescents; and obtain experience in translating research findings into clinically relevant policies and practices. Dr. Chang's career development goals will be supported through close mentorship from an interdisciplinary team; guidance from an expert advisory panel; advanced didactic course work; attendance at professional meetings and workshops; participation in seminars and journal clubs; guidance in manuscript preparation and grant proposal development for projects arising from the research she conducts as part of this proposal; and implementing her research plan. This training will directly contribute to Dr. Chang's goal of addressing a vital intergenerational problem of excess pregnancy weight gain among at-risk adolescents, as well as the subsequent submission of a successful R01 application. ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Chang's unique resources include a dedicated and accomplished multi-disciplinary mentorship team with whom she has previously collaborated; the outstanding research infrastructure at the University of Michigan and Department of Family Medicine with a particular emphasis on supporting junior investigators; and numerous advanced didactic courses and seminars provided by several distinct academic units at the University of Michigan. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The US has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the developed world, and most pregnant adolescents in the US gain excess weight during pregnancy. Excess weight gain during pregnancy not only has a significant negative impact on the health of the adolescent mother, it increases the risk of dangerous complications during delivery, and contributes to long- term obesity for both mother and child. The overarching goal of this proposal is to promote healthy weight gain among pregnant adolescents by leveraging technologies adolescents use frequently, including online social media and

"Suicidal trajectories from early adolescence into young adulthood in a national sample PROJECT SUMMARY The impetus for this study rests on the need to understand how suicidal trajectories present from early adolescence into adulthood among a community-based, nationally representative sample. While longitudinal research among adolescent clinical samples has contributed to the literature, they often do not follow adolescents into adulthood and/or include particular higher-risk racial/ethnic groups. Clinical samples also include participants who have already disclosed their suicidal behaviors to professionals. Adolescents, especially particular racial/ethnic minorities, utilize mental health professionals and disclose to trusted adults less than non-Hispanic whites, which arguably heighten risk for suicidal behaviors. No study has tracked longitudinally, a representative sample of suicidal behaviors over the crucial developmental period of adolescence to young adulthood. This study contributes to the literature and aids in public health efforts, as these groups have not reported significant decreases in suicidal behavior in the past 25 years. The study will focus on a salient protective mechanism: developmentally appropriate social relationships. We propose that the heterogeneity of suicidal trajectories will not only help explain suicidal behavior disparities, but will aid in tailoring prevention initiatives based upon the onset of symptomology. This proposed work will create profiles that reflect the variation of suicidal behaviors, based on four independent levels of suicidal risk (1) no suicidal behaviors, (2) suicidal ideation yet no attempts, (3) suicide attempts (4) suicide attempts resulting in medical treatment. This work will examine whether particular profiles not only describe how specific subgroups are at a heightened risk in early adolescence, but also elucidate why some might be chronically suicidal and while others might first present suicidal behaviors later in life. The proposed study will use secondary analysis of the Add Health dataset to 1) describe the longitudinal patterns and progression of suicidal behaviors; 2) examine how social relationships and behavioral health are related to the escalation and de-escalation of suicidal behaviors, and 3) observe the heterogeneity of racial/ethnic and gender presentations in these suicidal behavior trajectories. Profiles will be identified through latent transition analysis. The proposed study will produce recommendations for how pediatricians and other health care providers, as well as educators, particularly in the context of gatekeeping and understanding suicidal risk factors, can support parents and other trusted adults in communicating effectively with their children about suicidal behaviors by (1) identifying which particular subgroups (race/ethnicity, gender and the intersectionality of these identities) are at the most need for upstream prevention messaging; and (2) targeting specific social relationships to capitalize on for help- seeking promotion during times of distress. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gender and racial/ethnic disparities are consistently found among adolescents engaging in suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

"Preventing IPV and Reproductive Coercion Among Underserved Adolescents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the candidate with training and research experiences that will promote her development as an independent clinician-researcher, with particular emphasis in the field of healthcare-based intervention research addressing gender-based violence, specifically reproductive coercion (RC), among medically underserved female adolescents in Mexico. This training will provide her with the opportunity to develop knowledge and skills in: 1) reproductive coercion (RC) epidemiology, assessment and prevention; 2) acquire knowledge in the theory, development, implementation, and adaptation of theoretically driven clinic-based behavioral interventions to reduce RC; 3) Acquire skills in multilevel modeling of longitudinal data to assess the efficacy of clinic-based behavioral interventions. Training activities will include didactic coursework and specific workshops, directed readings and one-on-one tutorials with mentors, and instruction in the responsible conduct of research. The candidate will receive mentorship from a Training Committee comprised of globally renowned experts in the fields of gender-based violence, reproductive coercion, adolescent health, healthcare-based screening and brief interventions for RC and epidemiology research. The present K23 research project emerges from the existing research infrastructure of Drs. Silverman and Miller's ARCHES (Addressing Reproductive Coercion in Healthcare Settings) intervention, specific aims are to conduct secondary data analysis of the sub-sample of adolescents (16-20 years old) from ARCHES and 1) Conduct epidemiologic research to estimate the prevalence and correlates of RC among US female adolescents ages 16-20 (n=1311) from the ARCHES intervention; 2) Conduct multilevel longitudinal data analyses of the ARCHES adolescent sample to evaluate the effect of the intervention on RC among this group; 3) Conduct qualitative research to identify barriers to and adapt the ARCHES intervention to improve the reproductive autonomy of female adolescents in urban health clinics in Tijuana (Mexico); 4) Implement the adapted ARCHES intervention for female adolescents in urban health clinics in Tijuana, pilot test its feasibility and estimate effect sizes needed for future lrge-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT). While the specified initial goal of this work is a clinic-based intervention model adapted for adolescent health care in Mexico, the candidates' longer-term goal is to expand implementation of such programs throughout Latin America and in other low and middle-income countries. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reproductive Coercion (RC) has been associated with numerous negative effects on the physical, sexual, and mental health of young women and girls, with RC prevalence the highest among adolescents; 20% of adolescent family planning (FP) clients reporting such abuse. Findings from the proposed research will be critical to the adaptation, implementation, and evaluation of theoretically driven, empirically informed behavioral interventions that address RC among adolescents in a Latin-American country (Mexico) that can be further applied to other settings. In addition, the proposed project will allo the candidate to master a complex set of research skills in development and evaluation of theoretically driven clinic-based interventions, and develop topical expertise required to fully characterize and reduce the impact of RC, and potentially unintended pregnancies among underserved female adolescents in Mexico and other low and middle-income

"Gender, Autonomy, and Contraceptive Use Among Young People DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career Goals: This is an application for a K01 Career Development Award in Population Research for Ushma Upadhyay, PhD, MPH, a Public Health Social Scientist at the University of California, San Francisco. Her preliminary research focuses on contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy, and includes the development of the first measure of reproductive autonomy, assessing a woman's power to decide about and control matters related to contraceptive use, pregnancy and childbearing. In the short term, she aims to build on this work, investigating the effect of gender-based power on contraceptive use among young people. In the long term, she aspires to conduct research that results in evidence-based interventions that help young people to control their fertility. The knowledge and experience she will gain from the K01 award will prepare her to compete for NICHD R01 funding to design a randomized intervention trial to test the effects of a gender-based power intervention on contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy among adolescents and young people. Environment: The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) provides generous support for junior faculty. UCSF researchers have a long history of pursuing innovative ideas in reproductive health. As an institution, it has been unequivocally supportive of research on contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy. Key Elements of Research Career Development Plan: Dr. Upadhyay has a rich background in epidemiologic and demographic methods, with substantial experience analyzing large datasets. This career development award will enable her to address several remaining gaps in her training specific to her career goals, and to gain applied experience planning and executing a primary data collection study on gender-based power and contraceptive use. Her training goals are to gain experience and expertise in sociological theories of gender among adolescents, qualitative research, advanced quantitative methods, and translating evidence into intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Upadhyay has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team. It includes a Primary Mentor, Tina Raine-Bennett, MD, MPH, a clinician scientist formerly at UCSF who is now Research Director of the Women's Health Research Institute at Kaiser Permanente specializing in adolescent unintended pregnancy and racial disparities, and co-mentor Shari Dworkin, PhD, MS, a medical sociologist in UCSF's Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences and an expert on gender- based power. Her team includes three additional, complementary advisors: Diana Foster, PhD, a demographer in UCSF's Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, who studies the consequences of unintended pregnancy; Torsten B. Neilands, PhD, a quantitative methodologist at UCSF's Center for AIDS Prevention Studies with expertise in latent variable (structural equation) modeling; and Claire Brindis, DrPH, Professor of Pediatrics and Health Policy whose research focuses on adolescent and child health policy, adolescent pregnancy and pregnancy prevention, and adolescent health and risk-taking behaviors. Dr. Upadhyay's training will include a combination of structured reading lists and tutorials with mentors, coursework, self-directed learning, conference presentations and attendance, and seminars. Description of the Research Project: Unintended pregnancy is an important public health problem; half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. The transition to adulthood is a particularly vulnerable period for unintended pregnancy; women ages 15 to 24 are at highest risk. One of the main reasons for unintended pregnancy is lack of consistent contraceptive use. The overall objective of this study is to conduct mentored research that examines the pathways between power, gender norms, and masculinities and contraceptive use among young people ages 15 to 24. My main hypothesis is that adherence to gender norms and traditional norms of masculinity lead to inconsistent and non-use of contraceptives. This research will assess this hypothesis through three specific aims. Aim 1 is to explore the role that relationship power, gender norms, and masculinities have in influencing adolescent and young people's contraceptive use. This aim involves qualitative in-depth interviews with adolescent and young women, men, and couples. Aim 2 is to adapt and validate existing instruments that measure relationship power, gender norms, and masculinities so that they are appropriate for adolescents and young people. This aim involves adapting my own Reproductive Autonomy Scale, the Gender Relations Scale, and the Masculinity Ideology in Relationships Scale for use among adolescents and young men and women. Aim 3 is to determine how relationship power, gender norms, and masculinities impact adolescent and young people's contraceptive use through a 3-month pilot prospective study at an adolescent family planning clinic. Examining gender-based power from the perspectives of multiple disciplines using mixed-methods, I expect to make important contributions in three areas: 1) theory on gender and power and contraceptive use, 2) measurement of gender-based power among adolescents, and 3) potential interventions that reduce unintended pregnancy. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare me for the successful submission of an R01 application to test an adolescent contraceptive use intervention and a research career in gender and power-related determinants of adolescent reproductive health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the United States, over 1.7 million young women ages 15 to 24 have an unintended pregnancy each year, leading to a range of negative health outcomes. The knowledge gained from this study will be used to guide potential interventions to reduce disparities in unintended pregnancy and help achieve the Healthy People 2020 goal of reducing the adolescent pregnancy rate by 10%.","Gender, Autonomy, and Contraceptive Use Among Young People",9490411,K01HD077064,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', '

"Sex hormone effects on neurodevelopment: Controlled puberty in transgender adolescents Project Summary/Abstract Sex represents a critical variable not only in typical neurodevelopment, but also neuropsychiatric disease. Substantial sex differences have been identified in prevalence, course and outcome of psychiatric disorders, with prior evidence indicating this occurs in a time-dependent fashion throughout the lifespan, with specific epochs in early development and in the pubertal period. Despite clear epidemiological evidence for these disparities, understanding of underlying biological mechanisms in humans is limited. Animal studies suggest a critical role of sex hormones in both developmental periods, however translation of these mechanisms to humans has been hampered by the lack of an experimental model that allows segregation of effects related to early organizational effects and later activational processes in puberty. The recent advent of cross-sex hormone therapy (CSHT) in adolescents with gender dysphoria, presents a unique opportunity to investigate these processes, while also advancing the empirical basis of clinical care for this vulnerable population of youth. While early data from comparable European clinics demonstrated that adolescents in late puberty receiving GnRH treatment showed improved psychological functioning and unanimously opted to proceed with CSHT in late adolescence, there is little to no empirical data guiding clinical practices of CSHT in early pubertal adolescents, highlighting the need for further research to address the critical knowledge gap in this cohort of youth. The research we propose has never been conducted in early pubertal adolescents, an important point given the prevailing theoretical framework which posits that hormonal effects are exerted in defined, time- sensitive developmental windows, with early and permanent organizational effects in the perinatal period, and further activational changes occurring during adolescence. Studying an adolescent cohort is critical for this population as it (1) establishes a neural basis for sex steroid influence in puberty as manifested in brain anatomy and connectivity through a model of gender dysphoria and cross-sex hormone therapy, (2) identifies independent processes by which estrogens and testosterone differentially affect individuals with a natal sex background of either female- or male-typical early organizational effects and (3) maps these findings onto behaviors that are most strongly associated with sexually dimorphic patterns of psychopathology in the adolescent period. Results from this interdisciplinary proposal will provide a much-needed foundation for understanding the longitudinal impact of treatments that are already being used in clinical settings and allow better understanding of risk factors associated with disease that emerges along sex-specific trajectories from the pubertal period, greatly improving clinical outcomes for both typically developing and GD youth. Project Narrative The relatively recent introduction of cross-sex hormone therapy for transgender youth represents a significant shift in clinical practices, however underlying mechanisms for these interventions are poorly understood, particularly during early stages of puberty. This study utilizes comprehensive approaches to examine cross-sex hormone effects on the brain throughout the pubertal period and aims to improve long-term clinical outcomes for transgender youth by elucidating how sex hormone therapy alters sex-specific risk for disease. Delineation of this paradigm also provides critical insight into the role of sex hormones in typical development and their impact on neural networks implicated in psychiatric disorders.",Sex hormone effects on neurodevelopment: Controlled puberty in transgender adolescents,9597181,R01MH115349,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' Moods ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Puberty ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Testing ', ' Testosterone ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Hormonal ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' Performance ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' sexual dimorphism ', ' sex dimorphism ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Brain region ', ' GNRH1 gene ', ' Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone ', ' LNRH ', ' Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone 1 ', ' GNRH1 ', ' GNRH ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' brain behavior ', ' mood regulation ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' gender dysphoric ', ' gender dysphoria ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' perinatal phase ', ' perinatal period ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,797651,0.10149737160562511
"The Social Context of Adolescent Marijuana Use: A Systems Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The continued rise in adolescent marijuana use and the limited effectiveness of interventions to prevent adolescent marijuana use may be due to the failure to recognize the complexity of peer relationships, including developmental shifts in the prominence of peers vs. romantic partners, changes within romantic relationships, and the interconnected relationship between peers and romantic partners, that lead to the uptake, continuation, and escalation of adolescent marijuana use. The candidate is an epidemiologist, who has been well trained in linear modeling and brings an understanding of the role of partner context on risk behaviors (i.e. condom use and concurrency). To become a successful independent investigator with a career focused on addressing the significant and complex problem of adolescent marijuana use, the candidate requires additional training on the etiology and trajectories of marijuana use and dependence, the development and impact of romantic and peer relationships on decision-making around health compromising behaviors, formal and practical training in complex System Dynamics and mathematical modeling, and a deep understanding of legal and ethical issues associated with adolescent substance use research. The long-term goals of the candidate are to become an independent investigator focused on improving adolescent health by identifying opportunities for health promotion and developmentally appropriate primary drug use prevention strategies. Marijuana use is a significant public health problem due to the breadth of health and social consequences associated with its use. Adolescent marijuana use may be an intractable problem because it is embedded in a complex system. The short-term goals of the candidate are to gain the knowledge and skills to apply a systems science approach to illuminate how the context of romantic relationships drives adolescents' uptake, continuation and escalation of marijuana use. To attain these short- and long-term goals, the training component of the award includes 4 activities: 1) develop expertise in the etiology, physiology and trajectories of adolescent and young adult marijuana abuse and dependence, 2) build a theoretical foundation of sexual, dating and romantic relationships over the course of heterosexual adolescent and young adult development, 3) gain advanced skills in systems science methods, including group model building and mathematical modeling, and 4) gain an understanding of the complex ethical issues involved in drug use research with vulnerable adolescents and young adults. The research component of the award is to quantify the influence of romantic partners on adolescent marijuana use, and to use systems science methodology to incorporate important complexities of peer socialization processes. Specific Aim 1 is to use longitudinal data to estimate the contribution of romantic partner and non-romantic peer influence on adolescent marijuana use. This knowledge will serve as the foundation for developing a quantitative System Dynamics model, which will examine whether there is an effect of romantic partners and the relative magnitude of romantic partners and non-romantic peer influence on frequency of adolescent marijuana use over time. Specific Aim 2 is to use participatory model building (e.g., convened group of multidisciplinary academic and community experts and a group of youth) to create a system diagram incorporating key components of the social system that drive an adolescent's uptake, continuation and escalation of marijuana use over time using an approach grounded in rich theory from diverse disciplines. Specific Aim 3 is to use the system diagram to develop a quantitative simulation model of peer system effects on marijuana use and calibrate the model with available data, including the empirical literature. Upon completion of this award, the candidate will become a productive investigator who has the necessary skills to conduct innovative and compelling interdisciplinary research focused on the etiology of drug use in adolescents. She will understand how social context, specifically the dynamic nature of adolescent romantic and non-romantic peer relationships, affects marijuana use. Model building may help identify feedback loops in the peer system that perpetuates disparities in health and social consequences. Findings from this work may identify leverage points in the system that may be novel, multi-disciplinary and ideally more modifiable than previously identified prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescent marijuana use is a significant health problem and is currently on the rise. Peers, romantic and non- romantic, are known to be great influences of marijuana use. The goal of this project is to incorporate important complexities of the peer influence process to understand how social context, specifically the dynamic nature of adolescent romantic and non-romantic peer relationships, affects adolescent marijuana use.",The Social Context of Adolescent Marijuana Use: A Systems Approach,9456700,K01DA035387,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Marijuana Dependence ', ' Cannabis Dependence ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Marijuana Abuse ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Physiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Socialization ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Social Network ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Discipline ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' uptake ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' peer ', ' intimate behavior ', ' intimacy ', ' member ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Legal ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' youth substance use ', ' substance use among youth ', ' substance use among adolescents ', ' adolescent substance use ', ' time use ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' peer influence ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' young woman ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' vulnerable adolescent ', ' marijuana use in adolescence ', ' marijuana use among adolescents ', ' cannabis use among adolescents ', ' Adolescent marijuana use ', ' cannabis use ', ' THC use ', ' THC co-use ', ' marijuana use ', ' model building ', ' adolescent health ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,184734,0.13356175825580957
"Social Network Analysis of Puberty, Activity Behaviors, and Health Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular and metabolic diseases are among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the US. There are also substantial disparities in cardiometabolic health depending upon racial/ethnic background and sex that can be traced back to adolescence, the developmental period when youth begin to choose their own social environments and start to make decisions that impact their current and future health. While adolescent physical activity (PA), screen time (ST), and sleep duration are known modifiable behavioral determinants of cardiometabolic health, pubertal timing can also shape an adolescent's activity behaviors, directly through their own behavioral choices, but also indirectly through the behavioral choices of their friends. Therefore, a reduction in disparities in cardiometabolic risk between population subgroups may be achieved by identifying the early social, biological, and behavioral pathways that shape later-life health. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the largest, most comprehensive longitudinal survey of adolescents ever undertaken, is an ideal dataset to test hypotheses about how adolescent social relationships and biological factors may interact to shape health as youth transition into adulthood. In the proposed research, we will use state-of-the-art statistical social network models that allow us to evaluate how the simultaneously changing structure of social relationships, changing friend activity behaviors, and pubertal timing within one's friendship group jointly shape adolescent activity behaviors as well as later-life cardiometabolic risk. An especially innovative aspect of this research is that we can use objectively-measured biomarker data in young adulthood to study the interaction of adolescent social network, biological, and behavioral precursors on later cardiometabolic health. Young adulthood represents an age when chronic illnesses begin to emerge, and when pre-disease pathways (indicated by objectively-measured hypertension, high sensitive C-reactive protein, cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin, and overweight/obesity) can be assessed to gain insight into the mechanisms by which social experiences influence future disease onset. With rich information on the contextual factors that shape human development and health, we can thus evaluate hypotheses regarding the joint importance of pubertal maturation, activity trajectories, and friends' pubertal maturation and activity trajectories on these markers of young adult cardiometabolic health. This proposal is responsive to PA-14-176 as research to identify: (1) social and biological mechanisms that promote positive sustainable health behaviors in children and youth, (2) contextual influences on lifelong health behaviors, and (3) sources of racial/ethnic and gender disparities in risk. Results from these secondary analyses in a nationally representative sample of 132 schools will allow us to adjudicate competing explanations for how adolescent social conditions are linked to adult health, identifying optimal network targets for a future intervention to reduce health disparities before the onset of chronic disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Activity behaviors change dramatically across adolescence, as youth experience the overt physical changes of puberty and begin to make decisions about their social settings that will impact their current and future health. In general, physical activity levels decline (especially in girls and racial/ethnic minority populations), screen time spent with televisions, video games, and computing devices increases, and sleep is truncated. Further investigation is needed to evaluate pathways through which adolescent activity behaviors, relationship environments, and pubertal development may interact to shape later cardiometabolic risks and racial/ethnic risk disparities; this will inform the design of new interventions that leverage social ties to interrupt the development of pre-disease pathways during the life course.","Social Network Analysis of Puberty, Activity Behaviors, and Health Disparities",9529004,R21NR017154,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Buffers ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Decision Making ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Glycosylated Hemoglobin ', ' Glycated Hemoglobins ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Development ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Joints ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Puberty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Television ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Games ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Friendships ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Shapes ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' behavior change ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' Health and Behavior in Children ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Interruption ', ' Subgroup ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' tv watching ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' social regression ', ' adjudicate ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' peer influence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' network models ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' pubertal timing ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' young woman ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' adolescent health ', ' gender disparity ', ' secondary analysis ', ' adequate sleep ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R21,2018,213756,0.12852739331377502
"Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to Reach Vulnerable Young Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Vulnerable female adolescents in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town who use alcohol and other drugs (AOD) and have dropped out of school experience the greatest burden of new HIV infections in South Africa. The risk for acquiring HIV is perpetuated through intersecting factors of AOD use, gender inequality, sexual risk, victimization, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence. Despite the pervasive ongoing transmission of HIV, this vulnerable population remains underserved by current HIV and drug treatment programs, with few providing HIV testing and counselling (HTC), antenatal care, or substance abuse rehabilitation, and none providing comprehensive HTC programs that address these intersecting risks for HIV among this population. Since 2001, we have adapted and conducted a comprehensive evidence-based intervention for women, the Women's Health CoOp (WHC), that addresses AOD use, sexual risk, and gender-based violence. The WHC was listed in the USAID Compendium of Gender Studies in Africa. The Young Women's CoOp (YWC) is an adaptation of the WHC that targets this vulnerable population of AOD using female adolescents. This proposed RFA project seeks to reach this hard-to-reach population and overcome barriers to improved health for female adolescents who have dropped out of school by increasing update of HTC through a comprehensive gender-focused HTC intervention with trained peer co-facilitators and outreach workers from each community. The study findings may provide knowledge that could be used to increase the uptake of services and improve treatment adherence among female adolescents through the use of peer-driven intervention methods. Specific Aims: Our specific aims including the following. In a cluster randomized trial conducted in 12 disadvantaged communities in Cape Town, South Africa, and with government collaboration, we propose: Aim 1. To train and evaluate adolescent peer role models to conduct community outreach with established outreach workers to recruit 500 out-of schools, substance-using female adolescents aged 15-19 for HTC, and to co-facilitate a gender-focused comprehensive HTC program. Aim 2. To test the efficacy of a young women's gender-focused comprehensive HTC program for reducing substance use, victimization, and sexual risk behavior (primary outcomes) and improving access to effective treatment and support services through linkages to care (substance abuse treatment, HIV, STIs, antenatal and reproductive health as secondary outcomes) relative to standard HTC for adolescent females. This study's collaboration with the Western Cape-Department of Social Development and the City of Cape Town will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention within community centers will most likely ensure greater sustainability where it is needed most. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact for the proposed study is tri-fold and described as follows. First, reaching 500 adolescent females in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town with its high rates of school dropout (and often consequent unemployment), substance use, gender inequality, sexual risk, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence is essential for HTC and risk reduction, as these intersecting risk factors appear to be antecedents to the overwhelming gender differences in HIV prevalence among young women relative to men in this region. Second, this study's collaboration with the WC-DoSD will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention and is likely to ensure sustainabiliy of the intervention within communities. Third, determining the efficacy of the comprehensive gender intervention for greater application will be essential for the most at-risk female adolescents.",Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to

"AN EXAMINATION OF AGE-RELATED DISPARITIES IN MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT AND ASSOCIATED OUTCOMES Abstract The opioid partial agonist buprenorphine (BUP) is a highly effective but vastly under-utilized maintenance treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). Under-utilization of BUP is especially pronounced in the adolescent and young adult populations. For example, only a few percent of adolescents with OUD receive buprenorphine, even though it is FDA-approved for treatment of patients ages 16 and older. Both the American Society for Addiction Medicine and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend BUP treatment for adolescents but emphasize that a stronger evidence base for youth treatment is needed. The objectives of this project are to quantify and characterize age-related disparities in utilization of buprenorphine and other medication assisted treatments (MATs) and to acquire evidence about the effectiveness of MATs among adolescents and young adults with OUDs. Specifically, we will analyze treatment and outcomes data from a commercial insurance claims database with data from more than 50 million privately insured individuals. Using “big data” will allow us to examine MAT patterns even among adolescents, despite low MAT prevalence. The large data set will allow us to acquire knowledge about real-world MAT effectiveness among youth that will complement the limited evidence available from randomized trials. In Aim 1, we will assess the prevalence of MAT among individuals diagnosed with OUD by age, type of treatment, length of treatment (i.e., maintenance vs. detoxification only) and over time. We will examine the demographic and geographic correlates of MAT utilization, with particular emphasis on how prevalence has changed over time and how they might vary by age. We will examine use of different types of medication and medication change patterns (e.g., switching from buprenorphine to naltrexone). This will be an important first step in documenting and characterizing age-related disparities in MAT. In Aim 2, we will compare outcomes of MAT and non-MAT treated youth with OUD. We will use survival analysis to compare time to claims for relapse events. We will examine whether associations between MAT treatment trajectory and relapse outcomes vary by age, contrasting adolescents, young adults, and adults over 25. We will use both conventional propensity score matching and more advanced quasi-experimental methods. The latter analyses will leverage quasi-random variation in MAT prevalence by place and time to compare outcomes among groups of treated individuals with appropriately matched groups from environments where treatment is rare. Execution of this two-year project will be a critical first step toward a marked expansion of the evidence-base for MAT among adolescents and young adults that will provide critical information about promising treatments for a grave public health problem. Project Narrative Only a few percent of adolescents with opioid use disorder receive buprenorphine maintenance treatment even though it is believed to be effective in this age group. Young adults are under-treated as well. One reason for this—particularly in the case of adolescents—may be lack of evidence for effectiveness: There is very little clinical trial data from adolescent populations for buprenorphine or other medication assisted treatments (MAT). This project will use data from a large database of insurance claims to provide the first characterization of MAT patterns among young people with opioid use disorder, and will provide knowledge about real-world MAT effectiveness among youth that will complement the limited evidence available from randomized trials.",AN EXAMINATION OF AGE-RELATED DISPARITIES IN MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT AND ASSOCIATED OUTCOMES,9552770,R21DA044744,"['FDA approved ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' medication-assisted treatment ', ' study population ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Time trend ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opioid overdose ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' insurance claims ', ' Opioid substitution treatment ', ' Opioid substitution therapy ', ' Opioid replacement treatment ', ' Opioid maintenance treatment ', ' Opioid maintenance therapy ', ' Opiate substitution treatment ', ' Opiate substitution therapy ', ' Opiate replacement therapy ', ' Opioid replacement therapy ', ' buprenorphine treatment ', ' Academy ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Maintenance ', ' Matched Group ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' detoxification ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Methadone ', ' Methadose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Althose ', ' Adanon ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Vivitrol ', ' ReVia ', ' Nemexin ', ' Nalorex ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Population Density ', ' Public Health ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Agonist ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' age difference ', ' social ', ' Effectiveness ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Older Population ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' economic outcome ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,190625,0.12252960449626013
"Health and Psychosocial Need: The Ascenze study of risk and protection in adolescence South Africa (SA) has the largest HIV epidemic globally, and is simultaneously affected by poverty, inequality, violence and other legacies of Apartheid. Children growing up in disadvantaged communities affected by HIV are at high risk for cognitive, behavioral, health and educational problems that, in turn, increase their risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV. This study has the long-term goal of halting the devastation of the HIV epidemic by intervening to promote better cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial functioning of adolescents in SA. We will use a socio-ecological model with a life course perspective to prospectively investigate factors linked to drug use, binge drinking and unprotected sex including adolescent attributes such as executive function, and past and current family and contextual factors.  The population-based Asenze cohort of 4-6 year old children and their primary caregiver, funded through R01 DA023697, will form the study sample. They reside in five disadvantaged areas in KwaZulu-Natal. The children, born between 2004 and 2006, were previously assessed at two time points on cognitive, bio- medical, and psychosocial functioning and their caregivers were interviewed about caregiver HIV, mental health, substance use, stress, support, household assets and household substance use. Over 25% of caregivers were HIV+; 9% reported binge drinking, 31% screened positive for a psychiatric disorder, over 30% had experienced partner violence and 17% reported that someone in the household had a drinking problem. Only 9% of households contained an adult who had completed secondary school.  The Asenze cohort, reaching adolescence between 2017-2019, provides a unique opportunity to investigate the early-life origins of adolescent risk behavior in a disadvantaged population while building a strong foundation for later investigations into adulthood. We will investigate the pathways through which adolescent executive function and impulsivity, interact with both early and current social context (including their family adversity, disorganization and support as well as the behavior of their friends) affect the initiation of risky behaviors (drug use, binge drinking and unprotected sex). We will link the childhood cohort assessments of development and early adversity to those to be collected in both early and mid adolescence, including cognitive development, executive function and the initiation of risky behaviors. The findings will be crucial for informing critical prevention programs to halt the spread of HIV and promote healthy adolescent functioning.  We will build research capacity through mentoring and training emerging South African scientists, masters, doctoral and post-doctoral students to build research expertise focused on investigating the impact of adolescent neurocognitive development on the initiation of risky behaviors, which result in negative education and sexual health outcomes, including HIV infection. We will also develop a SA research network of investigators working with cohort studies to promote their use in neuroscience and mental health outcomes.   Leslie Davidson and Chris Desmond, co-PIs Narrative: Health and Psychosocial Need: Being submitted to Fogarty in response to PAR 14-332 The Asenze study of adolescent risk and protection will investigate how early and current family and social strengths and difficulties impact the adoption by South African teenagers of risky behaviors (drug use, binge drinking, unprotected sex), behaviors that will sharply increase their chances of HIV infection and other negative outcomes such as school failure or adolescent pregnancy. We will measure their ability to think things through, to plan and to resist impulses, abilities that will affect whether or not they engage in risky behaviors. Because we will follow-up 1581 children whom we have already assessed twice in childhood, we know a great deal about them, their childhood experiences and family life and this information will be extremely useful in developing interventions to prevent harmful behaviors and to protect adolescents from becoming part of an ongoing HIV epidemic.",Health and Psychosocial Need: The Ascenze study of

"Improving adolescent health by assessing in-session communication patterns ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic Americans in general and Hispanic youth in particular, carry a disproportionate share of the burden of substance use in the United States. Hispanic youth are also less likely than are Caucasian youth to benefit from treatment for alcohol and other drug (AOD) use. It remains unknown why this disparity persists after treatment. Two potential factors in this disparity are therapist behaviors and communication patterns during treatment sessions for AOD use. Previous research in adults has demonstrated a causal chain between therapist behavior, client behavior, and AOD outcomes. If therapists behave differently with Hispanic and Caucasian youth, then supervisors, trainers, and educators would have concrete behavioral targets to measure and change therapist behavior to improve these disparate outcomes for Hispanic youth. The proposed secondary analysis relies upon Eco developmental theory (Szapocznik & Coatsworth, 1999) to make specific predictions about within-session behaviors and processes. This study will use an advanced psychotherapy process research technique, sequential coding, to measure within-session behaviors of therapists and clients to test these hypotheses about how communication patterns and therapist behaviors may vary between Hispanic and Caucasian youth in an existing sample of 506 recorded psychotherapy sessions with adjudicated youth, and to link these behaviors to AOD outcomes.  Using this large, existing sample of audio recordings from Project AMICA, a large randomized controlled trial to assess health disparities, complete with demographics, psychosocial assessments, and outcome data, will provide an unusual opportunity for a large, low-cost and high-impact study to examine health disparities effects. Evaluating client and therapist language in this study presents a unique opportunity to measure communication patterns from a randomized controlled trial of motivational interviewing with justice- involved youth. The proposed 4-year analysis of existing recordings will test a causal chain developed in adult populations, using an adolescent sample and comparing those effects for Hispanic and Caucasian youth, an approach that will guide clinical practice by either corroborating or challenging current approaches to psychotherapy for AOD use with Hispanic youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanic youth generally, and adjudicated Hispanic youth in particular, suffer from higher rates of lifetime and current alcohol and cannabis use than do non-Hispanic youth, and do not benefit as much from addiction treatment. Some of this health disparity may be due to differences in the ways that substance use clinicians interact with Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic clients during treatment sessions. Investigating these within-session behaviors and communication patterns in an existing sample of 506 recorded treatment sessions may help us to modify existing treatments so that they are more effective with Hispanic youth, which could potentially translate into substantial savings in public health dollars.",Improving adolescent health by assessing in-session communication patterns,9434997,R01MD009708,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Justice ', ' Language ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Probability ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Savings ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Drug user ', ' Speech Therapist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' peer ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' drinking ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' demographics ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' sexual risk taking ', ' cannabis use ', ' THC use ', ' THC co-use ', ' marijuana use ', ' improved outcome ', ' adolescent health ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,R01,2018,349122,0.0182008150324474
"Emotional Wellbeing and Reproductive Health in a Prospective Study of Multiple Generations of Immigrant Latino Youth Project Summary/Abstract  This is an application for a K23 award for Marissa Raymond-Flesch, MD, MPH, whose research focuses on the reproductive health and health disparities of Latino adolescents. She has completed three primary data collection projects utilizing community-engaged qualitative methods and has been contributing to the Salinas Teen Health Study, on which this application builds, for the past two years. Her research training includes a masters of public health and fellowships in Adolescent Medicine and Health Policy. Through the activities proposed in this application Dr. Raymond-Flesch will build skills in cross-sectional and longitudinal quantitative data analysis. She will benefit from UCSF's nationally recognized Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine and Institute for Health Policy Studies as well as the university's course work in biostatistics and research methodology. In addition, UCSF will continue to support her productive collaboration with the Salinas Teen Health Study team at RTI. Across these intuitions Dr. Raymond-Flesch has established an experienced mentoring team with expertise in epidemiology, mixed methods research, and adolescent reproductive and mental health. By the completion of this award she will be well positioned to launch a career as an independent investigator, including applying for an R01 award.  Informed by the social ecological model, this proposal builds on the Salinas Teen Health Study (R01- HD075787), a prospective cohort study of 600 Latino adolescents over two years as they transition from early to middle adolescence in a Californian agricultural community. Latino youth experience a variety of health disparities, including higher rates of depression and adverse reproductive health outcomes (unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections). Current evidence links depression with negative sexual and reproductive health outcomes in adults, but there is a paucity of research on these associations in Latino adolescents. Additionally, data on how immigrant generation affects these outcomes for Latino adolescents are limited. Dr. Raymond-Flesch's specific aims include a quantitative analysis of the associations between depressive symptoms and sexual and reproductive health outcomes at baseline across first, second, and third generation Latino early adolescents (Aim 1); longitudinal analysis of two years of quantitative data to determine the effect of depressive symptoms during early adolescence on subsequent sexual and reproductive health (Aim 2); qualitative analysis of youth interviews to describe how emotional wellbeing influences sexual and reproductive health (Aim 3); and qualitative interviews with mothers to characterize early environmental and structural factors affecting emotional wellbeing, psychosocial development, and sexual and reproductive health for Latino youth (Aim 4). The roles of immigrant generation and protective family influences will be examined across all aims. At the conclusion of this award Dr. Raymond-Flesch will apply findings to the development of a R01 application for a culturally informed intervention to reduce mental and reproductive health disparities. Project Narrative Public Health Relevance Latinas have disparately high rates of pregnancy compared to all other racial and ethnic groups of adolescents, with rates highest in California among rural populations, despite falling rates of teen pregnancy nationally. Factors such as emotional health and immigrant generation likely impact engagement in the high risk sexual and reproductive health behaviors that give rise to high rates of teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and other poor health outcomes for these youth, but additional research is needed to understand the individual, family, and structural factors that give rise to these disparities, particularly for youth in agricultural communities. This study uses quantitative and qualitative methods, including questionnaires and interviews with youth and mothers, to prospectively investigate the individual, family, and structural factors that either promote positive youth development or place youth at risk for high risk sexual and reproductive health outcomes such as pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.",Emotional Wellbeing and Reproductive Health in a Prospective Study of Multiple Generations of Immigrant Latino Youth,9431012,K23HD093839,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescent Medicine ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Language ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Parents ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' adolescents who are pregnant ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Rate ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rural Population ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Partner Communications ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' eighth grade ', ' 8th grade ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Contraception ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' positive youth development ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' career development ', ' psychosocial development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Master of Public Health ', ' M.P.H.

"Mechanisms of Health Promotion in Diverse Youth Through Gay-Straight Alliances ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth face serious health risks that constitute costly public health concerns. There has been strong documentation of sexual orientation-based disparities on depression, anxiety, and substance use, all of which heighten risk for suicidal ideation and attempts. Further, racial/ethni minority LGBT youth contend with discrimination from multiple marginalized statuses and may face even greater health risks. Yet, there is also a paucity of research on this population. Professional organizations have emphasized the need to consider how social systems contribute to or mitigate health disparities among LGBT populations. Schools are a central access point for resources that may benefit LGBT youth. Few studies, however, have considered school-based programs that address sexual orientation-based health disparities. Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs) - school-based groups in which LGBT and heterosexual youth receive support and advocate for safer schools - have grown exponentially and serve many youth. Yet, they operate without empirically supported strategies. There are virtually no data on how GSA involvement attenuates negative health outcomes or whether youth from other marginalized backgrounds (e.g., racial/ethnic minority youth, either LGBT or heterosexual) derive benefits. There is a pressing need for data in order to develop effective GSA-based interventions and best practices in general. The current project addresses these gaps. This project is among the first to test how GSA involvement is associated with health outcomes through multiple pathways. It takes advantage of multi-informant data from youth and adults and utilizes quantitative and qualitative data. Data will be gathered from 400 GSA-involved youth (both LGBT and heterosexual) and their GSA advisors among a racially and ethnically diverse sample in 40 GSAs, interviews among 32-40 youth stratified across race/ethnicity, and from a nonmember comparison sample from the same schools. The first aim is to rigorously compare GSA members and nonmembers on health and school outcomes by comparing demographically and socially similar youth in the same school and controlling for confounders. The second aim is to capture variability among GSA members by testing mechanisms by which GSA involvement mitigates negative outcomes. The third aim is to identify race/ethnicity-specific GSA factors that mitigate negative outcomes particularly for racial/ethnic minority youth. Given the growing national presence of GSAs, this knowledge stands to benefit many youth by identifying critical factors underlying health promotion and by providing empirically-based recommendations for best practices to maximize GSA effectiveness. Results will provide a foundation for developing and systematically testing GSA-based interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research has the potential for high public health impact to address health concerns among youth from multiple minority groups, including LGBT and racial/ethnic minority youth. It focuses on the ways in which involvement in Gay-Straight Alliances - prominent school-based groups that provide support for these youth - reduces sexual orientation- and race/ethnicity-based health disparities on depression, anxiety, and substance use. This knowledge will be critical for improving health-related interventions among these youth populations.",Mechanisms of Health Promotion in Diverse Youth Through Gay-Straight Alliances,9513322,R01MD009458,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional society ', ' professional membership ', ' professional association ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Rural ', ' Gays ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Attenuated ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' System ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' physical assault ', ' physical attack ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' informant ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' comparison group ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON COLLEGE,R01,2018,309699,0.014106005476114588
"Reducing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption among young adults: A point-of-selection experiment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of adolescent and adult obesity is higher than it has ever been in the U.S, driving population risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Robust evidence indicates that consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) increases the risk of developing obesity. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Academy of Medicine have called for broad action to reduce SSB consumption, little is known about how to effectively do so in the age group that consumes the greatest amount of SSBs— older adolescents and young adults. One promising and potentially scalable approach is the use of SSB health warning labels. Although the effect of warning labels on SSB consumption has not yet been studied, warning labels have successfully been used to curb smoking, and in recent online experiments, were found to reduce hypothetical selection of SSBs. This study proposes to use qualitative methods and a formative experiment to develop a legally viable and salient SSB warning label format for adolescents and young adults. Then, a quasi- experimental design will test the impact of a prominent front-of-dispenser SSB warning label on university students’ beverage consumption, comparing outcomes in an intervention cafeteria to those in a control cafeteria. The college setting provides a feasible means of reaching close to half of all 18-to-24 year olds in the U.S. I am pursuing the NIDDK K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to fill critical training gaps in (1) the design, conduct, and analysis of intervention studies and (2) understanding of factors driving consumer decision-making. This award will build upon my advanced training in nutritional epidemiology and development of measures to assess dietary intake and food environments. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator who will reduce the prevalence of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases by identifying a spectrum of scalable and effective interventions that can “nudge” consumers toward healthier dietary choices. The skills I seek to obtain will be critical in achieving this goal. My detailed training plan includes formal coursework at UC Berkeley and UCSF, mentored experience, meetings, seminars, and directed readings. The research component of this project will provide opportunities to integrate new knowledge into practical research experience. Together, the training and protected time provided by the K01 award, combined with the rich collaborative environment and strong institutional support at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, will facilitate my transition into an independent investigator who can successfully compete for R01 funding. It will also provide the means to help me become a leader in the development and testing of scalable food environment and policy interventions that will reduce population risk of diet-related chronic diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE The prevalence of adolescent and adult obesity is higher than it has ever been in the U.S., and strong evidence indicates that sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are a major contributor to unhealthy weight gain and type 2 diabetes. Little is known about scalable approaches to reduce SSB consumption in older adolescents and adults, but a promising approach used in tobacco control that has been unstudied for SSB consumption is product warning labels. The proposed study will test the impact of SSB health warning labels on SSB consumption among adolescents and young adults in a cafeteria setting, which, if found to be effective, may be an approach scalable to policy and defined locations like colleges and workplaces.",Reducing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption among young adults: A point-of-selection experiment,9453510,K01DK113068,"['Academy

"Implementing mental health interventions for pregnant adolescents in primary care LMIC contexts SUMMARY High prevalence of adolescent pregnancies in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) has resulted in a tremendous public health burden. Many adolescent pregnancies are unwanted, unplanned, and outside of marriage. When adolescent girls become mothers, their opportunities for economic and educational growth are limited. A burgeoning number of adolescent mothers from LMICs are also marginalized due to poverty or gender-based traditions, which further limit their access to health resources, social protection/ support and personal development. Structural inequalities and adverse circumstances have resulted in high prevalence of depression in adolescent mothers. Despite the enormous mental health needs for adolescent mothers in LMICs, child and adolescent mental health service remains in its’ infancy. There is a need to advance cultural and context-sensitive perinatal depression interventions that can align with adolescents’ living contexts and developmental needs and simultaneously address multiple resource challenges in provision of mental health care in LMIC settings. This application seeks to respond to these adolescent perinatal depression intervention and implementation research gaps by i) utilizing WHO Mental Health Treatment Gap Action Program (mhGAP) and Group Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-G) depression care packages that has shown to be efficacious for adult depression, and further test the approaches in adolescents with perinatal depression in Kenyan maternal and child health (MCH) service settings. Three key research questions will be studied: (i) how to improve fit of the mhGAP/IPT-G-depression intervention model for pregnant adolescents in Kenya, (ii) how to effectively integrate task-shifting/sharing and collaborative strategies with MCH clinical workflow to implement mhGAP/IPT-G depression intervention for pregnant adolescents in MCH settings, and (iii) whether the adapted mhGAP/IPT-G are feasible-acceptable-effective in addressing perinatal depression in adolescents. Considering the demand-resource gap, as MCH clinics usually serve high volume of adolescents with perinatal depression but have limited resources, this study will also explore other cost-effective strategies, such as study feasibility of applying long and mini version of IPT-G and other family/adolescent peer co-lead approach of intervention implementation. This study will be carried out using a cross-disciplinary partnership approach. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) explore barriers and strategies to improve mhGAP-IG/IPT-G fit and implementation for adolescent perinatal depression in MCH clinics in Kenya; 2) Develop adapted version of IPT-G/ and mhGAP-IG, and build MCH capacity for implementation; and 3) test feasibility and implementation-effectiveness outcomes for the adapted version of mhGAP-IG/ IPT-G.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Pregnant adolescents in Sub-Saharan-African (SSA) are burdened by significant unmet health needs including lack of access to mental health services. This study seeks to enrich WHO’s mental health depression intervention with culturally and developmentally sensitive implementation strategies in primary care settings. This study aligns closely with the NIMH strategic plan, Kenya Vision 2030, UN SDGs, and WHO mhGAP framework, and its results will advance implementation research and yield need knowledge and tools for addressing similar global health gaps in other LMICs.",Implementing mental health interventions for pregnant adolescents in primary care LMIC contexts,9596085,K43TW010716,"['Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Community Developments ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Institutes ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Kenya ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Manuals ', ' Marriage ', ' Maternal-Child Health Services ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Tests ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Poverty ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' adolescents who are pregnant ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Unwanted pregnancy ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Gender ', ' Adolescent Health Services ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' mental health organization ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' teenage mom ', ' teen mother ', ' teen mom ', ' adolescent mother ', ' teenage mother ', ' African ', ' Social Protection ', ' Inequality ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Palpable ', ' palpable disease ', ' Services ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' offspring ', ' research study ', ' pregnant teen ', ' teens who are pregnant ', ' pregnant adolescent ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' reproductive ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Health system ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' implementation research ', ' effectiveness research ', ' youth depression ', ' pediatric depression ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' child depression ', ' interpersonal psychotherapy ', ' interpersonal therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' 18 year old ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' vulnerable adolescent ', ' perinatal depression ', ' peripartum depression ', ' support tools ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' service gap ', ' Service setting ', ' service delivery ', ' Child Health ', ' implementation strategy ', ' perinatal phase ', ' perinatal period ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI,K43,2018,102600,0.01023598057586466
"mHealth Intervention via Mentors: Preventing Substance Use, Sexual Risk and Violence among Inner City Youth through Technology-Enhanced Mentoring PROJECT SUMMARY This K01 proposal, “mHealth Intervention via Mentors: Preventing Substance Use, Sexual Risk, and Violence among Inner City Baltimore Youth through Technology-Enhanced Mentoring,” addresses two fields of study relevant to adolescent health that deserve further attention, particularly in how they can intersect to improve public health: youth mentoring and mobile health (mHealth) prevention interventions. Adolescents growing up in low-income urban areas such as Baltimore are at particularly high risk for unhealthy practices such as substance use, sexual risk, and engagement in violence. For adolescents who lack socially protective resources such as parents, attentive teachers, or community networks, mentors can play a significant role in helping to reduce stress, prevent negative health behaviors, and model positive health behaviors. However, little is known about the pathways by which mentee health behavior change occurs, especially for the prevention of substance use, how matched mentors can effectively communicate health promotion messages, or how mHealth technology might be leveraged to enhance existing mentoring models. Utilizing knowledge and training gained through this award in the areas of adolescent substance use, mHealth interventions, and analysis of dyadic and “big” social media and smartphone data, the goal of the proposed study is to develop a prevention intervention in the form of a smartphone application (app), as well as training materials for using the app, to enhance existing mentoring models for highly vulnerable African American male adolescents in urban Baltimore. The training, professional development, and pilot data gained under this award will allow me to propose an R01 to conduct a naturalistic study or randomized controlled trial to measure effect sizes in the reduction of substance use and related health risk behaviors among mentored adolescent males. Support under a K award and the linked career development experiences will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on a new area of expertise—substance use prevention with urban American youth using mHealth—and to learn the skills required for successfully pursing NIH research funding. My long-term career goal is to answer the following research questions: 1) How can mentoring help improve health outcomes for at-risk adolescents and reduce health disparities in adulthood? and 2) How can mHealth be used in prevention intervention with this population? Fully understanding how to set up a systematic research program that intersects the fields of youth mentoring and effective mHealth intervention has great potential to lead me towards an innovative and productive independent research career in a new area. My intermediate career goals under this training grant are to focus work locally with African American adolescent males in Baltimore City, understand how technology-enhanced mentoring can serve as a universal prevention tool for urban male adolescents, build capacity to analyze dyadic data and data produced by social media and smartphone applications, and to develop collaborations with leading investigators in substance use prevention, youth mentoring, and mHealth research. PROJECT NARRATIVE For adolescents who lack socially protective resources such as parents, attentive teachers, or community networks, mentors can play a significant role in helping to reduce stress, prevent negative health behaviors, and model positive health behaviors. However, little is known about the pathways by which mentee health behavior change occurs, especially for the prevention of substance use, how matched mentors can effectively communicate health promotion messages, or how mobile health (mHealth) technology might be leveraged to enhance existing mentoring models. The goal of the proposed study is to develop a prevention intervention in the form of a smartphone application (app), as well as training materials for using the app, to enhance existing mentoring models for highly vulnerable male adolescents in urban Baltimore.","mHealth Intervention via Mentors: Preventing Substance Use, Sexual Risk and Violence among Inner City Youth through

"Adolescent and parent stress and support related to adolescent gender identity. Project Summary/Abstract We know little about how transgender adolescents and their parents perceive and experience transgender adolescents' gender identity development, minority stress, and the parent-adolescent stress and support factors related to adolescent psychological functioning (i.e. psychological distress, self-image). Transgender adolescents face minority stressors related to discrimination, stigma and inadequate social support received as they navigate their transgender identity development across multiple social environments. Additionally, parent- adolescent stress (hereafter referred to as dyadic stress) and parent-support processes can contribute to psychological functioning for all adolescents, and particularly for transgender adolescents navigating their gender identity development during adolescence. The proposed mixed-method study will use a dyadic approach to explore transgender adolescent and parent perspectives of adolescent minority stress and adolescent-parent stress and support processes and assess correlations with adolescent psychological functioning. To harness the full potential of dyadic data collection, the perspectives of transgender adolescents and their parents will be captured independently and simultaneously using a Life History Calendar qualitative interview approach and quantitative survey of parent support and adolescent psychological functioning. Specifically, this study aims to: (1) describe gender minority adolescents' stressors and parental support from both the adolescent and parent perspectives and identify dyadic stressors experienced by adolescent and parent; (2) identify specific areas of overlap and discordance between adolescent and parent regarding stress and support related to adolescent gender identity and expression; and (3) assess the relationships of minority stress, dyadic stress, parental support and adolescents' psychological functioning. Evidence from the present pilot study will contribute to future studies by: (1) using minority and parent- adolescent support and stress constructs to inform a theoretical model specific to transgender adolescents and their parents; (2) providing evidence to understand benefits of involving parents within transgender specific research and behavioral health interventions; (3) identifying how social justice oriented policy can promote well-being for transgender adolescents and families. Project Narrative  Transgender adolescents are disproportionately impacted by mental health concerns including depression, anxiety, and poor self-esteem and body image. Research has focused on either the experiences of transgender youth or their parents, but not both, which limits our understanding of transgender adolescent – parent stress (i.e., dyadic stress) and parent support. Specifically, this pilot study uses Life History Calendar (LHC) informed qualitative interviews and a quantitative behavioral health and parent-support survey to investigate transgender adolescent and parent perceptions of adolescent minority stress, adolescent-parent stress and parent support in response to adolescent gender identity development and expression and assesses potential correlations with adolescent psychological functioning.",Adolescent and parent stress and support related to adolescent gender identity.,9470728,F31HD091981,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Body Image ', ' body perception ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Surveys ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Self Concept ', ' self esteem ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Justice ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Area ', ' Encapsulated ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' self knowledge ', ' self awareness ', ' Self view ', ' Self image ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self Perception ', ' Inequality ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' System ', ' emotional adjustment ', ' emotional style ', ' emotional adaptation ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' life history ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' parent-child communication ', ' psychological distress ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Data ', ' Calendar ', ' Process ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' neglect ', ' family management ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' behavioral health intervention ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' gender minority ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' cisgender ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2018,36176,0.08045136743683153
"Improving the Reproductive Health of Families Adolescents in Botswana face extraordinary reproductive health challenges. Teen pregnancy forces girls to leave school after which few resume their education. Botswana has the second highest HIV prevalence in the world, with incidence increasing rapidly at ages 15-19, peaking at 40.2% prevalence by ages 30-34. STIs are prevalent despite the availability of free health care. Traditional sex education, provided in now banned village initiation schools, is no longer available and parents are uncomfortable discussing reproductive health within the family. In an earlier R34 award, guided by a Community Advisory Board and Adolescent Advisory Group, we conducted formative interviews, assessed the psychometric adequacy of the proposed measures, and adapted and assessed the feasibility and acceptability of interventions for youth and their parents. We now propose to conduct a 3-arm randomized controlled trial with 500 families, ½ with a male and ½ with a female adolescent age 13-18. Arm 1 (N = 200) will receive the parent intervention “Families Matter 2!” (FM2!) and their adolescent will participate in “Living as a Safer Teen” (LAST). In Arm 2 (N = 200), parents receive FM2! Only and six months later their adolescents will receive LAST allowing us to assess the impact of the parent program alone and potential boost in outcomes when adolescents are also engaged in intervention. Arm 3 (N = 100), the comparison arm, will be the current, widely-delivered program in Botswana. Each adolescent and parent dyad will complete ACASI assessments in English or Setswana at baseline, post-intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-ups on family communication, parenting practices, knowledge of sexual development, and sexual behavior. Youth will also complete psychosocial measures assessing attitudes toward condoms, perceived barriers to sexual safety, attitudes toward transactional sex, acceptance of gender violence, and self-efficacy. Gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will be tested at baseline and 12-month follow-up for adolescents. A pilot trial affirmed the feasibility of recruiting parent(caretaker)/adolescent dyads and retention exceeded 95% for both parents and adolescents. While the pilot trial was underpowered, results suggest that the interventions improved family communication, child management skills, knowledge of sexual development, attitudes toward contraception; lowered tolerance for intergenerational transactional sex and gender violence; and lowered sexual risk behavior of both parents and adolescents in the intervention arm. In addition, youths who were abstinent upon entering the pilot intervention appear to have delayed sexual debut more successfully than the comparison arm. This study addresses the highest priority in Botswana’s current national strategic plan. If the results provide strong evidence of effectiveness, the Ministries of Education, Health, Youth & Culture, National AIDS Coordinating Agency, and the Office of the President have committed to its dissemination throughout Botswana. This application proposes to deliver and evaluate a pilot-tested multi-level reproductive health intervention for Batswana adolescents and their parents. The study will evaluate interventions designed to improve reproductive health outcomes for adolescents and their families that are designed to have high public health impact. Program impact will be evaluated with cognitive, behavioral, biomedical and cost effectiveness endpoints from baseline across the following year and the results have broad applicability throughout

"Enhanced Intervention to Improve Adolescent Outcomes: A Clinical Trial ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited access to care is a major contributor to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and unintended pregnancy for U.S. adolescents and contributes to significant health disparities, including rates of STIs that are 6-7 times higher for uninsured youths than for insured youths. Racial/ethnic disparities also exist, with African American and Hispanic adolescents evidencing    pregnancy rates that are 4 times higher than White youths. The emergency department (ED) represents an important but underutilized location for reaching large numbers of sexually at-risk adolescents with limited access to evidence-based care and there is growing support for use of the ED to improve adolescent sexual health outcomes. Because few proven interventions are available in the ED to motivate youth to safer sexual behavior and provide health services (e.g., STI testing, condoms), novel interventions are needed. Dr. Miller, a pediatric emergency medicine physician and the candidate for this Career Development Award, is committed    to conducting patient-oriented behavioral research to improve adolescent health outcomes, focusing on underserved communities. Together with a strong multi-disciplinary mentorship team, Dr. Miller has created a four-year career development plan which includes structured mentoring, completion of a Master of Science in Clinical Research, and focused training in the use of health behavior change theories to develop multi-level interventions, research methods and statistical analyses for behavioral intervention trials, effective counseling strategies for health behavior change, health care system and payment models, and responsible conduct of    research. Dr. Miller's training activities will be complemented by an innovative project that will facilitate practical application of these new skills. The goal of the project is to enhance and tes a previously piloted ED SexHealth intervention that uses a dedicated health educator to provide risk reduction counseling, point-of care health services, and referral for ongoing care. Following intervention refinement, Dr. Miller will conduct a randomized trial of the enhanced intervention versus a standard information arm to determine the effect size of rates of health service uptake and enhanced intervention feasibility. We hypothesize that the intervention will result in higher health service uptake and increased condom use versus a standard information arm. The    rationale is that it will produce the first controlled data on an intervention designed to improve adolescent sexual health outcomes using a novel and effective method of delivering care. We expect to use these critical effect size estimates to inform the design of a larger clinical trial o evaluate efficacy. Dr. Miller's training efforts will culminate in the submission of an R01 proposa to fund this trial. This training and research plan are consistent with the mission of the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Healthy People 2020 objectives from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and the 2009 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and unintended pregnancy are costly public health problems that disproportionately affect adolescents, particularly those with limited access to care. Emergency department-based sexual health interventions have potential to reach large    numbers of high-risk youth, but effective interventions are lacking. Our plan to develop a novel intervention is consistent with the mission of the National Institutes of Health as well as with th Healthy People 2020 objectives and has these public health implications: 1) increased access to sexual health services and counseling for underserved youth, 2) decreased time interval to treatment for youth with STIs and HIV, and 3) reduced risk for STI, HIV, and

"Preventing Alcohol and Other Drug Use and Violence among Latino Youth Preventing Alcohol and Other Drug Use and Violence among Latino Youth Project Summary/Abstract This K01 research and training award advances my long-term goal of developing interventions designed to target alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and violence among Latino adolescents in the United States. Adolescent AOD use and violence are profoundly interrelated as evidence clearly indicates that adolescent AOD users are more likely to enact violence and that both acute intoxication and chronic use are related to aggression. Moreover, results from prospective studies suggest that youth involvement in violence also predicts subsequent AOD use. Latino early adolescents (ages 11 to 14) are disproportionally at risk to use alcohol and take part in violent behavior. And yet, there remains a critical need for the development of readily-scalable, preventative interven- tions that target AOD use and violence among Latino youth. The proposed research plan focuses on adapting an empirically-supported AOD use intervention (keepin' it REAL [kiR]) to include a focus on violence and, in turn, testing the adapted preventative intervention to examine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects. The proposed multidisciplinary training plan is designed to assist me in developing the necessary skills to effectively function as an independent researcher and carry out high-impact translational research. Specifically, this will include training in the use of qualitative methods to inform the adaptation and development of interventions, the process of systematically adapting/developing interventions, and, finally, the testing of interventions and preven- tion outcomes research. My training plan is directly linked to the three study aims. In Aim 1, I will conduct focus group interviews designed to inform the adaptation of kiR to include a focus on violence prevention. In Aim 2, I will build upon this formative research by adapting kiR to incorporate a focus on youth violence and violence prevention. And, in Aim 3, I will lead a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which the adapted intervention is tested in order to assess the feasibility/acceptability of the adapted intervention and assess whether a signal of efficacy is present for AOD use and violence outcomes. The contribution of the proposed research is expected to be the development of a readily-scalable, multicomponent preventative intervention for AOD use and violence among Latino early adolescents that can be tested in a fully-powered RCT (R01). This study addresses a signif- icant gap in prevention science among a large and rapidly-growing minority group experiencing multiple, inter- related health disparities. Moreover, this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide me with the training, research experience, and preliminary data necessary to make the leap to independent investi- gator status. Such experience and training is foundational in my effort to build upon my prior research in ways that can translate into intervention research projects designed to yield real-world benefits. Preventing Alcohol and Other Drug Use and Violence among Latino Youth Project Narrative: Public Health Relevancy Latinos are disproportionally at risk to use alcohol and other drugs (AOD) and take part in violent behavior during the critical stage of early adolescence (ages 11 to 14). And yet, there remains a need for the development of readily-scalable, prevention programs designed to target both AOD use and violence among this large and rap- idly-growing population.

"Preventing Suicide in African American Adolescents Abstract The aim of this grant application is to test the effectiveness of a culturally-adapted, school- based suicide prevention intervention, delivered by indigenous Rush University social workers (i.e., “intervention social workers”), for low-resourced, urban, African American 9th grade students. Rates of suicide among African American youth have increased substantially in the past 20 years, and suicide is currently one of the leading causes of death among African American adolescents. As such, there is a need for effective, sustainable prevention interventions for these populations. Our study will train intervention social workers to deliver a culturally-adapted, evidence-based coping with stress prevention intervention (i.e., the Adolescent Coping with Stress Course [A-CWS]). Urban African American adolescents who have participated in the A-CWS have demonstrated decreases in suicide risk, as well as decreases in anxiety and increases in several dimensions of adaptive coping (i.e., use of positive coping strategies for problem experiences, positive thinking, depression coping self- efficacy). We aim to demonstrate that indigenous intervention social workers can implement the A-CWS with fidelity and that participants in intervention groups facilitated by indigenous intervention social workers experience increases in levels of adaptive coping. We will examine the extent that interpersonal factors (i.e., thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness) and socio-ecological factors (i.e., community violence exposure, limited neighborhood resources, family dynamics) influence active suicidal ideation. We will test whether these factors influence active suicidal ideation in African American adolescents. Lastly, our study will examine the mechanism by which the A-CWS intervention reduces suicide risk for low-resourced, urban African American adolescents. We will examine the ability of adaptive coping skills, gained through participation in the A-CWS intervention, increase hope and reduce hopelessness. We will then examine the moderating effects of hope and hopelessness on the influence of interpersonal and socio-ecological factors on active suicidal ideation. This translational study has public health implications. It will expand the understanding of mechanisms of change related to suicide risk reduction in urban African American adolescents. It will test a modified version of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide for urban African American adolescents. Lastly, our study will inform the training and monitoring of indigenous mental health professionals to deliver evidence-based prevention interventions for urban African American adolescents; as such, our study will inform the practice of prevention intervention sustainability and dissemination. To examine the effectiveness of an evidence-based and culturally-grounded stress-reduction intervention (i.e., the A-CWS), facilitated by indigenous social workers, to increase adaptive coping and reduce active suicidal ideation in African American 9th graders. This study has broad public health implications and informs procedures for scaling up efficacious, high quality, and culturally grounded suicide prevention programs and best practices for the prevention of suicide among African American adolescents.",Preventing Suicide in African American Adolescents,9807076,R01MH118382,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Cause of Death ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Chicago ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' family structure/dynamics ', ' Family dynamics ', ' Female ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Health ', ' male ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Social Workers ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Dimensions ', ' interest ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' ninth grade ', ' high school freshman ', ' 9th grade ', ' Prevention ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Indigenous ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Study Section ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' suicide rate ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' Minority ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' coping ', ' translational study ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' reducing suicide ', ' reducing suicidality ', ' reduce suicide ', ' reduce suicidality ', ' service providers ', ' service delivery ', ' stress reduction ', ' violence exposure ', ' exposure to violence ', ' ']",NIMH,DE PAUL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,1235922,0.0883128655556045

"Speaking Their Language: Using Social Media and Texting to Create an Adolescent-Centered Approach to Healthy Weight Gain During Pregnancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tammy Chang, MD, MPH, MS is a family physician and junior clinical investigator focused on reducing obesity among adolescent mothers and their children. Dr. Chang's long-term career objective is to reduce health disparities among low-income adolescent mothers using tailored eHealth technologies. The objective of this K23 mentored career development award includes a 5-year plan for training and research activities that will provide the skills and experiences needed to become a successful independent investigator. RESEARCH CONTEXT: The United States (US) has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the developed world; the majority of pregnant adolescents gain excess weight during pregnancy. Excess pregnancy weight gain has a significant negative impact on the health of the adolescent mother, increases the risk of dangerous complications during delivery, and contributes to long-term obesity for both mother and child. In recognition of this important population health problem, both the IOM and AHRQ have identified the development of interventions targeting excess pregnancy weight gain as a major research priority. Compared to adults, relatively little is known about pregnancy weight gain among adolescents. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand adolescents' perceptions of and knowledge about pregnancy weight gain, so that researchers can customize interventions and make them relevant to the pregnant adolescent. The short-term goal of this proposal is to acquire the requisite skills to develop an adolescent-centered tailored eHealth intervention to reduce excess pregnancy weight gain. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Determine which US pregnant adolescents (aged ≤21 years) are at high risk for significant excess pregnancy weight gain; 2) Identify the baselin knowledge, beliefs, and factors that influence excess pregnancy weight gain among adolescents; and 3) Design and test a scalable healthy diet and exercise eHealth intervention tailored to at-risk pregnant adolescents. RESEARCH PLAN: To accomplish these aims, Dr. Chang will conduct analyses using nationally representative data from the Fragile Families and Wellbeing Study; carry out social media mining and corresponding qualitative interviews with pregnant and postpartum adolescents; and design, implement, and evaluate an adolescent- centered and tailored eHealth (tailored text-messaging) intervention. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Chang will broaden her knowledge of advanced statistical methods using a large nationally representative dataset; develop skills in mining and analyzing online social media data; acquire expertise in designing, implementing, and evaluating scalable interventions tailored to pregnant adolescents; and obtain experience in translating research findings into clinically relevant policies and practices. Dr. Chang's career development goals will be supported through close mentorship from an interdisciplinary team; guidance from an expert advisory panel; advanced didactic course work; attendance at professional meetings and workshops; participation in seminars and journal clubs; guidance in manuscript preparation and grant proposal development for projects arising from the research she conducts as part of this proposal; and implementing her research plan. This training will directly contribute to Dr. Chang's goal of addressing a vital intergenerational problem of excess pregnancy weight gain among at-risk adolescents, as well as the subsequent submission of a successful R01 application. ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Chang's unique resources include a dedicated and accomplished multi-disciplinary mentorship team with whom she has previously collaborated; the outstanding research infrastructure at the University of Michigan and Department of Family Medicine with a particular emphasis on supporting junior investigators; and numerous advanced didactic courses and seminars provided by several distinct academic units at the University of Michigan. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The US has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the developed world, and most pregnant adolescents in the US gain excess weight during pregnancy. Excess weight gain during pregnancy not only has a significant negative impact on the health of the adolescent mother, it increases the risk of dangerous complications during delivery, and contributes to long- term obesity for both mother and child. The overarching goal of this proposal is to promote healthy weight gain among pregnant adolescents by leveraging technologies adolescents use frequently, including online social media and

"Early adolescents living in adversity: a global mixed methods study The goal of the proposed fellowship is to prepare the applicant, Shoshanna Fine, for a career in applied psychosocial health research applicable to global and domestic populations, with a specific focus on investigating and improving mental well-being among vulnerable youth living in contexts of adversity. To this end, the applicant proposes to investigate psychosocial risks among early adolescents (10-14 years) living in low-resource urban settings across low-, middle-, and high-income countries. The applicant will carry out the proposed research alongside individualized mentorship, didactic training, and professional development opportunities targeted towards the following training objectives: 1) develop expertise in psychosocial health among vulnerable youth living in contexts of adversity, with a focus on the biological, psychological, and social factors that relate to youth development; 2) attain proficiency in applying mixed methods approaches that integrate advanced statistical techniques (including latent variable modeling) with in-depth qualitative analysis; and 3) strengthen skills in grant writing and effective dissemination of scientific findings to academic and nonacademic audiences, domestically and internationally. These objectives will help propel the applicant towards an independent and productive research career. The proposed research is of high  public health relevance. Adolescence is a critical developmental period, with the social-emotional skills and health-related behaviors that emerge during this time serving as a foundation for future well-being. While the majority of the world’s adolescents live in contexts of adversity, many of which can be found in low- and middle-income countries, only a fraction of the research on adolescent psychosocial development has been conducted in these settings. Successful prevention strategies targeting youth living in contexts of adversity require an understanding of the co-occurring emotional and behavioral risks that signify underlying psychosocial vulnerability, as well as the social environments that exacerbate and buffer these risks. Further, there is a need for studies across low-, middle-, and high-income countries to assess the contextual generalizability of key factors in adolescent psychosocial development. Finally, mixed methods approaches can enrich such investigations by providing a more comprehensive exploration of psychosocial risks in adolescence than would be obtainable from relying solely on one set of methods. To fill these gaps, the proposed research will use data from the multi-country Global Early Adolescent Study to: 1) characterize typologies of psychosocial risks among early adolescents, and explore whether these typologies vary by gender and urban setting; 2) assess associations between these typologies and key social environmental risk and protective factors; and 3) qualitatively explore the meanings that adolescents in one urban setting ascribe to risk behaviors based on membership in different typologies. The proposed research aligns with the NICHD’s priority to study psychosocial adjustment for individuals in high-risk environments.",Early adolescents living in adversity: a global mixed methods study,9833858,F31HD100161,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Behavior ', ' Belgium ', ' Buffers ', ' Mainland China ', ' China ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Ecuador ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Netherlands East Indies ', ' Malay Archipelago ', ' East Indies ', ' Indonesia ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Nyasaland ', ' Malawi ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' United States ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Writing ', ' Zaire ', ' Belgian Congo ', ' Democratic Republic of the Congo ', ' Gender ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Nature ', ' Individual Adjustment ', ' Victimization ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' peer ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' psychosocial development ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Subgroup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' peer victimization ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' migration ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' psychosocial adjustment ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' urban setting ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,45016,0.116191993507757
"Enhanced Intervention to Improve Adolescent Outcomes: A Clinical Trial ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited access to care is a major contributor to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and unintended pregnancy for U.S. adolescents and contributes to significant health disparities, including rates of STIs that are 6-7 times higher for uninsured youths than for insured youths. Racial/ethnic disparities also exist, with African American and Hispanic adolescents evidencing    pregnancy rates that are 4 times higher than White youths. The emergency department (ED) represents an important but underutilized location for reaching large numbers of sexually at-risk adolescents with limited access to evidence-based care and there is growing support for use of the ED to improve adolescent sexual health outcomes. Because few proven interventions are available in the ED to motivate youth to safer sexual behavior and provide health services (e.g., STI testing, condoms), novel interventions are needed. Dr. Miller, a pediatric emergency medicine physician and the candidate for this Career Development Award, is committed    to conducting patient-oriented behavioral research to improve adolescent health outcomes, focusing on underserved communities. Together with a strong multi-disciplinary mentorship team, Dr. Miller has created a four-year career development plan which includes structured mentoring, completion of a Master of Science in Clinical Research, and focused training in the use of health behavior change theories to develop multi-level interventions, research methods and statistical analyses for behavioral intervention trials, effective counseling strategies for health behavior change, health care system and payment models, and responsible conduct of    research. Dr. Miller's training activities will be complemented by an innovative project that will facilitate practical application of these new skills. The goal of the project is to enhance and tes a previously piloted ED SexHealth intervention that uses a dedicated health educator to provide risk reduction counseling, point-of care health services, and referral for ongoing care. Following intervention refinement, Dr. Miller will conduct a randomized trial of the enhanced intervention versus a standard information arm to determine the effect size of rates of health service uptake and enhanced intervention feasibility. We hypothesize that the intervention will result in higher health service uptake and increased condom use versus a standard information arm. The    rationale is that it will produce the first controlled data on an intervention designed to improve adolescent sexual health outcomes using a novel and effective method of delivering care. We expect to use these critical effect size estimates to inform the design of a larger clinical trial o evaluate efficacy. Dr. Miller's training efforts will culminate in the submission of an R01 proposa to fund this trial. This training and research plan are consistent with the mission of the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Healthy People 2020 objectives from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and the 2009 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and unintended pregnancy are costly public health problems that disproportionately affect adolescents, particularly those with limited access to care. Emergency department-based sexual health interventions have potential to reach large    numbers of high-risk youth, but effective interventions are lacking. Our plan to develop a novel intervention is consistent with the mission of the National Institutes of Health as well as with th Healthy People 2020 objectives and has these public health implications: 1) increased access to sexual health services and counseling for underserved youth, 2) decreased time interval to treatment for youth with STIs and HIV, and 3) reduced risk for STI, HIV, and

"Adolescent and parent stress and support related to adolescent gender identity. Project Summary/Abstract We know little about how transgender adolescents and their parents perceive and experience transgender adolescents' gender identity development, minority stress, and the parent-adolescent stress and support factors related to adolescent psychological functioning (i.e. psychological distress, self-image). Transgender adolescents face minority stressors related to discrimination, stigma and inadequate social support received as they navigate their transgender identity development across multiple social environments. Additionally, parent- adolescent stress (hereafter referred to as dyadic stress) and parent-support processes can contribute to psychological functioning for all adolescents, and particularly for transgender adolescents navigating their gender identity development during adolescence. The proposed mixed-method study will use a dyadic approach to explore transgender adolescent and parent perspectives of adolescent minority stress and adolescent-parent stress and support processes and assess correlations with adolescent psychological functioning. To harness the full potential of dyadic data collection, the perspectives of transgender adolescents and their parents will be captured independently and simultaneously using a Life History Calendar qualitative interview approach and quantitative survey of parent support and adolescent psychological functioning. Specifically, this study aims to: (1) describe gender minority adolescents' stressors and parental support from both the adolescent and parent perspectives and identify dyadic stressors experienced by adolescent and parent; (2) identify specific areas of overlap and discordance between adolescent and parent regarding stress and support related to adolescent gender identity and expression; and (3) assess the relationships of minority stress, dyadic stress, parental support and adolescents' psychological functioning. Evidence from the present pilot study will contribute to future studies by: (1) using minority and parent- adolescent support and stress constructs to inform a theoretical model specific to transgender adolescents and their parents; (2) providing evidence to understand benefits of involving parents within transgender specific research and behavioral health interventions; (3) identifying how social justice oriented policy can promote well-being for transgender adolescents and families. Project Narrative  Transgender adolescents are disproportionately impacted by mental health concerns including depression, anxiety, and poor self-esteem and body image. Research has focused on either the experiences of transgender youth or their parents, but not both, which limits our understanding of transgender adolescent – parent stress (i.e., dyadic stress) and parent support. Specifically, this pilot study uses Life History Calendar (LHC) informed qualitative interviews and a quantitative behavioral health and parent-support survey to investigate transgender adolescent and parent perceptions of adolescent minority stress, adolescent-parent stress and parent support in response to adolescent gender identity development and expression and assesses potential correlations with adolescent psychological functioning.",Adolescent and parent stress and support related to adolescent gender identity.,9707594,F31HD091981,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Body Image ', ' body perception ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Self Concept ', ' self esteem ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Justice ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Friends ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Area ', ' Encapsulated ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Self Perception ', ' self knowledge ', ' self awareness ', ' Self view ', ' Self image ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Inequality ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' System ', ' emotional adjustment ', ' emotional style ', ' emotional adaptation ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' life history ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' parent-child communication ', ' psychological distress ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Data ', ' Calendar ', ' Process ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neglect ', ' family management ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' behavioral health intervention ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' LGB ', ' gender minority ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' cisgender ', ' cis-gender ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' gender expression ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2019,37148,0.08045136743683153
"Individually tailored physical activity intervention for Latina adolescents: Ninas Saludables Abstract Latina adolescents report low levels of physical activity, with only 3% meeting national physical activity guidelines, and are at high lifetime risk for conditions related to inactivity, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Interventions grounded in sound psychosocial theory and leveraging growing technology use in Latina adolescents are needed to reverse patterns of inactivity, establish healthy lifetime habits and reduce widening disparities. Our research team has developed and tested individually tailored web-based interventions to increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), which significantly increased MVPA in Latina adults. In our recent pilot study (R03NR014329), we adapted this intervention based on formative interviews to make it appropriate for Latina adolescents and tested it in a single-arm pilot trial (N=21). After 12 weeks, retention was high (90.5%) and self-reported MVPA increased from 24.7(26.11) minutes/week at baseline to 79.4(46.8) at follow up (p<0.001), suggesting good potential efficacy. In closeout interviews, girls expressed a preference to increase audio-video components of the website and to incorporate other mobile- health technologies, such as texting, smartphone apps, social networks, and wearables. Thus, the aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=200) of an individually tailored, theory-based, multi- technology intervention to increase MVPA in Latina adolescents. The 12-month intervention will comprise a counseling session to teach behavior change techniques, an interactive multimedia website with individually tailored content, a wearable tracker and smartphone app to reinforce behavior change techniques, connection to an Instagram account reinforcing web content, and automated text messages to guide continued goal setting. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention or only a wearable tracker. Activity will be measured at baseline, six-months (primary outcome) and 12 months using well-established MVPA measures (accelerometers and the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Interview). We hypothesize that those randomized to receive the intervention will show significantly greater increases in MVPA at six months than those in the control group. We will also evaluate whether changes in MVPA are mediated by changes in targeted psychosocial constructs (e.g. self-efficacy, social support), and whether intervention effects are moderated by baseline personal and environmental variables (e.g. age, BMI, neighborhood environment). Costs to deliver the intervention (e.g. staff time, materials, overhead) will be tracked to evaluate costs and cost- effectiveness of both study arms, and we will evaluate the effects of contact time out outcomes. We will also explore trajectories of daily activity in both the intervention and control groups using continuous data from wearable trackers. The proposed study will promote a critical preventive health behavior, physical activity, in Latina adolescents using technologies that are pervasive in this high risk population and highly scalable, laying the groundwork for cost-effective, broad reaching interventions with great potential for public health impact. Project Narrative: Latina adolescents report high rates of inactivity and are at especially high lifetime risk for diabetes, obesity, and other lifestyle-related conditions. The proposed study seeks to promote physical activity among this at-risk, understudied population by conducting a randomized controlled trial of an individually tailored, theory-based multi-technology physical activity intervention. The proposed high reach, low cost strategy for increasing physical activity has great potential for adoption on a larger scale and thereby for positively impacting public health, reducing risk of chronic disease and eliminating health disparities in this quickly growing, high risk population.",Individually tailored physical activity intervention for Latina adolescents: Ninas

"Preventing Alcohol and Other Drug Use and Violence among Latino Youth Preventing Alcohol and Other Drug Use and Violence among Latino Youth Project Summary/Abstract This K01 research and training award advances my long-term goal of developing interventions designed to target alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and violence among Latino adolescents in the United States. Adolescent AOD use and violence are profoundly interrelated as evidence clearly indicates that adolescent AOD users are more likely to enact violence and that both acute intoxication and chronic use are related to aggression. Moreover, results from prospective studies suggest that youth involvement in violence also predicts subsequent AOD use. Latino early adolescents (ages 11 to 14) are disproportionally at risk to use alcohol and take part in violent behavior. And yet, there remains a critical need for the development of readily-scalable, preventative interven- tions that target AOD use and violence among Latino youth. The proposed research plan focuses on adapting an empirically-supported AOD use intervention (keepin' it REAL [kiR]) to include a focus on violence and, in turn, testing the adapted preventative intervention to examine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects. The proposed multidisciplinary training plan is designed to assist me in developing the necessary skills to effectively function as an independent researcher and carry out high-impact translational research. Specifically, this will include training in the use of qualitative methods to inform the adaptation and development of interventions, the process of systematically adapting/developing interventions, and, finally, the testing of interventions and preven- tion outcomes research. My training plan is directly linked to the three study aims. In Aim 1, I will conduct focus group interviews designed to inform the adaptation of kiR to include a focus on violence prevention. In Aim 2, I will build upon this formative research by adapting kiR to incorporate a focus on youth violence and violence prevention. And, in Aim 3, I will lead a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which the adapted intervention is tested in order to assess the feasibility/acceptability of the adapted intervention and assess whether a signal of efficacy is present for AOD use and violence outcomes. The contribution of the proposed research is expected to be the development of a readily-scalable, multicomponent preventative intervention for AOD use and violence among Latino early adolescents that can be tested in a fully-powered RCT (R01). This study addresses a signif- icant gap in prevention science among a large and rapidly-growing minority group experiencing multiple, inter- related health disparities. Moreover, this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide me with the training, research experience, and preliminary data necessary to make the leap to independent investi- gator status. Such experience and training is foundational in my effort to build upon my prior research in ways that can translate into intervention research projects designed to yield real-world benefits.

"Early Intervention for Suicide Risk among Immigrant Youth PROJECT SUMMARY Background. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-24 year olds in the United States, yet there is a dearth of evidence-based prevention programs that explicitly address suicide risk factors prior to the onset of suicide attempts. First and second generation immigrant youth comprise 25% of the U.S. population under 18 and experience specific risk factors for suicidal ideation and attempts. This includes family conflict exacerbated by differing cultural expectations between parents and children and disruptions to parent-child communication. At the same time, family-based preventive interventions focused on enhancing family protective factors show promise for reducing later suicide risk. Research Strategy. The present study focuses on developing and testing a family-based preventive intervention for suicide risk through three interrelated projects. These are: 1) Conducting longitudinal analyses of two existing datasets to identify how social support assets (e.g., experiences of family, peer, and community support) buffer suicide risk for adolescents at high risk of suicidal behavior, and examining how these associations may vary by gender and racial/ethnic group; 2) Utilizing intervention mapping and qualitative data to develop and refine a new preventive intervention, the Early Intervention for Suicide Risk among Immigrant Youth; and 3) Pilot testing the early intervention with first and second generation immigrant Latino/a adolescents screening positive for suicide risk and their families. 40 families will be randomized to the intervention or to usual care. Feasibility, acceptability, and impact on the intervention targets will be assessed. Training Plan. In coordination with the research plan, Dr. Alvarez will pursue training in the following three areas: 1) methodological approaches relevant to development and evaluation of preventive interventions targeting low base rate behaviors; 2) innovative approaches to assessment of suicide risk in clinical research contexts; and 3) design and testing of prevention programs delivered in healthcare, school, and community settings, with a particular focus on suicide prevention. Her research will be based at the Disparities Research Unit in Massachusetts General Hospital, a Harvard Medical School affiliated, major medical center providing access to an abundance of clinical research resources and training opportunities. Mentorship. The project’s mentorship team provides a range of complementary expertise relevant to the research and training aims of this proposal. Dr. Alvarez’s primary mentor, Dr. Alegria, is an expert in health disparities and health services research with extensive experience in mentoring early career investigators, including K awardees. Her co-mentor Dr. Wyman provides expertise in youth suicide prevention and prevention research, and co-mentor Dr. Shrout provides expertise in statistical modeling of longitudinal data and analysis of clinical trial outcomes. A team of advisors provides additional expertise in the epidemiology of depression and suicidal behaviors (Dr. Roberts), adaptive testing for mental health assessment (Dr. Gibbons), family-based preventive intervention design and evaluation (Dr. Pantin), and clinical trials for depression and related disorders (Dr. Alpert). Candidate. Dr. Alvarez is an early career researcher trained in school and child clinical psychology who is completing NIMH-funded postdoctoral training in health disparities and mental health services research focused on culturally diverse populations. This K23 project would provide the foundation to launch her career as a clinical researcher specializing in suicide prevention, with a particular focus on interventions addressing the needs of immigrant youth and on family-based preventive interventions delivered in healthcare and community settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among adolescents, with rates increasing between 1999 and 2014. Family-based preventive interventions demonstrate promise for reducing suicide risk among adolescents, and are particularly relevant for addressing suicide risk factors specific to immigrant youth, who comprise one-fourth of the U.S. population under 18. The development of an effective preventive intervention for the immigrant youth population would make critical contributions to the reduction of suicide rates nationwide.",Early Intervention for

"Dating Violence and Sexual Risk Prevention for Young Mothers DATING VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL RISK PREVENTION FOR YOUNG MOTHERS Adolescent mothers (ages 15-19) are at greater risk than non-parenting peers for dating violence (DV) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, increasing teen mothers’ and their children’s risk for negative health outcomes. Evidence-based interventions to reduce both DV and sexual risk in young mothers’ relationships are limited. Adolescent mothers are disproportionately from low-income, racial and ethnic minority backgrounds, and thus face additional barriers to accessing prevention interventions. The proposed project includes 3 aims: 1) identifying and testing ways to increase recruitment and engagement of adolescent mothers (ages 15-19) from underserved backgrounds in DV and sexual risk prevention research at hospital- based clinics; 2) adapting Date SMART, an evidence-informed DV and sexual risk prevention intervention, for adolescent mothers; and 3) conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention, Date SMART-Young Moms (YM) in an ambulatory clinic setting at Cooper University Hospital in Camden, NJ. Camden is a city where the majority of residents are low-income, racial and/or ethnic minorities, and teen birth rate is among the highest in the state. In Phase 1, key informant interviews with 10 healthcare providers and focus groups with 16 young mothers will help identify where, when, and how to best connect with the target population in hospital-based outpatient clinics. In Phase 2, recruitment methods will be tested by recruiting two more focus groups of 16 adolescent mothers to inform the adaptation of Date SMART, a 7-session, group- based intervention designed for at-risk, underserved adolescent girls. Date SMART aims to reduce DV and sexual risk behavior by teaching cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based skills to reduce depressive symptoms, emotional reactivity, and interpersonal skills deficits. Focus group feedback will be used to adapt Date SMART for young mothers (Date SMART-YM). Phase 3 will be a randomized controlled trial of Date SMART-YM with 32 adolescent mothers (16 in the intervention condition, 16 in the control condition) in a hospital clinic setting, and a pilot test of the Date SMART-YM assessment battery. Primary outcomes are changes from baseline to post-intervention in sexual risk behavior (condom use at last sex, number of unprotected sex acts) and DV (perpetration and victimization of hostile, coercive, and violent behaviors). Secondary outcomes include feasibility (recruitment and retention rates) and acceptability (qualitative and quantitative intervention feedback). Undergraduate research assistants will play an active role in recruitment, intervention adaptation, and delivery, and will receive mentoring from experts in sexual risk and DV prevention, health disparities, and qualitative and quantitative research methods. Results will inform a future fully-powered efficacy trial comparing Date SMART to a health promotion control condition. Delivering CBT skills to reduce depressive symptoms, emotional reactivity, and interpersonal skills deficits in healthcare settings will ultimately decrease sexual risk behavior and DV, and improve the health of adolescent mothers and their children. Project Narrative Adolescent mothers from underserved backgrounds are at high risk for negative health outcomes associated with dating violence and sexually transmitted infections, which also affect the health of their children. The proposed project will use qualitative and quantitative methods to improve research recruitment and engagement strategies for adolescent mothers, adapt a dating violence and sexual risk prevention intervention for this population, and test the adapted intervention in a pilot randomized controlled trial with adolescent mothers in an outpatient hospital clinic setting.",Dating Violence and Sexual

"Predicting Suicide Risk in Sexual Minority and Nonminority Youth: Associations Among Neural Sensitivity to Social Rejection, Peer Rejection, and Suicidality ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a need for research that can help better predict risk and prevent suicide among adolescent youth. Rates of suicidality, a strong predictor of suicide, are higher among adolescent girls compared to boys, and highest among sexual minority girls (girls who endorse same-sex romantic attraction, behavior or identity). This study tests an innovative model of suicide risk in a sample of sexual minority and nonminority adolescent girls that integrates neurobehavioral and interpersonal vulnerabilities. Specifically, the model posits that neural sensitivity to social rejection, when occurring in the presence of peer rejection, increases risk for suicide. This proposed K01 bridges the candidate's prior training in interpersonal risk for depression and developmental psychopathology, with new training in affective neuroscience and suicide risk. This training will uniquely position the candidate to investigate the development of negative valence systems, with an emphasis on affective sensitivity to social rejection, and associations with suicidality. Thus, the proposed study will be the first in a larger program of research that will contribute to NIMH research priorities, such as Strategic Objective 2, by investigating how individual differences in biologic and social/environmental factors contribute to heterogeneity in the development of suicide risk in diverse populations. Specifically, the candidate plans to follow the proposed study with larger longitudinal studies using multiple methods and repeated assessments of neurobehavioral and interpersonal vulnerability for suicide during the adolescent developmental period to examine 1) how pain related neural circuitry underlying affective sensitivity to social rejection may be associated with suicide risk, and 2) interpersonal factors (e.g., interpersonal rejection) that may contribute to and strengthen sensitivity to social rejection over time within the context of social and pubertal changes in adolescence. The candidate will also be positioned to investigate etiological models explaining elevated suicide risk among sexual minority youth. This program of research is expected to advance the field by improving the ability to predict risk for suicide among vulnerable youth, and to identify targets for intervention during optimal developmental windows.  To achieve these career objectives, the candidate will receive training in developmental affective neuroscience, neuroimaging methods, and theory and research on development of suicide risk in adolescence, including sexual minority youth. She has an ideal mentorship team within an optimal scientific training environment to provide the requisite training for her to meet her career goals. Dr. Jennifer Silk is an expert on development of social-emotional processing from childhood into adolescence. Dr. Mary Phillips has significant expertise in affective neuroscience and fMRI methods, and neural underpinnings of emotional reactivity and regulation. Dr. Michael Marshal provides expertise on suicidality disparities between sexual minority and nonminority youth. Additional mentorship and support from consultants will provide training in the role of pain neural circuitry underlying the affective experience of social rejection (i.e. ""social pain"", Dr. Naomi Eisenberger), and the development of suicide risk in adolescents (Dr. David Brent) and new methods to assess suicide risk (Dr. Matt Nock). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents in the U.S., and suicide rates increase markedly during the transition from childhood to adolescence. The study will be the first in a larger program of research designed to investigate how the RDoC domain for negative valence systems is linked to suicide by investigating how aspects of the physical pain system involved in affective responses to social rejection and loss may influence risk for suicide, and how exposure to rejection experiences may amplify risk for suicide among vulnerable youth. Knowledge gained from this research will inform 1) what interventions should be used for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, such as the potential use of neuromodulatory interventions currently used to treat physical pain conditions, 2) who is in need of these interventions, such as youth with heightened affective sensitivity to social rejection, and 3) when to use these interventions, such as after social rejection experiences during the adolescent developmental period.","Predicting Suicide Risk in Sexual Minority and Nonminority Youth: Associations Among Neural Sensitivity to Social Rejection, Peer Rejection, and Suicidality",9691498,K01MH109850,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Interview ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Social Development ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' somesthetic sensory cortex ', ' Somatosensory Cortex ', ' Stress ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Silk ', ' Friends ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' career ', ' Friendships ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' Marshal ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' social separation ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' emotional distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' High Prevalence ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' peer victimization ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' suicide model ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' neural model ', ' Affective ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' sexual minority ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Negative Valence ', ' Same-sex ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2019,159879,0.00619708328218947
"Feasibility of a multi-level school intervention for LGBTQ youth ABSTRACT The goal of this proposed R21 grant is to test the feasibility of a theoretically informed, school-based intervention for LGBT adolescents (Proud & Empowered; P&E). LGBT adolescents experience disparities in behavioral health outcomes compared to their heterosexual peers. For example, LGBT adolescents are 3 to 4 times more likely to meet criteria for an internalizing disorder and 2 to 5 times more likely to meet criteria for externalizing disorders than their heterosexual counterparts. This is commonly attributed to minority stressors, including victimization in schools, that is associated with poor school climate. Our intervention seeks to address these disparate behavioral health problems through use of a novel multi-level school-based prevention intervention. Our goal will be achieved by completing two specific aims: 1) Assess the feasibility (i.e., recruitment, enrollment, fidelity of service delivery, satisfaction, safety, and retention) and participant-level efficacy of the intervention in a delayed intervention RCT with four schools. 2) Obtain preliminary estimates of school-wide intervention effects on (a) reporting of minority stress and behavioral health outcomes among all LGBT students and (b) changing climate (norms, attitudes, beliefs, bullying behaviors toward LGBT youth) among all students. We expect that (H1) LGBT students in schools where the P&E intervention is delivered will report fewer minority stress experiences and fewer behavioral health symptoms as compared to LGBT students in control schools, even if they did not participate in the 10-week P&E intervention themselves; and (H2) students in schools where the P&E intervention is delivered will report improvements in school climate toward LGBT students as compared to students in control schools. This innovative R21 application brings together a team of nationally recognized minority stress and prevention science experts and responds to a nationally established public health need for research from the National Academy of Medicine, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have proposed to test a minority stress-informed, developmentally appropriate intervention for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) adolescents and their schools. If successful, this project will provide direction for a larger randomized control trial on the effectiveness of this intervention, and participation will address the behavioral health concerns found in this vulnerable population.",Feasibility of a multi-level school intervention for LGBTQ youth,9726162,R21MD013971,"['Academy ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Students ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Administrator ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' Source ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' physical assault ', ' physical attack ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Drops ', ' Ally ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Teenagers ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' peer victimization ', ' Minority ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' control trial ', ' intervention effect ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' school district ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' recruit ', ' service delivery ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer ', ' LGBTQ ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2019,258723,0.03513061794475742
"Hormones, Immunity and HIV Risk ABSTRACT Our over arching goal of this application is to determine if exogenous progestins used in long acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) will enhance adolescent risk for mucosal HIV acquisition. In the U.S., persons aged 13-24 years accounted for 26% of all new HIV infections. The HIV epidemic in adolescent girls reflects the strong combined impact of gender and income inequality, early sexual debut, age disparate sexual relationships, psychosexual maturation, sociocultural context, and heightened biological vulnerability. Exogenous progestins, expecially medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), have been epidemiologically linked to greater HIV acquisition. Gaps remain in our understanding of biological factors that might be associated with increased risk of HIV acqusition in adolescent girls and how exogenous progestins will influence this risk. LARCs use is encouraged for all women desiring to not become pregnant as they release progestins over 3 to 5 years. Typical LARCs include etonogestrel implants (ENG-I) or levonorgestrel-intrauterine system (LNG- IUS). Our preliminary data shows cervical tissue collected from women using MPA and LNG-IUS for contraception replicates HIV 2- to 3.5-fold higher than cervical tissue from non-contracepting women. Therefore, our aims center on potential genital tract differences non-contracepting and contracepting (ENG-I and LNG-IUS) 120 adolescents (18 to 19 years old) and correlate our findings to non-contracepting and contracepting 90 adult women (≥25 years old). First, differences in the capcity of cerivcal tissue to replicate HIV will be assess between the groups and associated with resident cell populations. Secondly, the vaginal fluid and epithelium, which provide the first line of defense against pathogens, including HIV, will be systematically studied. Vaginal fluid will be characterized for the microflora and the soluble mucosal proteins using an unbiased proteomic approach. These results will be correlated to functional activity of the luminal fluid as measured by in vitro anti-HIV activity. Our premise is that non-contracepting adolescent women will demonstrate higher levels of mediators and activated immune cells that are associated with increased HIV infection compared to more mature women. However, contracepting adolescent and adult women will have comparable levels of the mediators, activated immune cells, and capacity of tissue to replicate HIV. A key challenge will be the recruitment of adolescent girls. Our advantage is that adolescents frequent the outpatient clinic at Magee Womens Hospital and our clinical team has worked with adolescents in other studies, which overcomes many of the recruitment challenges. We have close working relationships among the groups represented in this application and have optimized specimen handling/processing/testing which is key for reproducibility in our work. This application will uniquely associate quantified analyses with functional outcomes and begin to address if exogenous progestins impose additional risk of HIV acquisition to young women. NARRATIVE Young women make up 20% of incident HIV infections in the U.S. and long acting reversible contraception is provided to reduce pregnancies. We lack information on biological factors in young girls that make them susceptible to HIV infection and if the contraception provided increases their risk in acquiring HIV. This application will help fill this gap by determining if the contraceptive hormones negatively modify those biological factors with the goal of improving the health of next generation.","Hormones,

"The Impact of Stress and Resilience on Obesity-related Metabolic Complications in Adolescents PROJECT SUMMARY Rates of obesity are high in adolescents, with these youth at greater risk for developing metabolic complications than their lean peers. Poor metabolic function is associated with worse health outcomes, higher health care costs, and other health comorbidities; however, not all youth with obesity develop metabolic complications. Black youth have fewer metabolic complications compared to White youth, despite having among the highest rates of obesity. Understanding unique protective factors that slow the progression to poor metabolic health is necessary for reducing adverse health outcomes and improving the quality of life of adolescents with obesity. Thus, the specific aims of the proposed research are: 1) to examine differences in weight- and race-based stigma between Black adolescents who have obesity without metabolic complications (OMC-) and matched Black adolescents who have obesity with at least 2 metabolic complications (OMC2+); 2) to evaluate differences in physiological stress and psychological stress between OMC- and OMC2+ adolescents; and 3) to explore differences in resilience between OMC- and OMC2+ adolescents. We will use a case-control cross-sectional design to conduct 100 interviewer-administered surveys with caregivers and Black adolescents with and without metabolic complications in the US Midsouth. We will examine two groups of Black youth (aged 11-17) with obesity (defined as having a waist circumference ≥90th percentile). The OMC- group will include 50 adolescents with obesity who have optimal levels of blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, and liver function. The OMC2+ group will include 50 adolescents with obesity who have two or more metabolic complications (i.e., high blood pressure, elevated triglycerides, low high density lipoprotein (HDL), insulin resistance, and/or impaired liver function) matched to OMC- youth by age and sex. Quantitative surveys will examine caregiver and youth reports of weight- and race-based stigma, psychological stress, and resilience. Physiological stress will be assessed via salivary cortisol (diurnal and awakening response). We will obtain data on metabolic function including: blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and liver function. Given known associations with study outcome variables, we will obtain measures of income, physical/mental health, and dietary intake, and as well as measures of physical activity and sleep patterns via actigraphy. This innovative study will contribute to the field's understanding of why some Black youth are not yet exhibiting metabolic complications while others are. While genetic factors may account for ~27% of these variations, biopsychosocial factors have been underexplored. Thus, by studying this rare group of OMC- adolescents, we will obtain data on mutable factors that are relevant to a community most impacted by obesity. Knowledge gained will serve as pilot data for an R01 grant to develop a strength-based, culturally-informed intervention aimed at decreasing health disparities and maintaining metabolic health among Black youth with obesity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past 30 years, soaring rates of adolescent obesity have become a major public health concern, with many, but not all, of these youth developing metabolic complications. By studying risk and resilience among Black adolescents who have obesity without metabolic complications, we will understand why some youth are able to maintain this lower risk state; thus providing knowledge about modifiable factors that could alter the progression to poor metabolic health. We aim to study differences in physiological stress, psychological stress, weight-based stigma, race-based stigma, and resilience between Black youth with and Black youth without obesity-related metabolic complications; with findings poised to inform the development of strength-based interventions for reducing health disparities and promoting metabolic health among adolescents.",The Impact of Stress and Resilience on Obesity-related Metabolic Complications in Adolescents,9988137,R21DK113344,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exhibits ', ' hepatic steatosis ', ' Liver Steatosis ', ' Fatty Liver ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' increased triglycerides ', ' high triglycerides ', ' elevated triglyceride ', ' elevated tg ', ' Raised triglycerides ', ' Raised TG ', ' Hyperglyceridemia ', ' Hypertriglyceridemia ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Interviewer ', ' alpha-Lipoproteins ', ' High density lipoprotein ', ' Heavy Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Lipoproteins ', ' HDL ', ' High Density Lipoproteins ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Sleep ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Leanness ', ' Thinness ', ' Time ', ' Triacylglycerol ', ' Triglycerides ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Physical activity ', ' liver function ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' impaired glucose tolerance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Body fat ', ' Knowledge ', ' Salivary ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' waist circumference ', ' psychosocial ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' case control ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' liver inflammation ', ' Analysis of Covariance ', ' ANCOVA ', ' metabolic rate ', ' adolescent health ', ' Adolescent obesity ', ' youth adiposity ', ' obesity in adolescents ', ' obesity in adolescence ', ' obesity during adolescence ', ' obesity among adolescents ', ' obese adolescents ', ' protective factors ', ' sleep pattern ', ' ']",NIDDK,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,187012,0.06499806260439236
"Emergence of Implicit Bias during Adolescent Development 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed research investigates how implicit racial bias develops and can be counteracted among racial majority adolescents. Racial majority adults’ implicit bias toward lower-status racial groups perpetuates societal inequalities in health (e.g., via subpar medical care), wealth (e.g., via biased hiring), and well-being (e.g., via discriminatory social interactions). Developmental research identifies adolescence as a critical time to address implicit racial bias before it becomes entrenched in adulthood. The broader goals of this project are to elucidate the social-cognitive processes underlying majority adolescents’ implicit racial bias and to design interventions to counteract this bias. These goals align with NICHD’s priority to understand social and cognitive factors related to the development of (biased) reasoning. While implicit bias has negative consequences for minority groups, such bias may also decrease racial majority adolescents’ intergroup contact and relationships, which are critical for developing social-cognitive skills (e.g., cognitive flexibility) that facilitate adaptive adjustment in a multicultural society. The central hypotheses of this study are: (1) adolescents with more exposure to African Americans will have greater social-cognitive skills to individuate (i.e., perceive them as unique individuals) and humanize them (i.e., attribute human mental states), and in turn will develop less implicit racial bias, and (2) directly teaching adolescents to individuate and humanize African American people will reduce implicit bias. The specific aims are: (1) to examine how peers and media influence adolescents’ implicit racial bias through the development of the tendency to individuate and humanize African American people, and (2) to conduct an intervention integrating individuation and humanization interventions to reduce adolescents’ implicit bias in the long-term. Regarding methods, Aim 1 will be a yearlong, three-wave correlational study examining longitudinal links between racial majority adolescents’ a) exposure to African Americans, b) individuation and humanization of African American people, and c) implicit racial bias. Aim 2 will be a 2x2 intervention study (Individuation [yes, no] x Humanization [yes, no]) in which participants will read first-person narratives from African American adolescents and view corresponding photographs; the intervention conditions will vary in whether they promote individuation (by training subjects to differentiate the target African American adolescents) and humanization (e.g., by including emotional stories in the narratives). The study will assess implicit bias 3 months later to examine long-term effects. This project is theoretically and methodologically innovative and is expected to be significant because it will advance the development of empirically-validated strategies to reduce societal racial inequalities. The accompanying three-year postdoctoral training plan will take place predominantly in the psychology department at the University of California, San Diego. The trainee will be provided mentorship from leading psychologists in implicit racial bias research, training in state-of-the-art theoretical and methodological approaches, and a formal postdoctoral training program to launch her independent academic career. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Research indicates that implicit racial bias contributes to societal inequalities in health, wealth, and well-being, yet little is known about how to reduce implicit bias for the long-term. Improving scientific knowledge of how to mitigate implicit bias is critical for attaining a more equitable society that promotes the health of all its citizens. The proposed project investigates how implicit racial bias develops and can be mitigated during adolescence— a developmental period when racial attitudes are highly responsive to social influence and intervention.",Emergence of Implicit Bias during Adolescent Development,9759338,F32HD098777,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Individuation ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Prejudice ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Punishment ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Societies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconscious State ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' mental state ', ' mental status ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Emotional ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Address ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' NICHD ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' Advanced Development ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' critical period ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive skill ', ' implicit bias ', ' racial bias ', ' race bias ', ' intervention cost ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F32,2019,60854,0.07286726554805285
"Identifying Environmental Factors Promoting HIV/STI Risk in Black Adolescents and Young Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect Black adolescents and young adults in the United States. Environmental or structural factors such as discrimination, crime, and poverty have been proposed as potential drivers of persistent racial disparities. Though HIV and STI incidence tend to be geospatially clustered, the specific environmental predictors of clustering among Black adolescents and young adults are not well understood. Exploratory mapping using geographic information systems (GIS) has revealed that HIV and STI incidence in adolescents and young adults is higher in certain neighborhoods in Massachusetts, the setting of the proposed project. Determining the associations between specific environmental factors in neighborhoods and HIV/STI incidence in Black adolescents and young adults is important for intervention planning. Candidate: My career goal is to become an independent investigator focused on developing structural interventions for HIV/STI prevention in underserved communities. As a physician trained in Infectious Diseases, I am fully committed to overcoming persistent health disparities noted among people at risk for and living with HIV and STIs. To become an independent investigator, I require additional research training and mentorship, building on the clinical, publc health, and implementation science training that I have previously received. Research Proposal: The primary objective of this proposal is to determine the relationships between neighborhood-level environmental factors and HIV/STI incidence in Black adolescents and young adults. The proposed study has three AIMs: (1) to qualitatively explore the impact that environmental factors have on HIV and STI risk behavior by conducting focus groups with Black adolescents and young adults from higher and lower HIV/STI incidence neighborhoods; (2) to quantitatively determine the association between selected environmental factors and HIV/STI incidence using geospatial analysis; and (3) to use a mixed- methods participatory approach to identify interventions to address environmental factors associated with HIV/STIs using data gathered in AIMs 1 and 2. Training: The research plan will be supported by courses in qualitative, quantitative, and geospatial analyses, clinical trial design and utilization of large scale socio-behavioral and demographic data sets for secondary analyses. Mentorship and Resources: My mentorship team will be co-led by Dr. Kenneth Mayer, Infectious Disease Specialist and expert in HIV/STI prevention and Dr. Laura Bogart, social psychologist with expertise in disparities in HIV, adolescent health, and qualitative and quantitative methods. To achieve my goals, I will avail myself of the resources available within the Division of Global Health Equity at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Fenway Institute of Fenway Health (www.thefenwayinstitute.org), and the Harvard Center for AIDS Research. I will also benefit from a team of dedicated advisors in geospatial analysis, behavioral health and adolescent sexual health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect Black adolescents and young adults. Environmental or structural factors - practices, policies, institutional and contextual forces that are external to and outsideof an individual's control - may promote or protect against HIV/STI acquisition and contribute to persistent racial disparities. Discrimination, crime, poverty and community beliefs about homosexuality are environmental factors that may be associated with HIV and STI risk in Black adolescents and young adults. Both HIV/STI incidence and these environmental factors tend to be clustered geographically. However, the specific environmental predictors of HIV/STI clustering among Black adolescents and young adults are not well understood. This research seeks to understand the relationships between neighborhood-level environmental factors and HIV/STI incidence in Black adolescents and young adults. Determining the associations between specific environmental factors and HIV/STI risk and incidence is important for focused intervention planning in this vulnerable population.",Identifying Environmental Factors Promoting HIV/STI Risk in Black Adolescents and Young Adults,9676373,K23MH107316,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Anger ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Belief ', ' Boston ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Crime ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Homosexuality ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Massachusetts ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Review Literature ', ' Exposure to ', ' Victimization ', ' American ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' psychological distress ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobia ', ' Homophobic ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' adolescent health ', ' adolescent sexual health ', ' juvenile sexual health ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' STI prevention ', ' sexually transmitted infection prevention ', ' sexually transmitted disease prevention ', ' prevent sexually transmitted infections ', ' prevent sexually transmitted disease ', ' STD prevention ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2019,180582,0.0910183484452519
"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments.

"Cardiometabolic Health in Adolescents of South Asian Ancestry - the CHAriSmA study Project Summary/Abstract South Asians (SA), the fastest growing major ethnic group in the U.S., are also at greater type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk at relatively lower body mass index (BMI) compared to those of European and African ancestry. The mechanism(s) underlying this increased cardiometabolic risk remain undefined. We are submitting this research proposal in response to an NIH program announcement (PA-17-021) requesting proposals addressing health disparities in NIDDK diseases. The increased cardiometabolic risk in SA Americans represent an understudied and disparate risk. Mostly adult, associative studies performed outside the U.S. indicate that SA have higher % body fat, visceral adiposity, and abdominal adiposity for a given BMI than other ethnic groups. These studies have also found increased insulin resistance and dyslipidemia as well as decreased insulin-mediated glucose disposal (inversely proportional to visceral fat) and β-cell function in SA adults. We propose to study SA adolescents, in order to elucidate early mechanistic changes underlying their increased cardiometabolic risk. Given the unique fat distribution of SA, we propose to define ectopic fat deposition and test for altered fat metabolism and β-cell insulin secretion in SA adolescents in the U.S. We will use cutting-edge, innovative techniques, including MRI/MRS, mathematical modeling of free fatty acid (FFA) kinetics, and the glucose-potentiated arginine test (GPA) to measure insulin secretory capacity, methods not previously used in SA adolescents. We have assembled a highly experienced, multi-institutional (CNMC, CHOP, NIH), and multi-disciplinary team with a track record of successful collaboration, to perform a cross-sectional study of 12-21 year old adolescents and young adults of SA ancestry (n=50), BMI ≥ 85%ile, compared to adolescents of European ancestry (White) (n=50) and African American (AA) ancestry (n=50) of comparable age, sex, and BMI %ile. AA individuals are known to also have increased cardiometabolic risk but have decreased visceral adiposity, making them a unique comparison group. Aims: 1. To examine ancestry-related differences in body fat distribution (by MRI/MRS), FFA flux (by 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test and Minimal Model of fatty acid kinetics), and to compare the relationships between visceral adiposity and FFA flux among ancestral groups. 2. To examine ancestry-related differences in β-cell insulin secretory capacity (by GPA), and compare the relationship between FFA flux and insulin secretory capacity among groups. 3. To compare CVD and T2DM risk factors and vascular end organ injury (aortic pulse wave velocity) among the three groups, and test for ancestry-related differences in the relationships between FFA flux and cardiometabolic risk profile. Exploratory Aim: to compare adipocyte-derived exosomal microRNAs involved in insulin signaling among the groups, and measure their association with β-cell insulin secretory capacity, for hypothesis generation. Thus, this proposal will investigate whether associations between ectopic fat, FFA flux, and β-cell secretion vary by ancestry to impact cardiometabolic risk, with the expectation that this may eventually lead to ancestry-specific treatment options. PROJECT NARRATIVE South Asians (SA) (those with ancestral roots in India, Pakistan, the Maldives, Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka) are the fastest growing major ethnic group in the U.S., nearly doubling in numbers between 2000 and 2013. SA also have increased type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk at relatively lower body mass index compared to other ethnicities, but the mechanism(s) underlying this increased risk are not known. This study will investigate the possible connections between altered body fat distribution, fatty acid metabolism, and insulin secretion in SA compared to those of African American and European ancestries, to look for differences which in the future, may have implications for ancestry-specific treatments of disease.",Cardiometabolic Health in Adolescents of South Asian Ancestry -

"Sex and Race/Ethnicity-specific Multilevel Factors Influencing Pubertal Trajectories: a Population-based Study ABSTRACT Age of pubertal onset has declined dramatically in both girls and boys in the US, with substantial racial/ethnic disparities. This has important public health implications as early puberty is linked with a variety of detrimental adolescent behavioral and emotional outcomes as well as adult chronic diseases. In response to these trends, clinicians have adjusted by shifting the guidelines for the cutoff point for early puberty from age <8 to as early as age <6 in girls. To design effective interventions, we must first: (1) establish current normative trajectories for US adolescents by sex, race/ethnicity and BMI to reliably identify children who are going through puberty substantially earlier than their peers of the same racial/ethnic group, and (2) identify sex-specific modifiable risk factors that can serve as targets for intervention strategies in high-risk groups. Healthy People 2020 emphasizes the importance of improving adolescent health because puberty is an important window of susceptibility that impacts adolescent behaviors and adult morbidity. To address the lack of data on pubertal trajectories by racial/ethnic groups, described in PA-18-033, we will take advantage of the robust data for the racially/ethnically diverse population of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) to conduct the largest population-based, longitudinal study undertaken to date. Acknowledging the importance of screening for early puberty, KPNC began routine documentation of pediatrician-assessed Tanner stages in the electronic health record (EHR) in 2010, and we have since validated the quality of these data. We will use these pubertal development data, race/ethnicity, and pre-pubertal BMI data to efficiently characterize the sex- and race/ethnicity specific normative distributions of pubertal onset and tempo (rate of pubertal progression from onset to completion of maturation) in 170,000 boys and girls (Aim 1). We will then use data on a sub-cohort of boys and girls who were born at KPNC after the implementation of the EHR system (2006) to create a virtual birth cohort to investigate individual-level early life intervenable metabolic factors such as maternal pre- pregnancy obesity, gestational weight gain, and postnatal growth trajectory (Aim 2) as factors influencing pubertal timing. Lastly, we will link historical geocoded address data to the California Neighborhood Data System, which we developed, to investigate contextual factors (e.g., social and built environment) influencing pubertal timing (Aim 3). Our studies incorporate several innovations and strengths including the use of large and comprehensive EHR and a diverse population of boys and girls to conduct an otherwise costly longitudinal study, examination of several important hallmarks of puberty, and investigation of individual and contextual level factors as risk factors. Risk factors identified from this study and the role of sex and race/ethnicity will guide the design of upstream individual- as well as policy-level interventions. Such interventions targeting high risk groups will advance our long-term goal of preventing health disparities worsened by early puberty. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Early puberty has been found to increase the risk of depression and behavioral difficulties during adolescence, and of several chronic diseases in adulthood. Despite the observed trend toward earlier pubertal development in US adolescents, little is known about current normative pubertal timing among minorities or boys, nor modifiable risk factors that may influence timing of puberty, aside from childhood obesity. We will characterize normative distributions of pubertal timing in a large representative population so that clinicians can reliably identify children developing substantially earlier than their peers (Aim 1), and further, identify individual-level and neighborhood level factors that influence pubertal timing to inform the design of targeted strategies to prevent early puberty (Aims 2&3), with a long-term goal of reducing adolescent and adult risks of serious chronic diseases.",Sex and Race/Ethnicity-specific Multilevel Factors Influencing Pubertal Trajectories: a Population-based Study,9714536,R01HD098220,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescent Behavior ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Literature ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Sharing the burden of discrimination: Parents as sources of resilience from adolescent obesity-related health risk Abstract Research Project: African American (AA) and Hispanic/Latina (HL) female adolescents show markedly elevated rates of obesity compared to their Non-Hispanic White (NHW) and male peers. Minority and female youth also experience increased discrimination-related stress; stress-induced alterations to physiology and behavior may partially account for these disparities in obesity prevalence. Guided by attachment theory, an influential paradigm that has never before been applied to the study of obesity-related health disparities, this project takes a resilience-focused approach, proposing that parents can buffer the impact of discrimination on youth. When parents serve as a safe haven (SH), providing comfort when youth face threat, and a secure base (SB), encouraging youth to actively cope with stressors in the environment, they help to strengthen youth’s ability to withstand discrimination with less physiological wear and tear. Attachment theory proposes that SH/SB can be measured both behaviorally and physiologically, as SH/SB exchanges affect both parent and youth Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity. Participants include 120 female adolescents (1/3 AA, 1/3 HL, 1/3 NHW; 1/3 obese, 1/3 overweight, 1/3 typical weight) and their caregivers, enrolled in an R01 study of adolescent stress and obesity-related health parameters (body composition, physiology, energy balance, and cardio-metabolic markers). Attachment relationships are measured during parent-youth discussions of youth experiences of discrimination. Both parent SH/SB behavior and parent-youth ANS activity linkage are assessed as indices of attachment. The study’s first aim tests whether associations between youth discrimination and obesity-related health are moderated by a) coded SH/SB or b) parent-youth ANS linkage. The second aim identifies catalysts of this health-protective parenting (SH/SB and physiology) for parents who have been exposed to discrimination. Parents’ history of discrimination may either reduce or enhance their sensitive responses to youth’s experiences of discrimination, depending on the parent’s capacity for reflective functioning, the ability to attune to youth’s thoughts, emotions, and intentions. The proposed study adds parent-youth discrimination discussions to an existing, data-rich study of adolescent obesity disparities. By identifying attachment relationships as reducing the obesogenic effect of discrimination, this project lays the foundation for the future development of dyadic obesity interventions for at-risk minority youth. Training Plan and Environment: Post-doctoral training will launch PI Kazmierski’s research career as a clinical psychologist who studies social determinants of health for at-risk youth. Via research, coursework, mentorship, and professional development activities, the proposed fellowship will endow Ms. Kazmierski with increased mastery of the theories, methodologies, and statistical approaches used in health disparities research. Working with Drs. Rao, Borelli, and their collaborators at UC Irvine provides a resource- and mentorship-rich environment to scaffold Ms. Kazmierski’s academic and professional development. Project Narrative Public Health Relevance: Ethnic/racial disparities in adolescent obesity portend cascades of health risk throughout the lifespan, putting AA and HL women at increased risk for heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. The proposed study takes a resilience-focused approach, proposing that parent-youth attachment relationships buffer the obesogenic effects of discrimination.

"Social Network Analysis of Puberty, Activity Behaviors, and Health Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular and metabolic diseases are among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the US. There are also substantial disparities in cardiometabolic health depending upon racial/ethnic background and sex that can be traced back to adolescence, the developmental period when youth begin to choose their own social environments and start to make decisions that impact their current and future health. While adolescent physical activity (PA), screen time (ST), and sleep duration are known modifiable behavioral determinants of cardiometabolic health, pubertal timing can also shape an adolescent's activity behaviors, directly through their own behavioral choices, but also indirectly through the behavioral choices of their friends. Therefore, a reduction in disparities in cardiometabolic risk between population subgroups may be achieved by identifying the early social, biological, and behavioral pathways that shape later-life health. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the largest, most comprehensive longitudinal survey of adolescents ever undertaken, is an ideal dataset to test hypotheses about how adolescent social relationships and biological factors may interact to shape health as youth transition into adulthood. In the proposed research, we will use state-of-the-art statistical social network models that allow us to evaluate how the simultaneously changing structure of social relationships, changing friend activity behaviors, and pubertal timing within one's friendship group jointly shape adolescent activity behaviors as well as later-life cardiometabolic risk. An especially innovative aspect of this research is that we can use objectively-measured biomarker data in young adulthood to study the interaction of adolescent social network, biological, and behavioral precursors on later cardiometabolic health. Young adulthood represents an age when chronic illnesses begin to emerge, and when pre-disease pathways (indicated by objectively-measured hypertension, high sensitive C-reactive protein, cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin, and overweight/obesity) can be assessed to gain insight into the mechanisms by which social experiences influence future disease onset. With rich information on the contextual factors that shape human development and health, we can thus evaluate hypotheses regarding the joint importance of pubertal maturation, activity trajectories, and friends' pubertal maturation and activity trajectories on these markers of young adult cardiometabolic health. This proposal is responsive to PA-14-176 as research to identify: (1) social and biological mechanisms that promote positive sustainable health behaviors in children and youth, (2) contextual influences on lifelong health behaviors, and (3) sources of racial/ethnic and gender disparities in risk. Results from these secondary analyses in a nationally representative sample of 132 schools will allow us to adjudicate competing explanations for how adolescent social conditions are linked to adult health, identifying optimal network targets for a future intervention to reduce health disparities before the onset of chronic disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Activity behaviors change dramatically across adolescence, as youth experience the overt physical changes of puberty and begin to make decisions about their social settings that will impact their current and future health. In general, physical activity levels decline (especially in girls and racial/ethnic minority populations), screen time spent with televisions, video games, and computing devices increases, and sleep is truncated. Further investigation is needed to evaluate pathways through which adolescent activity behaviors, relationship environments, and pubertal development may interact to shape later cardiometabolic risks and racial/ethnic risk disparities; this will inform the design of new interventions that leverage social ties to interrupt the development of pre-disease pathways during the life course.","Social Network Analysis of Puberty, Activity Behaviors, and Health Disparities",9688252,R21NR017154,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Buffers ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cholesterol ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Decision Making ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Glycated Hemoglobins ', ' Glycosylated Hemoglobin ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Joints ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Puberty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Television ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Games ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Friendships ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Shapes ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' behavior change ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' Health and Behavior in Children ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Interruption ', ' Subgroup ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' tv watching ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' social regression ', ' adjudicate ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' peer influence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' network models ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' pubertal timing ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' adolescent health ', ' gender disparity ', ' secondary analysis ', ' adequate sleep ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' sleep pattern ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R21,2019,239565,0.12852739331377502
"Health and Psychosocial Need: The Ascenze study of risk and protection in adolescence South Africa (SA) has the largest HIV epidemic globally, and is simultaneously affected by poverty, inequality, violence and other legacies of Apartheid. Children growing up in disadvantaged communities affected by HIV are at high risk for cognitive, behavioral, health and educational problems that, in turn, increase their risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV. This study has the long-term goal of halting the devastation of the HIV epidemic by intervening to promote better cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial functioning of adolescents in SA. We will use a socio-ecological model with a life course perspective to prospectively investigate factors linked to drug use, binge drinking and unprotected sex including adolescent attributes such as executive function, and past and current family and contextual factors.  The population-based Asenze cohort of 4-6 year old children and their primary caregiver, funded through R01 DA023697, will form the study sample. They reside in five disadvantaged areas in KwaZulu-Natal. The children, born between 2004 and 2006, were previously assessed at two time points on cognitive, bio- medical, and psychosocial functioning and their caregivers were interviewed about caregiver HIV, mental health, substance use, stress, support, household assets and household substance use. Over 25% of caregivers were HIV+; 9% reported binge drinking, 31% screened positive for a psychiatric disorder, over 30% had experienced partner violence and 17% reported that someone in the household had a drinking problem. Only 9% of households contained an adult who had completed secondary school.  The Asenze cohort, reaching adolescence between 2017-2019, provides a unique opportunity to investigate the early-life origins of adolescent risk behavior in a disadvantaged population while building a strong foundation for later investigations into adulthood. We will investigate the pathways through which adolescent executive function and impulsivity, interact with both early and current social context (including their family adversity, disorganization and support as well as the behavior of their friends) affect the initiation of risky behaviors (drug use, binge drinking and unprotected sex). We will link the childhood cohort assessments of development and early adversity to those to be collected in both early and mid adolescence, including cognitive development, executive function and the initiation of risky behaviors. The findings will be crucial for informing critical prevention programs to halt the spread of HIV and promote healthy adolescent functioning.  We will build research capacity through mentoring and training emerging South African scientists, masters, doctoral and post-doctoral students to build research expertise focused on investigating the impact of adolescent neurocognitive development on the initiation of risky behaviors, which result in negative education and sexual health outcomes, including HIV infection. We will also develop a SA research network of investigators working with cohort studies to promote their use in neuroscience and mental health outcomes.   Leslie Davidson and Chris Desmond, co-PIs Narrative: Health and Psychosocial Need: Being submitted to Fogarty in response to PAR 14-332 The Asenze study of adolescent risk and protection will investigate how early and current family and social strengths and difficulties impact the adoption by South African teenagers of risky behaviors (drug use, binge drinking, unprotected sex), behaviors that will sharply increase their chances of HIV infection and other negative outcomes such as school failure or adolescent pregnancy. We will measure their ability to think things through, to plan and to resist impulses, abilities that will affect whether or not they engage in risky behaviors. Because we will follow-up 1581 children whom we have already assessed twice in childhood, we know a great deal about them, their childhood experiences and family life and this information will be extremely useful in developing interventions to prevent harmful behaviors and to protect adolescents from becoming part of an ongoing HIV epidemic.",Health and Psychosocial Need: The Ascenze study of

"A culturally centered CBT protocol for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among Latinx youth Project Summary The overall goal of this research program is to provide effective culturally relevant care to Latin families, and address the NIMHD mission of reducing disparities in underserved and minority populations. Evidence-based and culturally centered treatments for Latinx teens (Latinx = gender inclusive term) with suicidal ideation and attempts (SIA) and their families are quite limited. Emerging evidence indicate that Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a promising treatment approach in reducing suicidal ideation and attempts in Non-Latinx White adolescents. However, culturally adapted treatments have been shown to benefit Latin families more that non-culturally adapted treatments. This study is innovative in its use of a culturally centered CBT treatment protocol (Socio-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Suicidal Behavior-SCBT-SB) to address the specific needs of Latinx teens and their families. The SCBT-SB addresses central issues in adolescent identity formation (e.g. ethnicity, sexual orientation), family interactions and communication, and parenting skills. The SCBT-SB was developed with Latinx youth with SIA in Puerto Rico and further modified for Latin families in the US. Feasibility of this modified version of the SCBT-SB was tested in the US by conducting a pilot RCT (n=46) of SCBT vs treatment-as-usual (TAU) with positive results. It was found that SCBT-SB was feasible to implement in a community mental health center with frontline therapists, acceptable to families, and showed reductions in suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms. The scientific premise of the proposed study is that immigration and acculturation (the process of assimilation to the host culture) and enculturation (maintaining cultural values and costumes) experiences have an impact on SIA in Latinx teens; and that personalization of an evidence- based treatment, according to cultural and immigration experiences, will result in better treatment outcomes than TAU. This application proposes a hybrid efficacy/effectiveness trial with 160 suicidal Latinx teens randomly assigned, following baseline assessment, to 2 treatment conditions, TAU and SCBT-SB. Follow-up assessment will take place at 3, 6 and 12 months after baseline. All treatment will take place at a community mental health clinic. The specific aims are: 1) To test the effect of the SCBT-SB versus TAU on suicidal ideation in a clinical sample of adolescents under conditions of strong external validity, and 2) To test the effect of the SCBT-SB versus TAU on depressive symptoms, given its high correlation with SIA. Exploratory aims are: 3) To examine the effect of SCBT-SB versus TAU on suicide attempts, and 4) To examine potential mediators (family environment) of treatment outcome. Successful completion of this study will positively impact treatment of Latinx immigrant adolescents at high risk of SIA in the US. Project Narrative The primary aim of the proposed research is to test the effect of a culturally centered treatment protocol, the Socio-cognitive behavioral therapy (SCBT), versus Treatment as Usual on suicidal thoughts and attempts, and depressive symptoms, in a clinical sample of Latinx adolescents. The study is trying to determine, if we take into account perspectives of Latin immigrant families and minority youth, whether better outcomes can be found for this high risk group.",A culturally centered CBT protocol for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among Latinx youth,9835265,R01MD013907,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' CMHC ', ' Community Mental Health Centers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Immigration ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mission ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Assimilations ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Spirituality ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Immigrant ', ' programs ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Disease remission ', ' Remission ', ' preference ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Proxy ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Teenagers ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' treatment center ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' suicidal adolescent ', ' suicidal youth ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' family support ', ' underserved minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMMA PENDLETON BRADLEY HOSPITAL,R01,2019,509489,0.06865564877269503
"Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to Reach Vulnerable Young Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Vulnerable female adolescents in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town who use alcohol and other drugs (AOD) and have dropped out of school experience the greatest burden of new HIV infections in South Africa. The risk for acquiring HIV is perpetuated through intersecting factors of AOD use, gender inequality, sexual risk, victimization, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence. Despite the pervasive ongoing transmission of HIV, this vulnerable population remains underserved by current HIV and drug treatment programs, with few providing HIV testing and counselling (HTC), antenatal care, or substance abuse rehabilitation, and none providing comprehensive HTC programs that address these intersecting risks for HIV among this population. Since 2001, we have adapted and conducted a comprehensive evidence-based intervention for women, the Women's Health CoOp (WHC), that addresses AOD use, sexual risk, and gender-based violence. The WHC was listed in the USAID Compendium of Gender Studies in Africa. The Young Women's CoOp (YWC) is an adaptation of the WHC that targets this vulnerable population of AOD using female adolescents. This proposed RFA project seeks to reach this hard-to-reach population and overcome barriers to improved health for female adolescents who have dropped out of school by increasing update of HTC through a comprehensive gender-focused HTC intervention with trained peer co-facilitators and outreach workers from each community. The study findings may provide knowledge that could be used to increase the uptake of services and improve treatment adherence among female adolescents through the use of peer-driven intervention methods. Specific Aims: Our specific aims including the following. In a cluster randomized trial conducted in 12 disadvantaged communities in Cape Town, South Africa, and with government collaboration, we propose: Aim 1. To train and evaluate adolescent peer role models to conduct community outreach with established outreach workers to recruit 500 out-of schools, substance-using female adolescents aged 15-19 for HTC, and to co-facilitate a gender-focused comprehensive HTC program. Aim 2. To test the efficacy of a young women's gender-focused comprehensive HTC program for reducing substance use, victimization, and sexual risk behavior (primary outcomes) and improving access to effective treatment and support services through linkages to care (substance abuse treatment, HIV, STIs, antenatal and reproductive health as secondary outcomes) relative to standard HTC for adolescent females. This study's collaboration with the Western Cape-Department of Social Development and the City of Cape Town will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention within community centers will most likely ensure greater sustainability where it is needed most. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact for the proposed study is tri-fold and described as follows. First, reaching 500 adolescent females in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town with its high rates of school dropout (and often consequent unemployment), substance use, gender inequality, sexual risk, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence is essential for HTC and risk reduction, as these intersecting risk factors appear to be antecedents to the overwhelming gender differences in HIV prevalence among young women relative to men in this region. Second, this study's collaboration with the WC-DoSD will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention and is likely to ensure sustainabiliy of the intervention within communities. Third, determining the efficacy of the comprehensive gender intervention for greater application will be essential for the most at-risk female adolescents.",Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to

"Implementing mental health interventions for pregnant adolescents in primary care LMIC contexts SUMMARY High prevalence of adolescent pregnancies in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) has resulted in a tremendous public health burden. Many adolescent pregnancies are unwanted, unplanned, and outside of marriage. When adolescent girls become mothers, their opportunities for economic and educational growth are limited. A burgeoning number of adolescent mothers from LMICs are also marginalized due to poverty or gender-based traditions, which further limit their access to health resources, social protection/ support and personal development. Structural inequalities and adverse circumstances have resulted in high prevalence of depression in adolescent mothers. Despite the enormous mental health needs for adolescent mothers in LMICs, child and adolescent mental health service remains in its’ infancy. There is a need to advance cultural and context-sensitive perinatal depression interventions that can align with adolescents’ living contexts and developmental needs and simultaneously address multiple resource challenges in provision of mental health care in LMIC settings. This application seeks to respond to these adolescent perinatal depression intervention and implementation research gaps by i) utilizing WHO Mental Health Treatment Gap Action Program (mhGAP) and Group Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-G) depression care packages that has shown to be efficacious for adult depression, and further test the approaches in adolescents with perinatal depression in Kenyan maternal and child health (MCH) service settings. Three key research questions will be studied: (i) how to improve fit of the mhGAP/IPT-G-depression intervention model for pregnant adolescents in Kenya, (ii) how to effectively integrate task-shifting/sharing and collaborative strategies with MCH clinical workflow to implement mhGAP/IPT-G depression intervention for pregnant adolescents in MCH settings, and (iii) whether the adapted mhGAP/IPT-G are feasible-acceptable-effective in addressing perinatal depression in adolescents. Considering the demand-resource gap, as MCH clinics usually serve high volume of adolescents with perinatal depression but have limited resources, this study will also explore other cost-effective strategies, such as study feasibility of applying long and mini version of IPT-G and other family/adolescent peer co-lead approach of intervention implementation. This study will be carried out using a cross-disciplinary partnership approach. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) explore barriers and strategies to improve mhGAP-IG/IPT-G fit and implementation for adolescent perinatal depression in MCH clinics in Kenya; 2) Develop adapted version of IPT-G/ and mhGAP-IG, and build MCH capacity for implementation; and 3) test feasibility and implementation-effectiveness outcomes for the adapted version of mhGAP-IG/ IPT-G.

"Prevention of Adolescent Risky Behaviors: Neural Markers of Intervention Effects Adolescence is a time of dramatic biological, behavioral and social changes. It is one of the healthiest periods of the life-span, yet morbidity and mortality rates increase 200%, often attributed to natural tendencies to explore and take risks that increase vulnerability to risky and dangerous behaviors. Rapid advances in developmental neuroscience are revealing new insights into how biology and social context interact to increase adolescents' risk-taking behavior which is attributed to a temporal disassociation between maturational changes in two distinct neural systems: “socio-emotional” (reward) and “cognitive-control” (self-regulation). The socio-emotional system is stimulated by a rapid increase in dopaminergic activity at puberty, which influences reward-seeking behavior. This increase in reward-seeking precedes the maturation of the cognitive-control system and its connections to the reward system. This proposal aims to apply these new insights on neurobiology of adolescents' responses to alcohol/drug use and sex-related risk opportunities by examining brain changes in response to a theoretically- based and empirically-tested prevention program that targets risky behavior in African-American youth during pubertal transition. This racial group is disproportionately affected by the high morbidity and mortality associated with HIV-related risky behaviors and exemplifies a significant health disparity in our society. The intervention was designed on the basis of developmental issues and socio-cultural contextual processes germane to African- American families, and has been shown in randomized controlled trials to delay/deter HIV-related risky behaviors in this vulnerable population. This proposal extends the efficacy studies of the intervention by using functional magnetic resonance imaging to quantify the biological changes in response to the intervention. Identifying neural substrates of the intervention can facilitate refinement of the program by focusing on the components that are most effective in changing behavioral and neural circuitry and also aid in the development of new interventions for subgroups of youth that don't have a positive outcome. Using a randomized controlled design, we will assess the neural substrates of risk-taking and risk-avoidant behavior before and after the 6-week computer-interactive, family-based intervention in 11-13 year-old African-American youth. Psychological processes shown to mediate the intervention effects on behaviors that dissuade alcohol and drug use and sexual onset (i.e. reward-drive and cognitive-emotional self-regulation) will be assessed at baseline and 3 months post-intervention. Based on prior studies that reported observable brain changes in response to psychosocial interventions, our hypothesis is that a positive response to the intervention will be associated with greater functional connectivity changes between the socio-emotional (reward-drive) and cognitive-control (self-regulation) components of the neural circuitry compared to the control condition, both at rest and during task-performance. We also postulate that these neural changes will mediate the intervention's positive effects on psychological processes involved in youth's decision to avoid HIV-risk vulnerability behaviors in the service of long-term personal goals and positive health outcomes. Adolescence is a time of biological and behavioral changes that can lead to risky and dangerous behaviors, and African-American youth are highly vulnerable to the consequences of risky behavior, including HIV/AIDS and violence, leading to premature death. We previously showed that an intervention program reduces HIV-risk vulnerability behaviors in many African-American youth.

"Sex hormone effects on neurodevelopment: Controlled puberty in transgender adolescents Project Summary/Abstract Sex represents a critical variable not only in typical neurodevelopment, but also neuropsychiatric disease. Substantial sex differences have been identified in prevalence, course and outcome of psychiatric disorders, with prior evidence indicating this occurs in a time-dependent fashion throughout the lifespan, with specific epochs in early development and in the pubertal period. Despite clear epidemiological evidence for these disparities, understanding of underlying biological mechanisms in humans is limited. Animal studies suggest a critical role of sex hormones in both developmental periods, however translation of these mechanisms to humans has been hampered by the lack of an experimental model that allows segregation of effects related to early organizational effects and later activational processes in puberty. The recent advent of cross-sex hormone therapy (CSHT) in adolescents with gender dysphoria, presents a unique opportunity to investigate these processes, while also advancing the empirical basis of clinical care for this vulnerable population of youth. While early data from comparable European clinics demonstrated that adolescents in late puberty receiving GnRH treatment showed improved psychological functioning and unanimously opted to proceed with CSHT in late adolescence, there is little to no empirical data guiding clinical practices of CSHT in early pubertal adolescents, highlighting the need for further research to address the critical knowledge gap in this cohort of youth. The research we propose has never been conducted in early pubertal adolescents, an important point given the prevailing theoretical framework which posits that hormonal effects are exerted in defined, time- sensitive developmental windows, with early and permanent organizational effects in the perinatal period, and further activational changes occurring during adolescence. Studying an adolescent cohort is critical for this population as it (1) establishes a neural basis for sex steroid influence in puberty as manifested in brain anatomy and connectivity through a model of gender dysphoria and cross-sex hormone therapy, (2) identifies independent processes by which estrogens and testosterone differentially affect individuals with a natal sex background of either female- or male-typical early organizational effects and (3) maps these findings onto behaviors that are most strongly associated with sexually dimorphic patterns of psychopathology in the adolescent period. Results from this interdisciplinary proposal will provide a much-needed foundation for understanding the longitudinal impact of treatments that are already being used in clinical settings and allow better understanding of risk factors associated with disease that emerges along sex-specific trajectories from the pubertal period, greatly improving clinical outcomes for both typically developing and GD youth. Project Narrative The relatively recent introduction of cross-sex hormone therapy for transgender youth represents a significant shift in clinical practices, however underlying mechanisms for these interventions are poorly understood, particularly during early stages of puberty. This study utilizes comprehensive approaches to examine cross-sex hormone effects on the brain throughout the pubertal period and aims to improve long-term clinical outcomes for transgender youth by elucidating how sex hormone therapy alters sex-specific risk for disease. Delineation of this paradigm also provides critical insight into the role of sex hormones in typical development and their impact on neural networks implicated in psychiatric disorders.",Sex hormone effects on neurodevelopment: Controlled puberty in transgender adolescents,9769144,R01MH115349,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' Moods ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Puberty ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' Testing ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Testosterone ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Hormonal ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' Performance ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' sexual dimorphism ', ' sexually dimorphic ', ' sex dimorphism ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Brain region ', ' GNRH1 gene ', ' Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone ', ' LNRH ', ' Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone 1 ', ' GNRH1 ', ' GNRH ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' brain behavior ', ' mood regulation ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' gender dysphoria ', ' gender dysphoric ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' perinatal period ', ' perinatal phase ', ' neural network ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,738226,0.10149737160562511

"R-CITY: Erasing Racism and Violence through Collaborative Intervention with Teachers and Youth G.220 - R&R Other Project Information Form 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Pervasive exposure to violence in urban areas puts youth at risk for subsequent perpetration of violence, chronic psychological trauma, and mental and behavioral health problems. Yet many urban schools lack resources to provide adequate support. When under-resourced schools are concentrated in racial and ethnic minority communities, health disparities theory suggests this is a reflection of structural racism and discrimination (R/D). Structural R/D is a multi-level, multi-domain construct with societal (e.g., under-resourced segregated schools), institutional (e.g., racial disparities in punitive discipline), interpersonal (e.g., cultural marginalization and teacher implicit bias), and intrapersonal (e.g., internalized stereotypes) forms that may contribute to youth incidence of violence. These examples of structural racism are compounded in Baltimore City Public Schools (City Schools), an urban district serving primarily Black students and families in de facto segregated schools with racial disparities in out-of-school suspension rates. Rigorous research studies by our team have shown that youth violence prevention models such as Coping Power can produce significant reductions in aggressive behavior among early adolescents in City Schools. However, neither Coping Power, nor any other youth violence prevention interventions to our knowledge, have incorporated strategies that move beyond coping with R/D to actively preventing R/D. We hypothesize that integrating R/D prevention strategies with youth violence preventive intervention will result in a synergistic effect, producing greater reductions in aggression than youth violence preventive interventions alone, while reducing structural R/D at multiple levels. The proposed project integrates a universal, classroom-based adaptation of the evidence-based intervention Coping Power for Baltimore City youth with the Double Check professional development and coaching intervention for teachers, administrators, and school police. Called R-CITY (Erasing Racism and Youth Violence through Collaboration with Teachers and Youth), the project builds on our previous federally-funded research adapting and efficacy testing both preventive interventions in middle schools. We propose to assess the “value-added” of integrating Coping Power and Double Check (CP+DC), compared to Coping Power alone (CP Only), using a school-level, RCT in 40 Baltimore City middle schools. We will assess the effects of the integrated CP+DC intervention on youth violence and intrapersonal R/D, on classroom interpersonal R/D (including culturally responsive practices and equitable and inclusive youth engagement), and on school institutional R/D (as measured by youth-report of racial climate and disparities in suspensions). Four cohorts of 10 schools will be randomly assigned each year to receive the integrated CP+DC intervention or to receive CP Only. Assessments of outcomes will be administered at pre-test in the fall, post-test in the spring, and at one-year follow-up. G.220 - R&R Other Project Information Form 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will contribute to the limited number of interventions shown to reduce of youth violence, which is a significant public health concern in the US. This study will show that Coping Power is an effective youth violence prevention intervention designed specifically for school-based implementation.

Her research training includes a masters of public health and fellowships in Adolescent Medicine and Health Policy. Through the activities proposed in this application Dr. Raymond-Flesch will build skills in cross-sectional and longitudinal quantitative data analysis. She will benefit from UCSF's nationally recognized Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine and Institute for Health Policy Studies as well as the university's course work in biostatistics and research methodology. In addition, UCSF will continue to support her productive collaboration with the Salinas Teen Health Study team at RTI. Across these intuitions Dr. Raymond-Flesch has established an experienced mentoring team with expertise in epidemiology, mixed methods research, and adolescent reproductive and mental health. By the completion of this award she will be well positioned to launch a career as an independent investigator, including applying for an R01 award.  Informed by the social ecological model, this proposal builds on the Salinas Teen Health Study (R01- HD075787), a prospective cohort study of 600 Latino adolescents over two years as they transition from early to middle adolescence in a Californian agricultural community. Latino youth experience a variety of health disparities, including higher rates of depression and adverse reproductive health outcomes (unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections). Current evidence links depression with negative sexual and reproductive health outcomes in adults, but there is a paucity of research on these associations in Latino adolescents. Additionally, data on how immigrant generation affects these outcomes for Latino adolescents are limited. Dr. Raymond-Flesch's specific aims include a quantitative analysis of the associations between depressive symptoms and sexual and reproductive health outcomes at baseline across first, second, and third generation Latino early adolescents (Aim 1); longitudinal analysis of two years of quantitative data to determine the effect of depressive symptoms during early adolescence on subsequent sexual and reproductive health (Aim 2); qualitative analysis of youth interviews to describe how emotional wellbeing influences sexual and reproductive health (Aim 3); and qualitative interviews with mothers to characterize early environmental and structural factors affecting emotional wellbeing, psychosocial development, and sexual and reproductive health for Latino youth (Aim 4). The roles of immigrant generation and protective family influences will be examined across all aims. At the conclusion of this award Dr. Raymond-Flesch will apply findings to the development of a R01 application for a culturally informed intervention to reduce mental and reproductive health disparities. Project Narrative Public Health Relevance Latinas have disparately high rates of pregnancy compared to all other racial and ethnic groups of adolescents, with rates highest in California among rural populations, despite falling rates of teen pregnancy nationally. Factors such as emotional health and immigrant generation likely impact engagement in the high risk sexual and reproductive health behaviors that give rise to high rates of teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and other poor health outcomes for these youth, but additional research is needed to understand the individual, family, and structural factors that give rise to these disparities, particularly for youth in agricultural communities. This study uses quantitative and qualitative methods, including questionnaires and interviews with youth and mothers, to prospectively investigate the individual, family, and structural factors that either promote positive youth development or place youth at risk for high risk sexual and reproductive health outcomes such as pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.",Emotional Wellbeing and Reproductive Health in a Prospective Study of Multiple Generations of Immigrant Latino Youth,9748576,K23HD093839,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescent Medicine ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Language ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' adolescents who are pregnant ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Pregnancy Rate ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Rural Population ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Stress ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Partner Communications ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' family structure ', ' eighth grade ', ' 8th grade ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Contraception ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' positive youth development ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' career development ', ' psychosocial development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Master of Public Health ', ' M.P.H.

"Biological Mechanisms of Suicidal Behavior among Sexual Minority Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and nationally representative data indicate 29% of sexual minority adolescents (SMAs) have attempted suicide during the past year. Alarmingly high rates of suicidal behavior in this population can be attributed, in part, to gay-related bullying experienced by SMAs and higher rates of childhood abuse among SMAs. However, mechanisms underlying the association between psychosocial factors and suicidality among SMAs remain unstudied.  The proposed investigation will examine biological mechanisms of suicidal behavior among SMAs. Researchers have recently identified biological mechanisms which distinguish individuals who are at risk for engaging in suicidal behavior, including low hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) and high levels of inflammatory biological markers. Biological mechanisms have high potential to partially explain suicidal behavior disparities between SMAs and non-SMAs, as individuals who experience bullying and childhood abuse are more likely to evidence biological dysregulation during adolescence and into adulthood. The proposed K01 study will examine how biological mechanisms (HCC and inflammatory markers) are associated with gay-related bullying, and how biological mechanisms predict clinical and neurocognitive correlates of suicidal behavior (suicidal ideation, impulsivity, and decision-making) among SMAs and non-SMAs. The proposed study will be the first in a program of research designed to facilitate more effective identification of SMAs at risk for suicidal behavior and identify psychosocial, biological, and neurocognitive factors which can be targeted within interventions designed to attenuate stark disparities in suicidal behavior between SMAs and non-SMAs.  To launch this program of research, the candidate will augment his prior training in social and behavioral determinants of SMA health with training in biological mechanisms of suicidal behavior, conducting longitudinal research and analyzing longitudinal data, and neurocognitive correlates of suicidal behavior. He has an ideal mentorship team within an optimal scientific training environment to undertake the proposed research and training plans. Primary Mentor Dr. Nadine Melhem has significant expertise in biological mechanisms of suicidal behavior and longitudinal research methods. Co-Mentor Dr. Michael Marshal is an expert on SMA mental health disparities, including suicidality. The candidate will also receive mentoring from internal Consultant Dr. Anna Marsland, a leading scholar in psychoneuroimmunology, internal Consultant Dr. Kehui Chen, a statistician with ongoing collaborations with Dr. Melhem, and external Consultant Dr. Jeffrey Bridge, who contributes expertise in neurocognitive risk for suicidal behavior among adolescents. Completion of the proposed research and training plans will position the candidate as a leading scholar in SMA suicidal behavior, preparing him to examine this pressing mental health disparity longitudinally across adolescence and at multiple levels of analysis. Project Narrative  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and sexual minority adolescents (SMAs) have extremely high rates of suicidality. The proposed study will be the first within a broader program of research to examine how biological mechanisms of suicidal behavior, including dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and chronic low-grade inflammation, contribute to disproportionate rates of suicidal behavior among SMAs. Knowledge gained from this research has the potential to attenuate alarming rates of suicidal behavior among SMAs by 1) facilitating more effective identification of SMAs at risk for suicidal behavior, and 2) identifying promising psychosocial, biological, and neurocognitive intervention targets to reduce suicidality within this vulnerable population.",Biological Mechanisms of Suicidal Behavior among Sexual Minority Adolescents,9739511,K01MH117142,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Childhood Abuse ', ' Child Abuse ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gambling ', ' Hair ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interview ', ' Iowa ', ' Literature ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' psychoneuroimmunological ', ' Psychoneuroimmunology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Shame ', ' Stigmatization ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Time ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' sexually abused ', ' sex abuse ', ' Attenuated ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' ideation ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Marshal ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' physical abuse ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' suicide attempter ', ' suicidal adolescent ', ' suicidal youth ', ' demographics ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' reducing suicide ', ' reducing suicidality ', ' reduce suicide ', ' reduce suicidality ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' sexual minority ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Same-sex ', ' adolescent health ', ' recruit ', ' biological sex ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2019,169070,0.05040003779009624
"A Digital Intervention for HIV Prevention in Black Adolescent Girls PROJECT SUMMARY Black women are disproportionately diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Black women often contract HIV/STIs through high-risk sex and adolescence is when these behaviors are more common. Furthermore, Black adolescent girls are more affected by HIV/STIs than other demographics of adolescent girls; yet, there are few engaging and effective interventions designed exclusively for them. In fact, many are unaware of their partner HIV/STI status and do not consistently use condoms to protect themselves. Therefore, interventions that counter individual-level risk perception by promoting HIV/STI testing for themselves and their partners and reduce risk behaviors, such as non-condom use, are greatly needed. There is compelling evidence that peers play a significant role in the protection from risk associated with HIV/STIs by providing opportunities to exchange knowledge, influence attitudes, and to develop new behavioral skills. Videogame interventions, which are frequently played with others, can be culturally tailored, provide behavioral skills training, and have demonstrated efficacy in affecting health behaviors related to health promotion. With the growing evidence for the efficacy of videogames in improving health outcomes, it is essential to examine how to harness these technologies to modify behaviors in Black adolescent girls. With funding from the Women’s Health Research at Yale Pilot Program, the Yale’s play2PREVENT Lab developed and pilot tested a theory-based social card game intervention, One Night Stan, which was aimed at increasing partner HIV/STI testing and condom use in young black women aged 18- 24. Preliminary findings of a pilot study conducted with 21 black women aged 18-21 suggest that playing the game can lead to increased self-efficacy and intentions to use condoms and insist that their partners get tested for HIV across time. In terms of gameplay satisfaction, 100% of participants reported that that they would play the game again, 95% liked the way the game looked, 100% enjoyed playing the game, and 100% reported that they would tell their friends to play. Results from this study suggest that One Night Stan is a feasible intervention approach and may be efficacious in helping players develop a pattern of cognitions and motivation that can protect them against the risk of HIV. Together, a team comprised of experts from the Yale Center for Health & Leaning Games will build upon this formative work and pilot data to adapt One Night Stan to a multiplayer videogame for younger target audience of Black adolescent girls. For this proposal, we will evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of One Night Stan at increasing self and partner HIV/STI testing by conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial with 80 young Black adolescent girls ages 14-18. We will also explore the efficacy of the intervention for increasing players’ HIV/STI knowledge and for increasing intentions and attitudes around safer HIV/STI practices. As a multiplayer videogame, the intervention is a compelling framework for Black adolescent girls who constantly interact and are influenced by their peers. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE This project is designed to develop and test a multiplayer videogame intervention for adolescent black girls ages 14-18. The goal of this proposal is to increase HIV/STI self and partner testing and reduce sexual risk behaviors such as non-condom use in order to decrease their risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Because the game will be played with adolescent females and their peers, this project has the potential to spread beyond the individual to influence public health and decrease the number of new cases of HIV/STI.",A Digital Intervention for HIV Prevention in Black Adolescent Girls,9695489,R21HD098031,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Counseling ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Leanness ', ' Thinness ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' satisfaction ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' life-style risk reduction ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Individual Adjustment ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' unprotected intercourse ', ' condomless sex ', ' condomless intercourse ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' skills training ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' high risk behavior ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' risk perception ', ' behavioral health ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' NICHD ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' trial comparing ', ' demographics ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' psychosocial adjustment ', ' sexual risk taking ', ' videogame intervention ', ' attentional control ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' ']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,209375,0.11308364957152661
"Building Mobile Technologies to Reduce Health Disparities in Congenital Heart Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growing congenital heart disease adolescent survivor population faces two major health disparities in care: (1) poor care transition (an age and developmentally appropriate process, addressing the medical, psychosocial and educational/vocational aspects of care) from child-centered to adult-centered healthcare; and (2) lack of appropriate transfer of care (the point at which an adult cardiac provider assumes the medical care of a CHD patient). The transition period is a vulnerable time for adolescents with CHD, and many drop-out from active health care. Dropping out leads to poor health outcomes, and does not allow for appropriate transfer to adult care. The newly validated SMART (Socio-ecological Model of Adolescent & young adult Readiness for Transition) model has the potential to improve this process, by targeting modifiable variables for intervention in the transition and transfer process through assessments of five parameters: adolescent socio-demographics, disease characteristics and knowledge, skills/self-efficacy, relationships and psychosocial functioning. Using SMART, our research will engage CHD adolescents and promote transition and transfer using a modality that universally defines their generation: mobile technology. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify transition needs for CHD adolescents, facilitate transfer of care, and adapt SMART for these needs by developing and piloting an interactive e-health (mobile based) platform that will promote the key knowledge and skills that adolescents need to successfully transition and transfer to adult care. The mobile-based platform will target modifiable variables to improve transition and transfer of care for CHD adolescents. To achieve these goals, the Specific Aims include:  Aim 1: Complete a stakeholder needs assessment of CHD adolescents, parents, pediatric cardiology and adult congenital providers. We will assess baseline competencies in self-management, key skills, health literacy (HL), and transition readiness (TR) of CHD adolescents. Hypothesis: Low adolescent HL scores will correlate with low TR and low parental HL. Needs assessment will inform the educational content and design of our e-health platform.  Aim 2: Design and develop the educational content for a mobile e-health platform informed by:  modifiable variables in the SMART model, the existing literature on CHD knowledge gaps in adolescents,  the needs assessment, adaptation of an existing mentorship program, and varying levels of HL and TR. A formative iterative process with adolescents of various HL and TR levels will be used to further develop the content and design of this mobile-based e-health application to enhance adolescent transition.  Aim 3: Conduct a pilot study of the mobile-based platform to assess feasibility, adolescent recruitment and engagement, and facilitate the transition and transfer process. Improving transition and transfer are critical to successful long-term disease management and survival. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    The proposed research is relevant to public health because it addresses the needs of Americans who are surviving and living with congenital heart disease (CHD). This research plan is unique, timely, and of high public health significance as it applies mobile technologies to streamline transition and transfer of care for adolescents with CHD or other chronic diseases. Furthermore, it provides a strategy to reduce disparities in minority CHD populations and low health literacy families.",Building Mobile Technologies to Reduce Health Disparities in Congenital Heart Disease,9766407,K23HL127164,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Belief ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dropout ', ' Elements ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Survivors ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Health Transition ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' psychosocial ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' American ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' health application ', ' public health relevance ', ' efficacy testing ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Pediatric cardiology ', ' adolescent health ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' palliate ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K23,2019,158565,0.11767519502130874
"Mucosal injury from sexual practices: Behaviour and biology of South African adolescents ABSTRACT Globally and in sub-Saharan Africa, adolescent females are at highest risk for HIV. In this region, there are also high levels of gender-based violence and a cultural preference for dry sex. Young women in Southern Africa become sexually active at around 15 years of age similar to those in the US9 and UK10. Adolescence is associated with significant changes in hormone levels, resulting in changes in cervical anatomy that could put them at risk for HIV. Vaginal insertion practices (VIPs) are common in women in sub-Saharan Africa. These VIPs [including intravaginal use of cloth or paper, insertion of products to dry/tighten the vagina and intravaginal cleansing with soap were associated with increased risk for HIV infection5. In four different studies conducted in South Africa, VIP prevalence ranged from 17.9% to 90.1%, depending on the population studied, with the predominant practices being intravaginal washing with soap, cloth or tissue paper for cleansing5. Relationship power inequity and intimate partner violence increase risk of incident HIV infection in young South African women20 This study will evaluate the hypothesis that in adolescent women, sexual immaturity, use of vaginal products and gender-based violence increase genital inflammation, damage the mucosa, alter the vaginal flora, which influences genital HIV target cell availability. To address this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims using two cohorts of HIV-negative SA adolescents in regions differentially at risk for HIV infection and with differing cultural norms for vaginal product use. We propose to enroll 300 adolescent females (aged 14-19 years) and 100 adult women (aged 25-35) and cluster them according to VIP use: (1) nothing (control); (2) using cloth or paper to wipe out the vagina; (3) intravaginal cleansing with soap; (4) intravaginal cleaning with household cleaners; or (5) products to dry/tighten vagina. Information about exposure to gender-based violence will be collected through the questionnaire. At baseline, examination of the cervix; vaginal vaginal flora, and imunity will be assessed. All women will be followed longitudinally for two consecutive sexual exposures. Women will be evaluated at baseline, <48 hours following sex (trauma visit), and at 7 days (wound healing). Comparing each subject to their own baseline, to the control arm, and to adult women, and building on adolescent trial experience at both clinical sites involved are strengths of this study design. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1. To examine anatomical and immunological characteristics of the adolescent state that may contribute to higher inflammation in the reproductive tract, hence HIV risk 2. To compare inflammatory responses to VIPs and sexual violence in adolescent females and older women The study outlined here may uncover why African adolescents are so disproportionately affected by HIV and has the potential to dramatically influence public health messaging about VIPs and sexual violence to adolescents in developing countries. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, adolescent females are the highest risk group for HIV, and vaginal trauma potentially increases this risk. This proposal will evaluate the effects of adolescent genital biology and the effects of vaginal trauma on vaginal immunology and microbiome. The goal of these studies is to inform clinical trials and messaging for adolescent females in developing countries so that they can effectively prevent their risk of HIV infection.",Mucosal injury

"Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to Reach Vulnerable Young Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Vulnerable female adolescents in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town who use alcohol and other drugs (AOD) and have dropped out of school experience the greatest burden of new HIV infections in South Africa. The risk for acquiring HIV is perpetuated through intersecting factors of AOD use, gender inequality, sexual risk, victimization, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence. Despite the pervasive ongoing transmission of HIV, this vulnerable population remains underserved by current HIV and drug treatment programs, with few providing HIV testing and counselling (HTC), antenatal care, or substance abuse rehabilitation, and none providing comprehensive HTC programs that address these intersecting risks for HIV among this population. Since 2001, we have adapted and conducted a comprehensive evidence-based intervention for women, the Women's Health CoOp (WHC), that addresses AOD use, sexual risk, and gender-based violence. The WHC was listed in the USAID Compendium of Gender Studies in Africa. The Young Women's CoOp (YWC) is an adaptation of the WHC that targets this vulnerable population of AOD using female adolescents. This proposed RFA project seeks to reach this hard-to-reach population and overcome barriers to improved health for female adolescents who have dropped out of school by increasing update of HTC through a comprehensive gender-focused HTC intervention with trained peer co-facilitators and outreach workers from each community. The study findings may provide knowledge that could be used to increase the uptake of services and improve treatment adherence among female adolescents through the use of peer-driven intervention methods. Specific Aims: Our specific aims including the following. In a cluster randomized trial conducted in 12 disadvantaged communities in Cape Town, South Africa, and with government collaboration, we propose: Aim 1. To train and evaluate adolescent peer role models to conduct community outreach with established outreach workers to recruit 500 out-of schools, substance-using female adolescents aged 15-19 for HTC, and to co-facilitate a gender-focused comprehensive HTC program. Aim 2. To test the efficacy of a young women's gender-focused comprehensive HTC program for reducing substance use, victimization, and sexual risk behavior (primary outcomes) and improving access to effective treatment and support services through linkages to care (substance abuse treatment, HIV, STIs, antenatal and reproductive health as secondary outcomes) relative to standard HTC for adolescent females. This study's collaboration with the Western Cape-Department of Social Development and the City of Cape Town will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention within community centers will most likely ensure greater sustainability where it is needed most. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact for the proposed study is tri-fold and described as follows. First, reaching 500 adolescent females in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town with its high rates of school dropout (and often consequent unemployment), substance use, gender inequality, sexual risk, unplanned pregnancy, and gang violence is essential for HTC and risk reduction, as these intersecting risk factors appear to be antecedents to the overwhelming gender differences in HIV prevalence among young women relative to men in this region. Second, this study's collaboration with the WC-DoSD will also empower peers trained to conduct outreach and co-facilitate the intervention and is likely to ensure sustainabiliy of the intervention within communities. Third, determining the efficacy of the comprehensive gender intervention for greater application will be essential for the most at-risk female adolescents.",Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to

"Guys/Girls Opt for Activities for Life (GOAL) Trial Abstract Inadequate physical activity and poor diet quality contribute to the high overweight/obesity (OW/O) prevalence in adolescents, aged 12-19 years, indicating a need to intervene at or before age 12. Compared with other adolescents, underserved (minority; low socioeconomic status) adolescents in urban areas exhibit more unhealthy behaviors that increase their risk for obesity and related cardiovascular disease (CVD). Guided by Self-Determination Theory and the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model, the novel 16-week Guys/Girls Opt for Activities for Life (GOAL) intervention includes 3 components: 1) After-school GOAL Club: 26 120-minute events (2 days/week) for boys and girls that incorporate physical activity and healthy eating and cooking; 2) Three parent-adolescent dyad meetings to empower dyads about physical activity and healthy eating and cooking; and 3) GOAL social networking website so parents can motivate each other to help their adolescents increase physical activity and diet quality. The purpose of this 5-yr group randomized trial (unit of assignment is school) is to evaluate the effect of GOAL on decreasing CVD risk factors (high % body fat, OW/O, low CV fitness), improving quality of life (QOL); and increasing motivation, self-efficacy, and social support to increase MVPA and diet quality among underserved adolescents (5th–7th grade) having BMI z-score ≥0. The long-term goal is to improve the CV health of underserved adolescents to decrease health disparities, a major priority of NHLBI. Eighteen schools will be randomly assigned to receive either GOAL (n=9) or usual school offerings control (n=9) condition. Forty dyads of boys (n=20) and girls (n=20) in each school and one parent per adolescent who is willing to serve as a support person will be enrolled (720 dyads total). Analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. Aims are to evaluate effect of the GOAL intervention, compared to control, on: (1) Improving % body fat (primary outcome) by ≥2.5% between intervention and control adolescents with a BMI z-score ≥0 from baseline (0 months) to 4 months (immediate post-intervention) and to 13 months post-baseline (9-mon. F/U); (2) Increasing secondary proximal outcomes among adolescents: MVPA (via accelerometers; min/hr) and diet quality (healthy eating index based on 3 24-hr dietary recalls) from 0 to 4 months; (3) Improving secondary distal outcomes: CV fitness (Progressive Aerobic CV Endurance Run, [15- or 20-m shuttle run]) from 0 to 4 months; and BMI, OW/O percentage, & QOL from 0 to 4 months and to 13 months; and (4) Increasing social support, self-efficacy, and motivation with evaluation of any mediating effect on adolescent PA and diet quality. An exploratory aim (parents) is to evaluate any effect of GOAL, compared to control, on: (1) Improving parents’ perceived family nutrition and PA, MVPA (via accelerometers), and diet quality (fruit-vegetable-fiber screener) from 0 to 4 months; and (2) Reducing parents’ % body fat and BMI from 0 to 4 months and to 13 months. Project Narrative The novel and theory-driven 16-week “Guys/Girls Opt for Activities for Life” (GOAL) school- and home-based intervention addresses the high overweight and obesity prevalence among U.S. adolescents and the underrepresentation of those who are underserved in prevention research. To address these vital public health priorities, a rigorous group RCT will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the GOAL intervention in improving healthy eating and physical activity and perceptions related to both behaviors, as well as anthropometric outcomes among urban, racially diverse, adolescents of low socioeconomic status. The intervention is expected to reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors among at-risk adolescents and contribute toward reducing health disparities, a major priority of the NIH and CDC Division of Adolescent and School Health.",Guys/Girls Opt for Activities for Life (GOAL) Trial,9821911,R61HL144896,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Privatization ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' health in school ', ' school health ', ' Schools ', ' Self Determination ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Mediating ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Distal ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' satisfaction ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Phase II Clinical Trials ', ' phase II protocol ', ' phase 2 trial ', ' Phase 2 Clinical Trials ', ' cooking ', ' Body fat ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' meetings ', ' cohort ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Prevention Research ', ' seventh grade ', ' 7th grade ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Aerobic ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Training ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' early onset ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' post intervention ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' Obesity associated cardiovascular disease ', ' Obesity related cardiovascular disease ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk of obesity ', ' risk for obesity ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' social networking website ', ' web-based social networking ', ' social networking web site ', ' social networking site ', ' online social networking ', ' on-line social networking ', ' obesogenic ', ' obesigenic ', ' public health priorities ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ', ' adolescent health ', ' underserved minority ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NHLBI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R61,2019,788377,0.10582146379407814
"An Intersectional Mixed-Method Examination of Multi-Level Determinants of Adolescent Sexual Minority Health and Substance Use The goal of this study is to investigate how sexual minority (SM) adolescents’ behavioral health (BH) is shaped by their experience of multiple, intersecting and mutually constitutive identities and their interactions with larger, social-structural systems of privilege and disadvantage. At its core, this study is concerned with developing an intersectional understanding of the socio-ecological risk and protective environments1 in which SM adolescents live. This research is of urgent relevance to public health because it will provide empirical research findings that improve our understanding of the landscape of SM BH disparities and thus better equip us to address these disparities. The proposed project will facilitate NIMHD’s vision of disseminating effective multi-level interventions to reduce and eliminate BH disparities by making clear how best to develop and implement interventions targeting these outcomes. To achieve these goals, this project will analyze quantitative and qualitative secondary data using a mixed-method approach that emphasizes the particular strengths of each data source. Quantitative analyses will include structural equation modeling (SEM) and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) techniques to investigate the role of ecological context in moderating BH outcomes of SM youth populations as captured by the New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey (YRRS). These analytic techniques can provide an understanding of the ways in which different social statuses intersect to shape adolescents’ mental health (MH) and substance use (SU). Models will be created for youth of each sexual identity category (lesbian/gay, bisexual, and questioning/not sure) in order to examine how BH outcomes differ based on their sexual identity, sex, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), race, and ethnicity. These quantitative analyses will overcome limitations of previous research in this area by capitalizing on the strengths of the large and diverse nature of the YRRS sample to investigate differences in MH and SU pathways within SM populations. Qualitative data will be comprised of 96 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with school professionals that were conducted in the course of baseline data collection for the NICHD-funded Reducing LGBT Adolescent Suicide (RLAS) trial (PIs: Cathleen Willging and Mary Ramos). These interviews explored staff and teacher attitudes toward SM students, perceptions about how SM students are treated, policies in place to protect SM students, and how schools could better serve SM students. Staff and teacher interview data will be used to contextualize and add descriptive detail to quantitative results, as well as to expand our understanding of how school teachers, administrators, and nurses perceive the contextual supports and barriers faced by SM students. These individuals are uniquely situated to not only share their own role in shaping adolescents’ experiences at school, but also to be witnesses of the micro-level interactions of students and staff and the impact of macro- and meso-level interactions that students have with the institution and their communities. Project Narrative This study explores the impact of interpersonal and social-structural determinants of sexual minority (SM) youth behavioral health (BH) with the goal of increasing understanding of the significant health disparities experienced by these youth and identifying the most effective sites and approaches for multi-level interventions that promote resilience and reduce disparities. This study will examine the different ways that micro-, meso-, and macro-level factors are related to SM youth mental health (MH) and substance use using quantitative methods designed to analyze contextual effects and test individual outcome pathways as well as qualitative methods that will illuminate the unique perspective of school professionals regarding the forces that shape SM BH. The proposed research will provide a more nuanced understanding of the landscape of SM disparities in BH outcomes through its use of both large N quantitative data to disaggregate outcomes and contextual predictors for different SM identity groups and in-depth qualitative data that will allow for triangulation of results.",An Intersectional Mixed-Method Examination of Multi-Level Determinants of Adolescent Sexual Minority Health and Substance Use,9833920,F31MD014044,"['psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Linear Models ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' New Mexico ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Social Change ', ' Social modification ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Attenuated ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' critical period ', ' population based ', ' substance using adolescents ', ' sexual minority ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' High School Student ', ' minority student ', ' ethnic identity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' substance misuse ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' minority communities ', ' protective factors ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' sexual identity ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2019,34707,0.020549859312796463
"Reducing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption among young adults: A point-of-selection experiment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of adolescent and adult obesity is higher than it has ever been in the U.S, driving population risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Robust evidence indicates that consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) increases the risk of developing obesity. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Academy of Medicine have called for broad action to reduce SSB consumption, little is known about how to effectively do so in the age group that consumes the greatest amount of SSBs— older adolescents and young adults. One promising and potentially scalable approach is the use of SSB health warning labels. Although the effect of warning labels on SSB consumption has not yet been studied, warning labels have successfully been used to curb smoking, and in recent online experiments, were found to reduce hypothetical selection of SSBs. This study proposes to use qualitative methods and a formative experiment to develop a legally viable and salient SSB warning label format for adolescents and young adults. Then, a quasi- experimental design will test the impact of a prominent front-of-dispenser SSB warning label on university students’ beverage consumption, comparing outcomes in an intervention cafeteria to those in a control cafeteria. The college setting provides a feasible means of reaching close to half of all 18-to-24 year olds in the U.S. I am pursuing the NIDDK K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to fill critical training gaps in (1) the design, conduct, and analysis of intervention studies and (2) understanding of factors driving consumer decision-making. This award will build upon my advanced training in nutritional epidemiology and development of measures to assess dietary intake and food environments. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator who will reduce the prevalence of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases by identifying a spectrum of scalable and effective interventions that can “nudge” consumers toward healthier dietary choices. The skills I seek to obtain will be critical in achieving this goal. My detailed training plan includes formal coursework at UC Berkeley and UCSF, mentored experience, meetings, seminars, and directed readings. The research component of this project will provide opportunities to integrate new knowledge into practical research experience. Together, the training and protected time provided by the K01 award, combined with the rich collaborative environment and strong institutional support at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, will facilitate my transition into an independent investigator who can successfully compete for R01 funding. It will also provide the means to help me become a leader in the development and testing of scalable food environment and policy interventions that will reduce population risk of diet-related chronic diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE The prevalence of adolescent and adult obesity is higher than it has ever been in the U.S., and strong evidence indicates that sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are a major contributor to unhealthy weight gain and type 2 diabetes. Little is known about scalable approaches to reduce SSB consumption in older adolescents and adults, but a promising approach used in tobacco control that has been unstudied for SSB consumption is product warning labels. The proposed study will test the impact of SSB health warning labels on SSB consumption among adolescents and young adults in a cafeteria setting, which, if found to be effective, may be an approach scalable to policy and defined locations like colleges and workplaces.",Reducing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption among young adults: A point-of-selection experiment,9617726,K01DK113068,"['Academy

"Adolescent Marijuana Use and Marijuana Possession Arrests: Have Changes in Marijuana Policy Affected Disparities Between Blacks and Whites? Project Summary We address important knowledge gaps involving how changes in marijuana policy affect adolescents, especially the effectiveness of these policies at attending to longstanding racial disparities. We will investigate how changes in marijuana policy affect marijuana possession arrests, which can have life- long negative consequences. We will also identify states where policy change could be related to disparities in marijuana use. To our knowledge, neither of these topics has been covered in the academic literature. Our primary goal is to assess how the timing of the implementation of medical marijuana laws, marijuana decriminalization, and marijuana legalization are related to changes in: (1) race-based differences in adolescent marijuana use within states over time, (2) adolescent marijuana possession arrest rates, and (3) the disparity between Black and White adolescent marijuana possession arrests. For comparison, we will also assess how these policies have affected adult arrests and rates of use, since they typically target adult use specifically. While the focus of the study is on longstanding racial disparities, we will also explore differences by sex. We will compare states that have implemented one of these marijuana policies to a “synthetic control” state constructed from outcomes and covariates from states without a policy. This data-driven modeling procedure creates a synthetic counterfactual that is not limited by confounding introduced by changes over time that might occur in unexposed control states. This will allow us to focus on specific policy environments, which vary widely by state. In Aim 1 we examine whether state-level medical marijuana, marijuana legalization and marijuana decriminalization policies have led to an overall decline in adolescent arrests for marijuana possession. We hypothesize that changes in marijuana policy have been associated with an overall decline in adolescent marijuana possession arrests. In Aim 2 we determine whether there are differences in adolescent marijuana possession arrests based on race and sex. We hypothesize that White male and female adolescents have benefitted disproportionately from any decrease in marijuana possession arrests related to a change in marijuana policy. In Aim 3 we investigate whether differences in adolescent marijuana use at the state level account for any arrest disparities. We hypothesize that any disparities in marijuana possession arrests can be explained by between-groups differences in marijuana use. We will also explore apparent differences in marijuana use disparities within states over time and note obvious relationships between marijuana policy implementation and adolescent marijuana use disparities. Project Narrative The need to reduce racial disparities in marijuana arrests is often used to justify marijuana decriminalization and legalization. However, it is unknown how these policies affect longstanding disparities in marijuana arrests or use, especially for adolescents, for whom early arrest can have life-long negative consequences. This project will assess how changes in medical marijuana laws, marijuana decriminalization and marijuana legalization have affected disparities in adolescent marijuana arrests and marijuana use.",Adolescent Marijuana Use and Marijuana Possession Arrests: Have Changes in Marijuana Policy Affected Disparities Between Blacks and Whites?,9700631,R03DA046757,"['Academy ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Peer Review ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' academic review ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' American ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' sex ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' social health determinants ', ' Medical Marijuana ', ' medicinal cannabis ', ' medical cannabis ', ' Medicinal Marijuana ', ' Adolescent marijuana use ', ' marijuana use in adolescence ', ' marijuana use among adolescents ', ' cannabis use among adolescents ', ' marijuana decriminalization ', ' decriminalize marijuana ', ' decriminalize cannabis ', ' cannabis decriminalization ', ' marijuana legalization ', ' legalized marijuana ', ' legalized cannabis ', ' legal marijuana ', ' cannabis legalization ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' marijuana use ', ' cannabis use ', ' THC use ', ' THC co-use ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NIDA,EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL,R03,2019,80374,0.17121912084982077
"Improving the Reproductive Health of Families Adolescents in Botswana face extraordinary reproductive health challenges. Teen pregnancy forces girls to leave school after which few resume their education. Botswana has the second highest HIV prevalence in the world, with incidence increasing rapidly at ages 15-19, peaking at 40.2% prevalence by ages 30-34. STIs are prevalent despite the availability of free health care. Traditional sex education, provided in now banned village initiation schools, is no longer available and parents are uncomfortable discussing reproductive health within the family. In an earlier R34 award, guided by a Community Advisory Board and Adolescent Advisory Group, we conducted formative interviews, assessed the psychometric adequacy of the proposed measures, and adapted and assessed the feasibility and acceptability of interventions for youth and their parents. We now propose to conduct a 3-arm randomized controlled trial with 500 families, ½ with a male and ½ with a female adolescent age 13-18. Arm 1 (N = 200) will receive the parent intervention “Families Matter 2!” (FM2!) and their adolescent will participate in “Living as a Safer Teen” (LAST). In Arm 2 (N = 200), parents receive FM2! Only and six months later their adolescents will receive LAST allowing us to assess the impact of the parent program alone and potential boost in outcomes when adolescents are also engaged in intervention. Arm 3 (N = 100), the comparison arm, will be the current, widely-delivered program in Botswana. Each adolescent and parent dyad will complete ACASI assessments in English or Setswana at baseline, post-intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-ups on family communication, parenting practices, knowledge of sexual development, and sexual behavior. Youth will also complete psychosocial measures assessing attitudes toward condoms, perceived barriers to sexual safety, attitudes toward transactional sex, acceptance of gender violence, and self-efficacy. Gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will be tested at baseline and 12-month follow-up for adolescents. A pilot trial affirmed the feasibility of recruiting parent(caretaker)/adolescent dyads and retention exceeded 95% for both parents and adolescents. While the pilot trial was underpowered, results suggest that the interventions improved family communication, child management skills, knowledge of sexual development, attitudes toward contraception; lowered tolerance for intergenerational transactional sex and gender violence; and lowered sexual risk behavior of both parents and adolescents in the intervention arm. In addition, youths who were abstinent upon entering the pilot intervention appear to have delayed sexual debut more successfully than the comparison arm. This study addresses the highest priority in Botswana’s current national strategic plan. If the results provide strong evidence of effectiveness, the Ministries of Education, Health, Youth & Culture, National AIDS Coordinating Agency, and the Office of the President have committed to its dissemination throughout Botswana. This application proposes to deliver and evaluate a pilot-tested multi-level reproductive health intervention for Batswana adolescents and their parents. The study will evaluate interventions designed to improve reproductive health outcomes for adolescents and their families that are designed to have high public health impact. Program impact will be evaluated with cognitive, behavioral, biomedical and cost effectiveness endpoints from baseline across the following year and the results have broad applicability throughout

"Mucosal injury from sexual practices: Behaviour and biology of South African adolescents ABSTRACT Globally and in sub-Saharan Africa, adolescent females are at highest risk for HIV. In this region, there are also high levels of gender-based violence and a cultural preference for dry sex. Young women in Southern Africa become sexually active at around 15 years of age similar to those in the US9 and UK10. Adolescence is associated with significant changes in hormone levels, resulting in changes in cervical anatomy that could put them at risk for HIV. Vaginal insertion practices (VIPs) are common in women in sub-Saharan Africa. These VIPs [including intravaginal use of cloth or paper, insertion of products to dry/tighten the vagina and intravaginal cleansing with soap were associated with increased risk for HIV infection5. In four different studies conducted in South Africa, VIP prevalence ranged from 17.9% to 90.1%, depending on the population studied, with the predominant practices being intravaginal washing with soap, cloth or tissue paper for cleansing5. Relationship power inequity and intimate partner violence increase risk of incident HIV infection in young South African women20 This study will evaluate the hypothesis that in adolescent women, sexual immaturity, use of vaginal products and gender-based violence increase genital inflammation, damage the mucosa, alter the vaginal flora, which influences genital HIV target cell availability. To address this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims using two cohorts of HIV-negative SA adolescents in regions differentially at risk for HIV infection and with differing cultural norms for vaginal product use. We propose to enroll 300 adolescent females (aged 14-19 years) and 100 adult women (aged 25-35) and cluster them according to VIP use: (1) nothing (control); (2) using cloth or paper to wipe out the vagina; (3) intravaginal cleansing with soap; (4) intravaginal cleaning with household cleaners; or (5) products to dry/tighten vagina. Information about exposure to gender-based violence will be collected through the questionnaire. At baseline, examination of the cervix; vaginal vaginal flora, and imunity will be assessed. All women will be followed longitudinally for two consecutive sexual exposures. Women will be evaluated at baseline, <48 hours following sex (trauma visit), and at 7 days (wound healing). Comparing each subject to their own baseline, to the control arm, and to adult women, and building on adolescent trial experience at both clinical sites involved are strengths of this study design. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1. To examine anatomical and immunological characteristics of the adolescent state that may contribute to higher inflammation in the reproductive tract, hence HIV risk 2. To compare inflammatory responses to VIPs and sexual violence in adolescent females and older women The study outlined here may uncover why African adolescents are so disproportionately affected by HIV and has the potential to dramatically influence public health messaging about VIPs and sexual violence to adolescents in developing countries. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, adolescent females are the highest risk group for HIV, and vaginal trauma potentially increases this risk. This proposal will evaluate the effects of adolescent genital biology and the effects of vaginal trauma on vaginal immunology and microbiome. The goal of these studies is to inform clinical trials and messaging for adolescent females in developing countries so that they can effectively prevent their risk of HIV infection.",Mucosal injury

"Individually tailored physical activity intervention for Latina adolescents: Ninas Saludables Abstract Latina adolescents report low levels of physical activity, with only 3% meeting national physical activity guidelines, and are at high lifetime risk for conditions related to inactivity, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Interventions grounded in sound psychosocial theory and leveraging growing technology use in Latina adolescents are needed to reverse patterns of inactivity, establish healthy lifetime habits and reduce widening disparities. Our research team has developed and tested individually tailored web-based interventions to increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), which significantly increased MVPA in Latina adults. In our recent pilot study (R03NR014329), we adapted this intervention based on formative interviews to make it appropriate for Latina adolescents and tested it in a single-arm pilot trial (N=21). After 12 weeks, retention was high (90.5%) and self-reported MVPA increased from 24.7(26.11) minutes/week at baseline to 79.4(46.8) at follow up (p<0.001), suggesting good potential efficacy. In closeout interviews, girls expressed a preference to increase audio-video components of the website and to incorporate other mobile- health technologies, such as texting, smartphone apps, social networks, and wearables. Thus, the aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=200) of an individually tailored, theory-based, multi- technology intervention to increase MVPA in Latina adolescents. The 12-month intervention will comprise a counseling session to teach behavior change techniques, an interactive multimedia website with individually tailored content, a wearable tracker and smartphone app to reinforce behavior change techniques, connection to an Instagram account reinforcing web content, and automated text messages to guide continued goal setting. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention or only a wearable tracker. Activity will be measured at baseline, six-months (primary outcome) and 12 months using well-established MVPA measures (accelerometers and the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Interview). We hypothesize that those randomized to receive the intervention will show significantly greater increases in MVPA at six months than those in the control group. We will also evaluate whether changes in MVPA are mediated by changes in targeted psychosocial constructs (e.g. self-efficacy, social support), and whether intervention effects are moderated by baseline personal and environmental variables (e.g. age, BMI, neighborhood environment). Costs to deliver the intervention (e.g. staff time, materials, overhead) will be tracked to evaluate costs and cost- effectiveness of both study arms, and we will evaluate the effects of contact time out outcomes. We will also explore trajectories of daily activity in both the intervention and control groups using continuous data from wearable trackers. The proposed study will promote a critical preventive health behavior, physical activity, in Latina adolescents using technologies that are pervasive in this high risk population and highly scalable, laying the groundwork for cost-effective, broad reaching interventions with great potential for public health impact. Project Narrative: Latina adolescents report high rates of inactivity and are at especially high lifetime risk for diabetes, obesity, and other lifestyle-related conditions. The proposed study seeks to promote physical activity among this at-risk, understudied population by conducting a randomized controlled trial of an individually tailored, theory-based multi-technology physical activity intervention. The proposed high reach, low cost strategy for increasing physical activity has great potential for adoption on a larger scale and thereby for positively impacting public health, reducing risk of chronic disease and eliminating health disparities in this quickly growing, high risk population.",Individually tailored physical activity intervention for Latina adolescents: Ninas

"Biological Mechanisms of Suicidal Behavior among Sexual Minority Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and nationally representative data indicate 29% of sexual minority adolescents (SMAs) have attempted suicide during the past year. Alarmingly high rates of suicidal behavior in this population can be attributed, in part, to gay-related bullying experienced by SMAs and higher rates of childhood abuse among SMAs. However, mechanisms underlying the association between psychosocial factors and suicidality among SMAs remain unstudied.  The proposed investigation will examine biological mechanisms of suicidal behavior among SMAs. Researchers have recently identified biological mechanisms which distinguish individuals who are at risk for engaging in suicidal behavior, including low hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) and high levels of inflammatory biological markers. Biological mechanisms have high potential to partially explain suicidal behavior disparities between SMAs and non-SMAs, as individuals who experience bullying and childhood abuse are more likely to evidence biological dysregulation during adolescence and into adulthood. The proposed K01 study will examine how biological mechanisms (HCC and inflammatory markers) are associated with gay-related bullying, and how biological mechanisms predict clinical and neurocognitive correlates of suicidal behavior (suicidal ideation, impulsivity, and decision-making) among SMAs and non-SMAs. The proposed study will be the first in a program of research designed to facilitate more effective identification of SMAs at risk for suicidal behavior and identify psychosocial, biological, and neurocognitive factors which can be targeted within interventions designed to attenuate stark disparities in suicidal behavior between SMAs and non-SMAs.  To launch this program of research, the candidate will augment his prior training in social and behavioral determinants of SMA health with training in biological mechanisms of suicidal behavior, conducting longitudinal research and analyzing longitudinal data, and neurocognitive correlates of suicidal behavior. He has an ideal mentorship team within an optimal scientific training environment to undertake the proposed research and training plans. Primary Mentor Dr. Nadine Melhem has significant expertise in biological mechanisms of suicidal behavior and longitudinal research methods. Co-Mentor Dr. Michael Marshal is an expert on SMA mental health disparities, including suicidality. The candidate will also receive mentoring from internal Consultant Dr. Anna Marsland, a leading scholar in psychoneuroimmunology, internal Consultant Dr. Kehui Chen, a statistician with ongoing collaborations with Dr. Melhem, and external Consultant Dr. Jeffrey Bridge, who contributes expertise in neurocognitive risk for suicidal behavior among adolescents. Completion of the proposed research and training plans will position the candidate as a leading scholar in SMA suicidal behavior, preparing him to examine this pressing mental health disparity longitudinally across adolescence and at multiple levels of analysis. Project Narrative  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and sexual minority adolescents (SMAs) have extremely high rates of suicidality. The proposed study will be the first within a broader program of research to examine how biological mechanisms of suicidal behavior, including dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and chronic low-grade inflammation, contribute to disproportionate rates of suicidal behavior among SMAs. Knowledge gained from this research has the potential to attenuate alarming rates of suicidal behavior among SMAs by 1) facilitating more effective identification of SMAs at risk for suicidal behavior, and 2) identifying promising psychosocial, biological, and neurocognitive intervention targets to reduce suicidality within this vulnerable population.",Biological Mechanisms of Suicidal Behavior among Sexual Minority Adolescents,9898464,K01MH117142,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child Abuse ', ' Childhood Abuse ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gambling ', ' Hair ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interview ', ' Iowa ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Psychoneuroimmunology ', ' psychoneuroimmunological ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Shame ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Time ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' sex abuse ', ' sexually abused ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' Attenuated ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' bully ', ' bullying ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Marshal ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' HPA axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' physical abuse ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' suicide attempter ', ' suicidal youth ', ' suicidal adolescent ', ' demographics ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' reduce suicidality ', ' reduce suicide ', ' reducing suicidality ', ' reducing suicide ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' sexual minority ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Same-sex ', ' adolescent health ', ' recruit ', ' biological sex ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2020,168276,0.05040003779009624
"Psychosocial Problems, Positive Development, and Educational Outcomes Educational achievement remains a major public health crisis for black adolescents. Despite a reduction in racial gaps, black adolescents still experience disproportionate underachievement, higher retention and suspension rates, and a greater likelihood of attending resource poor or high poverty schools compared to many other racial or ethnic groups. These disparities place them at risk for lower quality of life, limited economic potential, and lower chances of functioning competently in a multifarious society. While some research details how psychosocial problems forecast negative educational trajectories for black adolescents, gaps remain in our understanding of factors that may mitigate the effect of psychosocial problems on youth educational success. Positive youth development and resiliency theories elucidate developmental assets as protective or promotive, contributing to better behavioral outcomes, reduced high-risk behaviors, and greater youth ability to achieve success in spite of adversity. Given the significance of youth-environment transactions, contextual factors (e.g., parent support) potentially underlie the development of assets. As well, higher levels of developmental assets have been linked to better educational outcomes and fewer psychosocial problems. To date, the majority of research has failed to acknowledge the significance of historical, cultural, and ethnic heritage for black adolescents' developmental outcomes and heterogeneity within samples of black youth. Concomitantly, there is scant research focused on gender and age differences in the positive youth development of black adolescents. This study uses nationally representative data from the National Survey of American Life-Adolescent (NSAL-A) to explore how developmental assets mediate and moderate associations between psychosocial problems and educational outcomes among African American and Caribbean black adolescents ages 13-17. The proposed research is a cost-effective method to test two aims consistent with NICHD's mission to ensure that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential and experience healthy and productive lives. Given established relations between psychosocial problems and educational outcomes, and between developmental assets and both psychosocial problems and educational success, study aims are: 1) Clarify the roles (i.e., mediating and/or moderating) that developmental assets have on the relation between psychosocial problems and educational outcomes, while examining influence of contextual factors on developmental assets; and 2) Examine if the influence of developmental assets on the relation between psychosocial problems and educational outcomes varies by cultural factors (ethnicity, racial socialization), gender, and age. Study findings will improve precision in identifying culturally relevant targets of interventions designed to promote better educational outcomes among black youth and address racial disparities in adolescent educational outcomes. Despite a reduction in racial gaps, educational achievement remains a major public health crisis for black adolescents. The proposed study explores how developmental assets mediate and moderate relations between psychosocial problems and educational outcomes among black youth, while considering the effect of contextual factors, and whether these relations vary by cultural factors (ethnicity, racial socialization), gender, and age group. Study findings will improve precision in identifying culturally relevant targets of interventions designed to promote better educational outcomes among black youth and address racial disparities in adolescent educational outcomes.","Psychosocial Problems, Positive Development, and Educational Outcomes",9978419,R03HD099390,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Economics ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Female ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Motivation ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' self esteem ', ' Socialization ', ' Societies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Suspensions ', ' Suspension substance ', ' Testing ', ' Underachievement ', ' Gender ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' teacher ', ' Fostering ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' black Caribbean ', ' black carib ', ' African Caribbean ', ' psychosocial ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Transact ', ' expectation ', ' high risk behavior ', ' age difference ', ' positive youth development ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Psychosocial Effect ', ' Treatment/Psychosocial Effects ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' peer support ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender difference ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R03,2020,98992,0.10864794926204951
"Prevention of Adolescent Risky Behaviors: Neural Markers of Intervention Effects Adolescence is a time of dramatic biological, behavioral and social changes. It is one of the healthiest periods of the life-span, yet morbidity and mortality rates increase 200%, often attributed to natural tendencies to explore and take risks that increase vulnerability to risky and dangerous behaviors. Rapid advances in developmental neuroscience are revealing new insights into how biology and social context interact to increase adolescents' risk-taking behavior which is attributed to a temporal disassociation between maturational changes in two distinct neural systems: “socio-emotional” (reward) and “cognitive-control” (self-regulation). The socio-emotional system is stimulated by a rapid increase in dopaminergic activity at puberty, which influences reward-seeking behavior. This increase in reward-seeking precedes the maturation of the cognitive-control system and its connections to the reward system. This proposal aims to apply these new insights on neurobiology of adolescents' responses to alcohol/drug use and sex-related risk opportunities by examining brain changes in response to a theoretically- based and empirically-tested prevention program that targets risky behavior in African-American youth during pubertal transition. This racial group is disproportionately affected by the high morbidity and mortality associated with HIV-related risky behaviors and exemplifies a significant health disparity in our society. The intervention was designed on the basis of developmental issues and socio-cultural contextual processes germane to African- American families, and has been shown in randomized controlled trials to delay/deter HIV-related risky behaviors in this vulnerable population. This proposal extends the efficacy studies of the intervention by using functional magnetic resonance imaging to quantify the biological changes in response to the intervention. Identifying neural substrates of the intervention can facilitate refinement of the program by focusing on the components that are most effective in changing behavioral and neural circuitry and also aid in the development of new interventions for subgroups of youth that don't have a positive outcome. Using a randomized controlled design, we will assess the neural substrates of risk-taking and risk-avoidant behavior before and after the 6-week computer-interactive, family-based intervention in 11-13 year-old African-American youth. Psychological processes shown to mediate the intervention effects on behaviors that dissuade alcohol and drug use and sexual onset (i.e. reward-drive and cognitive-emotional self-regulation) will be assessed at baseline and 3 months post-intervention. Based on prior studies that reported observable brain changes in response to psychosocial interventions, our hypothesis is that a positive response to the intervention will be associated with greater functional connectivity changes between the socio-emotional (reward-drive) and cognitive-control (self-regulation) components of the neural circuitry compared to the control condition, both at rest and during task-performance. We also postulate that these neural changes will mediate the intervention's positive effects on psychological processes involved in youth's decision to avoid HIV-risk vulnerability behaviors in the service of long-term personal goals and positive health outcomes. Adolescence is a time of biological and behavioral changes that can lead to risky and dangerous behaviors, and African-American youth are highly vulnerable to the consequences of risky behavior, including HIV/AIDS and violence, leading to premature death. We previously showed that an intervention program reduces HIV-risk vulnerability behaviors in many African-American youth. We aim to measure how the program affects different regions of the brain in order to better prevent or reduce such risky behaviors among African-American youth.",Prevention of Adolescent Risky Behaviors: Neural Markers of Intervention Effects,9914097,R01DA040966,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Computers ', ' Dangerous Behavior ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Family ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Sex and Race/Ethnicity-specific Multilevel Factors Influencing Pubertal Trajectories: a Population-based Study ABSTRACT Age of pubertal onset has declined dramatically in both girls and boys in the US, with substantial racial/ethnic disparities. This has important public health implications as early puberty is linked with a variety of detrimental adolescent behavioral and emotional outcomes as well as adult chronic diseases. In response to these trends, clinicians have adjusted by shifting the guidelines for the cutoff point for early puberty from age <8 to as early as age <6 in girls. To design effective interventions, we must first: (1) establish current normative trajectories for US adolescents by sex, race/ethnicity and BMI to reliably identify children who are going through puberty substantially earlier than their peers of the same racial/ethnic group, and (2) identify sex-specific modifiable risk factors that can serve as targets for intervention strategies in high-risk groups. Healthy People 2020 emphasizes the importance of improving adolescent health because puberty is an important window of susceptibility that impacts adolescent behaviors and adult morbidity. To address the lack of data on pubertal trajectories by racial/ethnic groups, described in PA-18-033, we will take advantage of the robust data for the racially/ethnically diverse population of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) to conduct the largest population-based, longitudinal study undertaken to date. Acknowledging the importance of screening for early puberty, KPNC began routine documentation of pediatrician-assessed Tanner stages in the electronic health record (EHR) in 2010, and we have since validated the quality of these data. We will use these pubertal development data, race/ethnicity, and pre-pubertal BMI data to efficiently characterize the sex- and race/ethnicity specific normative distributions of pubertal onset and tempo (rate of pubertal progression from onset to completion of maturation) in 170,000 boys and girls (Aim 1). We will then use data on a sub-cohort of boys and girls who were born at KPNC after the implementation of the EHR system (2006) to create a virtual birth cohort to investigate individual-level early life intervenable metabolic factors such as maternal pre- pregnancy obesity, gestational weight gain, and postnatal growth trajectory (Aim 2) as factors influencing pubertal timing. Lastly, we will link historical geocoded address data to the California Neighborhood Data System, which we developed, to investigate contextual factors (e.g., social and built environment) influencing pubertal timing (Aim 3). Our studies incorporate several innovations and strengths including the use of large and comprehensive EHR and a diverse population of boys and girls to conduct an otherwise costly longitudinal study, examination of several important hallmarks of puberty, and investigation of individual and contextual level factors as risk factors. Risk factors identified from this study and the role of sex and race/ethnicity will guide the design of upstream individual- as well as policy-level interventions. Such interventions targeting high risk groups will advance our long-term goal of preventing health disparities worsened by early puberty. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Early puberty has been found to increase the risk of depression and behavioral difficulties during adolescence, and of several chronic diseases in adulthood. Despite the observed trend toward earlier pubertal development in US adolescents, little is known about current normative pubertal timing among minorities or boys, nor modifiable risk factors that may influence timing of puberty, aside from childhood obesity. We will characterize normative distributions of pubertal timing in a large representative population so that clinicians can reliably identify children developing substantially earlier than their peers (Aim 1), and further, identify individual-level and neighborhood level factors that influence pubertal timing to inform the design of targeted strategies to prevent early puberty (Aims 2&3), with a long-term goal of reducing adolescent and adult risks of serious chronic diseases.",Sex and Race/Ethnicity-specific Multilevel Factors Influencing Pubertal Trajectories: a Population-based Study,9929618,R01HD098220,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adolescent Behavior ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Morbidity -

"Implementing mental health interventions for pregnant adolescents in primary care LMIC contexts SUMMARY High prevalence of adolescent pregnancies in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) has resulted in a tremendous public health burden. Many adolescent pregnancies are unwanted, unplanned, and outside of marriage. When adolescent girls become mothers, their opportunities for economic and educational growth are limited. A burgeoning number of adolescent mothers from LMICs are also marginalized due to poverty or gender-based traditions, which further limit their access to health resources, social protection/ support and personal development. Structural inequalities and adverse circumstances have resulted in high prevalence of depression in adolescent mothers. Despite the enormous mental health needs for adolescent mothers in LMICs, child and adolescent mental health service remains in its’ infancy. There is a need to advance cultural and context-sensitive perinatal depression interventions that can align with adolescents’ living contexts and developmental needs and simultaneously address multiple resource challenges in provision of mental health care in LMIC settings. This application seeks to respond to these adolescent perinatal depression intervention and implementation research gaps by i) utilizing WHO Mental Health Treatment Gap Action Program (mhGAP) and Group Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-G) depression care packages that has shown to be efficacious for adult depression, and further test the approaches in adolescents with perinatal depression in Kenyan maternal and child health (MCH) service settings. Three key research questions will be studied: (i) how to improve fit of the mhGAP/IPT-G-depression intervention model for pregnant adolescents in Kenya, (ii) how to effectively integrate task-shifting/sharing and collaborative strategies with MCH clinical workflow to implement mhGAP/IPT-G depression intervention for pregnant adolescents in MCH settings, and (iii) whether the adapted mhGAP/IPT-G are feasible-acceptable-effective in addressing perinatal depression in adolescents. Considering the demand-resource gap, as MCH clinics usually serve high volume of adolescents with perinatal depression but have limited resources, this study will also explore other cost-effective strategies, such as study feasibility of applying long and mini version of IPT-G and other family/adolescent peer co-lead approach of intervention implementation. This study will be carried out using a cross-disciplinary partnership approach. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) explore barriers and strategies to improve mhGAP-IG/IPT-G fit and implementation for adolescent perinatal depression in MCH clinics in Kenya; 2) Develop adapted version of IPT-G/ and mhGAP-IG, and build MCH capacity for implementation; and 3) test feasibility and implementation-effectiveness outcomes for the adapted version of mhGAP-IG/ IPT-G.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Pregnant adolescents in Sub-Saharan-African (SSA) are burdened by significant unmet health needs including lack of access to mental health services. This study seeks to enrich WHO’s mental health depression intervention with culturally and developmentally sensitive implementation strategies in primary care settings. This study aligns closely with the NIMH strategic plan, Kenya Vision 2030, UN SDGs, and WHO mhGAP framework, and its results will advance implementation research and yield need knowledge and tools for addressing similar global health gaps in other LMICs.",Implementing mental health interventions for pregnant adolescents in primary care LMIC contexts,9918481,K43TW010716,"['Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Community Developments ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Institutes ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Kenya ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Marriage ', ' Maternal-Child Health Services ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Tests ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Poverty ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' adolescents who are pregnant ', ' Unwanted pregnancy ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Gender ', ' Adolescent Health Services ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' mental health organization ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' adolescent mother ', ' teen mom ', ' teen mother ', ' teenage mom ', ' teenage mother ', ' African ', ' Social Protection ', ' Inequality ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' palpable disease ', ' Palpable ', ' Services ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' offspring ', ' research study ', ' pregnant adolescent ', ' teens who are pregnant ', ' pregnant teen ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' reproductive ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Health system ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' implementation research ', ' effectiveness research ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' child depression ', ' interpersonal psychotherapy ', ' interpersonal therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' 18 year old ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' vulnerable adolescent ', ' perinatal depression ', ' peripartum depression ', ' support tools ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' service gap ', ' Service setting ', ' service delivery ', ' Child Health ', ' implementation strategy ', ' perinatal phase ', ' perinatal period ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI,K43,2020,108000,0.01023598057586466
"Effectiveness of end-of-life strategies to improve pediatric health outcomes and reduce disparities in rural Appalachia Project Summary Rural Appalachia has struggled with health and healthcare access for more than a century. For children, lack of access to healthcare services starts at birth with limited prenatal care resources and continues to end of life with restricted access to pediatric hospice. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of expanding access to pediatric hospice care (concurrent care) to reduce rural/urban disparities in child and adolescent health outcomes (symptom management, care continuity, and costs). To do this, we will obtain, link, and analyze data from a variety of sources including 2011-2014 Medicaid data, U.S. Census, and hospice provider files. We will employ geographic information systems and comparative effectiveness data analytic methods, in which we will control for patient/family, hospice provider, and community characteristics. A unique aspect of our proposed study is the use of mapping techniques to visualize rural/urban disparities in access to pediatric hospice care in Appalachia. By examining these data, we will be able to assess impact of concurrent care on rural/urban disparities and health outcomes in a significantly underserved populations. As the health of children and adolescents continues to decline in the Appalachian region, this information is of major importance to clinicians, policy-makers, and families. This line of investigation is expected to ultimately improve the quality care for children, adolescents, and their families at end of life in Appalachia. Project Narrative This proposal directly addresses the public health concerns regarding quality of health care for underserved and vulnerable populations such as children and adolescents in rural Appalachia. Its results will represent one of the first initiatives to examine strategies to expand access to end-of-life care to improve health and reduce rural/urban disparities in Appalachia among children and adolescents.",Effectiveness of end-of-life strategies to improve pediatric health outcomes and reduce disparities in rural Appalachia,10221177,R56NR019444,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Anxiety ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Dyspnea ', ' Breathlessness ', ' Family ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' Mississippi ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Substance Withdrawal ', ' Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' New York ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Team Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' Prenatal care ', ' pregnancy care ', ' prenatal appointment ', ' prenatal checkup ', ' prenatal visit ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Health ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Urban Health ', ' Work ', ' Hospice Care ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Data Files ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Services ', ' Life Sanctities ', ' Respect for Life ', ' Sanctity of Life ', ' Value of Life ', ' care delivery ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' child adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obese children ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' cost ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' evidence base ', ' adolescent health outcomes ', ' child patients ', ' pediatric patients ', ' Data Analytics ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' urban disparity ', ' Medicaid services ', ' pediatric health outcomes ', ' Child Health ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Rural Appalachian ', ' Rural Appalachia ', ' rural health disparities ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R56,2020,293301,0.07316397443523491
"Preventing Alcohol and Other Drug Use and Violence among Latino Youth Preventing Alcohol and Other Drug Use and Violence among Latino Youth Project Summary/Abstract This K01 research and training award advances my long-term goal of developing interventions designed to target alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and violence among Latino adolescents in the United States. Adolescent AOD use and violence are profoundly interrelated as evidence clearly indicates that adolescent AOD users are more likely to enact violence and that both acute intoxication and chronic use are related to aggression. Moreover, results from prospective studies suggest that youth involvement in violence also predicts subsequent AOD use. Latino early adolescents (ages 11 to 14) are disproportionally at risk to use alcohol and take part in violent behavior. And yet, there remains a critical need for the development of readily-scalable, preventative interven- tions that target AOD use and violence among Latino youth. The proposed research plan focuses on adapting an empirically-supported AOD use intervention (keepin' it REAL [kiR]) to include a focus on violence and, in turn, testing the adapted preventative intervention to examine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects. The proposed multidisciplinary training plan is designed to assist me in developing the necessary skills to effectively function as an independent researcher and carry out high-impact translational research. Specifically, this will include training in the use of qualitative methods to inform the adaptation and development of interventions, the process of systematically adapting/developing interventions, and, finally, the testing of interventions and preven- tion outcomes research. My training plan is directly linked to the three study aims. In Aim 1, I will conduct focus group interviews designed to inform the adaptation of kiR to include a focus on violence prevention. In Aim 2, I will build upon this formative research by adapting kiR to incorporate a focus on youth violence and violence prevention. And, in Aim 3, I will lead a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which the adapted intervention is tested in order to assess the feasibility/acceptability of the adapted intervention and assess whether a signal of efficacy is present for AOD use and violence outcomes. The contribution of the proposed research is expected to be the development of a readily-scalable, multicomponent preventative intervention for AOD use and violence among Latino early adolescents that can be tested in a fully-powered RCT (R01). This study addresses a signif- icant gap in prevention science among a large and rapidly-growing minority group experiencing multiple, inter- related health disparities. Moreover, this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide me with the training, research experience, and preliminary data necessary to make the leap to independent investi- gator status. Such experience and training is foundational in my effort to build upon my prior research in ways that can translate into intervention research projects designed to yield real-world benefits. Preventing Alcohol and Other Drug Use and Violence among Latino Youth Project Narrative: Public Health Relevancy Latinos are disproportionally at risk to use alcohol and other drugs (AOD) and take part in violent behavior during the critical stage of early adolescence (ages 11 to 14). And yet, there remains a need for the development of readily-scalable, prevention programs designed to target both AOD use and violence among this large and rap- idly-growing population.

"Examining the Role of Sleep Disturbances in Contributing to Health Risk Behaviors and Cardiometabolic Outcomes in Urban Native American Youth Project Summary/Abstract The coronavirus pandemic poses unprecedented challenges for people across the lifespan, including youth, and are likely more pronounced for those who live with poverty and health inequities. American Indian/ Alaskan Natives (AI/ANs) are one of the highest risk racial/ ethnic groups for health disparities, and they are a particularly vulnerable group for adverse health and socioeconomic impacts of the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Only one prior study to date retrospectively assessed the long-term psychosocial impact of quarantine on youth and families following an infectious disease outbreak (H1N1 or SARS), and none have assessed the impact on youth in the midst of the pandemic. AI/AN adolescents experience disproportionately high rates of comorbidities known to exacerbate the negative effects of the novel coronavirus, including heart disease, diabetes, obesity, as well as behavioral health problems, including depression and alcohol and other drug (AOD) use problems, which may be exacerbated during stay-at-home orders. This application is being submitted in response to NOT MD-20-019 Notice of Special Interest: Competitive and Administrative Supplements for the Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Minority Health and Health Disparities. Our aims are as follows: Aim 1a. Using two waves of data (baseline and during the coronavirus pandemic), we will examine changes in individual (e.g., technology use), family (e.g., conflict and cohesion), community (e.g., sense of community), and cultural (e.g., engagement in cultural activities) risk and protective factors, and changes in sleep, risk-taking and mental health (depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD). Aim 1b: Using two waves of data, we will examine how changes in risk and protective factors influence changes in sleep, risk-taking behaviors, mental health. For example, we hypothesize that increases in food insecurity will be associated with greater increases in sleep problems, risk-taking behaviors and mental health problems, whereas increases in engagement in cultural activities will be associated with better outcomes. Aim 2. Using the newly added COVID-19 specific questions, we will examine the association between COVID-19 related knowledge, risk perception, and behavioral responses, and challenges related to COVID-19 public health measures (e.g., being affected by school closings) and sleep, risk-taking behaviors, and mental health. Aim 3. Randomly select a subsample (N=25) of adolescents and administer qualitative interviews to examine how the coronavirus outbreak has affected AI/AN adolescent sleep habits, routines, and behaviors. This study will facilitate better understanding of how to plan support services and prevention measures for this underserved group of adolescents. Our findings will also move the field forward as this is the only study of sleep health in the context of the coronavirus among urban AI/AN youth. Project Narrative American Indian/Alaskan Natives (AI/ANs) are one of the highest risk racial/ ethnic groups for health disparities, and they are particularly vulnerable for adverse health and socioeconomic impacts of the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). AI/AN adolescents experience disproportionately high rates of comorbidities known to exacerbate the negative effects of the novel coronavirus, including heart disease, diabetes, obesity, as well as behavioral health problems, which may be exacerbated during stay-at-home orders. Using a mix of survey and in-depth interview data, the current supplement study will fill several critical gaps in the knowledge base with substantial implications for public health support services

"Prevention of Adolescent Risky Behaviors: Neural Markers of Intervention Effects Adolescence is a time of dramatic biological, behavioral and social changes. It is one of the healthiest periods of the life-span, yet morbidity and mortality rates increase 200%, often attributed to natural tendencies to explore and take risks that increase vulnerability to risky and dangerous behaviors. Rapid advances in developmental neuroscience are revealing new insights into how biology and social context interact to increase adolescents' risk-taking behavior which is attributed to a temporal disassociation between maturational changes in two distinct neural systems: “socio-emotional” (reward) and “cognitive-control” (self-regulation). The socio-emotional system is stimulated by a rapid increase in dopaminergic activity at puberty, which influences reward-seeking behavior. This increase in reward-seeking precedes the maturation of the cognitive-control system and its connections to the reward system. This proposal aims to apply these new insights on neurobiology of adolescents' responses to alcohol/drug use and sex-related risk opportunities by examining brain changes in response to a theoretically- based and empirically-tested prevention program that targets risky behavior in African-American youth during pubertal transition. This racial group is disproportionately affected by the high morbidity and mortality associated with HIV-related risky behaviors and exemplifies a significant health disparity in our society. The intervention was designed on the basis of developmental issues and socio-cultural contextual processes germane to African- American families, and has been shown in randomized controlled trials to delay/deter HIV-related risky behaviors in this vulnerable population. This proposal extends the efficacy studies of the intervention by using functional magnetic resonance imaging to quantify the biological changes in response to the intervention. Identifying neural substrates of the intervention can facilitate refinement of the program by focusing on the components that are most effective in changing behavioral and neural circuitry and also aid in the development of new interventions for subgroups of youth that don't have a positive outcome. Using a randomized controlled design, we will assess the neural substrates of risk-taking and risk-avoidant behavior before and after the 6-week computer-interactive, family-based intervention in 11-13 year-old African-American youth. Psychological processes shown to mediate the intervention effects on behaviors that dissuade alcohol and drug use and sexual onset (i.e. reward-drive and cognitive-emotional self-regulation) will be assessed at baseline and 3 months post-intervention. Based on prior studies that reported observable brain changes in response to psychosocial interventions, our hypothesis is that a positive response to the intervention will be associated with greater functional connectivity changes between the socio-emotional (reward-drive) and cognitive-control (self-regulation) components of the neural circuitry compared to the control condition, both at rest and during task-performance. We also postulate that these neural changes will mediate the intervention's positive effects on psychological processes involved in youth's decision to avoid HIV-risk vulnerability behaviors in the service of long-term personal goals and positive health outcomes. Adolescence is a time of biological and behavioral changes that can lead to risky and dangerous behaviors, and African-American youth are highly vulnerable to the consequences of risky behavior, including HIV/AIDS and violence, leading to premature death. We previously showed that an intervention program reduces HIV-risk vulnerability behaviors in many African-American youth. We aim to measure how the program affects different regions of the brain in order to better prevent or reduce such risky behaviors among African-American youth.",Prevention of Adolescent Risky Behaviors: Neural Markers of Intervention Effects,10116596,R01DA040966,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Computers ', ' Dangerous Behavior ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Family ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"A culturally centered CBT protocol for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among Latinx youth Project Summary The overall goal of this research program is to provide effective culturally relevant care to Latin families, and address the NIMHD mission of reducing disparities in underserved and minority populations. Evidence-based and culturally centered treatments for Latinx teens (Latinx = gender inclusive term) with suicidal ideation and attempts (SIA) and their families are quite limited. Emerging evidence indicate that Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a promising treatment approach in reducing suicidal ideation and attempts in Non-Latinx White adolescents. However, culturally adapted treatments have been shown to benefit Latin families more that non-culturally adapted treatments. This study is innovative in its use of a culturally centered CBT treatment protocol (Socio-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Suicidal Behavior-SCBT-SB) to address the specific needs of Latinx teens and their families. The SCBT-SB addresses central issues in adolescent identity formation (e.g. ethnicity, sexual orientation), family interactions and communication, and parenting skills. The SCBT-SB was developed with Latinx youth with SIA in Puerto Rico and further modified for Latin families in the US. Feasibility of this modified version of the SCBT-SB was tested in the US by conducting a pilot RCT (n=46) of SCBT vs treatment-as-usual (TAU) with positive results. It was found that SCBT-SB was feasible to implement in a community mental health center with frontline therapists, acceptable to families, and showed reductions in suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms. The scientific premise of the proposed study is that immigration and acculturation (the process of assimilation to the host culture) and enculturation (maintaining cultural values and costumes) experiences have an impact on SIA in Latinx teens; and that personalization of an evidence- based treatment, according to cultural and immigration experiences, will result in better treatment outcomes than TAU. This application proposes a hybrid efficacy/effectiveness trial with 160 suicidal Latinx teens randomly assigned, following baseline assessment, to 2 treatment conditions, TAU and SCBT-SB. Follow-up assessment will take place at 3, 6 and 12 months after baseline. All treatment will take place at a community mental health clinic. The specific aims are: 1) To test the effect of the SCBT-SB versus TAU on suicidal ideation in a clinical sample of adolescents under conditions of strong external validity, and 2) To test the effect of the SCBT-SB versus TAU on depressive symptoms, given its high correlation with SIA. Exploratory aims are: 3) To examine the effect of SCBT-SB versus TAU on suicide attempts, and 4) To examine potential mediators (family environment) of treatment outcome.

"The Impact of Stress and Resilience on Obesity-related Metabolic Complications in Adolescents PROJECT SUMMARY Rates of obesity are high in adolescents, with these youth at greater risk for developing metabolic complications than their lean peers. Poor metabolic function is associated with worse health outcomes, higher health care costs, and other health comorbidities; however, not all youth with obesity develop metabolic complications. Black youth have fewer metabolic complications compared to White youth, despite having among the highest rates of obesity. Understanding unique protective factors that slow the progression to poor metabolic health is necessary for reducing adverse health outcomes and improving the quality of life of adolescents with obesity. Thus, the specific aims of the proposed research are: 1) to examine differences in weight- and race-based stigma between Black adolescents who have obesity without metabolic complications (OMC-) and matched Black adolescents who have obesity with at least 2 metabolic complications (OMC2+); 2) to evaluate differences in physiological stress and psychological stress between OMC- and OMC2+ adolescents; and 3) to explore differences in resilience between OMC- and OMC2+ adolescents. We will use a case-control cross-sectional design to conduct 100 interviewer-administered surveys with caregivers and Black adolescents with and without metabolic complications in the US Midsouth. We will examine two groups of Black youth (aged 11-17) with obesity (defined as having a waist circumference ≥90th percentile). The OMC- group will include 50 adolescents with obesity who have optimal levels of blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, and liver function. The OMC2+ group will include 50 adolescents with obesity who have two or more metabolic complications (i.e., high blood pressure, elevated triglycerides, low high density lipoprotein (HDL), insulin resistance, and/or impaired liver function) matched to OMC- youth by age and sex. Quantitative surveys will examine caregiver and youth reports of weight- and race-based stigma, psychological stress, and resilience. Physiological stress will be assessed via salivary cortisol (diurnal and awakening response). We will obtain data on metabolic function including: blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and liver function. Given known associations with study outcome variables, we will obtain measures of income, physical/mental health, and dietary intake, and as well as measures of physical activity and sleep patterns via actigraphy. This innovative study will contribute to the field's understanding of why some Black youth are not yet exhibiting metabolic complications while others are. While genetic factors may account for ~27% of these variations, biopsychosocial factors have been underexplored. Thus, by studying this rare group of OMC- adolescents, we will obtain data on mutable factors that are relevant to a community most impacted by obesity. Knowledge gained will serve as pilot data for an R01 grant to develop a strength-based, culturally-informed intervention aimed at decreasing health disparities and maintaining metabolic health among Black youth with obesity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past 30 years, soaring rates of adolescent obesity have become a major public health concern, with many, but not all, of these youth developing metabolic complications. By studying risk and resilience among Black adolescents who have obesity without metabolic complications, we will understand why some youth are able to maintain this lower risk state; thus providing knowledge about modifiable factors that could alter the progression to poor metabolic health. We aim to study differences in physiological stress, psychological stress, weight-based stigma, race-based stigma, and resilience between Black youth with and Black youth without obesity-related metabolic complications; with findings poised to inform the development of strength-based interventions for reducing health disparities and promoting metabolic health among adolescents.",The Impact of Stress and Resilience on Obesity-related Metabolic Complications in Adolescents,10018865,R21DK113344,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fatty Liver ', ' Liver Steatosis ', ' hepatic steatosis ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Hypertriglyceridemia ', ' Hyperglyceridemia ', ' Raised TG ', ' Raised triglycerides ', ' elevated tg ', ' elevated triglyceride ', ' high triglycerides ', ' increased triglycerides ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Interviewer ', ' High Density Lipoproteins ', ' HDL ', ' HDL Lipoproteins ', ' Heavy Lipoproteins ', ' High density lipoprotein ', ' alpha-Lipoproteins ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Sleep ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Triglycerides ', ' Triacylglycerol ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' wt gain ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Physical activity ', ' liver function ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' impaired glucose tolerance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Body fat ', ' Knowledge ', ' Salivary ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' waist circumference ', ' psychosocial ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' case control ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Data ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' liver inflammation ', ' ANCOVA ', ' Analysis of Covariance ', ' metabolic rate ', ' adolescent health ', ' obese adolescents ', ' obesity among adolescents ', ' obesity during adolescence ', ' obesity in adolescence ', ' obesity in adolescents ', ' youth adiposity ', ' Adolescent obesity ', ' protective factors ', ' sleep pattern ', ' ']",NIDDK,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,178033,0.06499806260439236
"Hormones, Immunity and HIV Risk ABSTRACT Our over arching goal of this application is to determine if exogenous progestins used in long acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) will enhance adolescent risk for mucosal HIV acquisition. In the U.S., persons aged 13-24 years accounted for 26% of all new HIV infections. The HIV epidemic in adolescent girls reflects the strong combined impact of gender and income inequality, early sexual debut, age disparate sexual relationships, psychosexual maturation, sociocultural context, and heightened biological vulnerability. Exogenous progestins, expecially medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), have been epidemiologically linked to greater HIV acquisition. Gaps remain in our understanding of biological factors that might be associated with increased risk of HIV acqusition in adolescent girls and how exogenous progestins will influence this risk. LARCs use is encouraged for all women desiring to not become pregnant as they release progestins over 3 to 5 years. Typical LARCs include etonogestrel implants (ENG-I) or levonorgestrel-intrauterine system (LNG- IUS). Our preliminary data shows cervical tissue collected from women using MPA and LNG-IUS for contraception replicates HIV 2- to 3.5-fold higher than cervical tissue from non-contracepting women. Therefore, our aims center on potential genital tract differences non-contracepting and contracepting (ENG-I and LNG-IUS) 120 adolescents (18 to 19 years old) and correlate our findings to non-contracepting and contracepting 90 adult women (≥25 years old). First, differences in the capcity of cerivcal tissue to replicate HIV will be assess between the groups and associated with resident cell populations. Secondly, the vaginal fluid and epithelium, which provide the first line of defense against pathogens, including HIV, will be systematically studied. Vaginal fluid will be characterized for the microflora and the soluble mucosal proteins using an unbiased proteomic approach. These results will be correlated to functional activity of the luminal fluid as measured by in vitro anti-HIV activity. Our premise is that non-contracepting adolescent women will demonstrate higher levels of mediators and activated immune cells that are associated with increased HIV infection compared to more mature women. However, contracepting adolescent and adult women will have comparable levels of the mediators, activated immune cells, and capacity of tissue to replicate HIV. A key challenge will be the recruitment of adolescent girls. Our advantage is that adolescents frequent the outpatient clinic at Magee Womens Hospital and our clinical team has worked with adolescents in other studies, which overcomes many of the recruitment challenges. We have close working relationships among the groups represented in this application and have optimized specimen handling/processing/testing which is key for reproducibility in our work. This application will uniquely associate quantified analyses with functional outcomes and begin to address if exogenous progestins impose additional risk of HIV acquisition to young women. NARRATIVE Young women make up 20% of incident HIV infections in the U.S. and long acting reversible contraception is provided to reduce pregnancies. We lack information on biological factors in young girls that make them susceptible to HIV infection and if the contraception provided increases their risk in acquiring HIV. This application will help fill this gap by determining if the contraceptive hormones negatively modify those biological factors with the goal of improving the health of next generation.","Hormones,

"Sharing the burden of discrimination: Parents as sources of resilience from adolescent obesity-related health risk Abstract Research Project: African American (AA) and Hispanic/Latina (HL) female adolescents show markedly elevated rates of obesity compared to their Non-Hispanic White (NHW) and male peers. Minority and female youth also experience increased discrimination-related stress; stress-induced alterations to physiology and behavior may partially account for these disparities in obesity prevalence. Guided by attachment theory, an influential paradigm that has never before been applied to the study of obesity-related health disparities, this project takes a resilience-focused approach, proposing that parents can buffer the impact of discrimination on youth. When parents serve as a safe haven (SH), providing comfort when youth face threat, and a secure base (SB), encouraging youth to actively cope with stressors in the environment, they help to strengthen youth’s ability to withstand discrimination with less physiological wear and tear. Attachment theory proposes that SH/SB can be measured both behaviorally and physiologically, as SH/SB exchanges affect both parent and youth Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity. Participants include 120 female adolescents (1/3 AA, 1/3 HL, 1/3 NHW; 1/3 obese, 1/3 overweight, 1/3 typical weight) and their caregivers, enrolled in an R01 study of adolescent stress and obesity-related health parameters (body composition, physiology, energy balance, and cardio-metabolic markers). Attachment relationships are measured during parent-youth discussions of youth experiences of discrimination. Both parent SH/SB behavior and parent-youth ANS activity linkage are assessed as indices of attachment. The study’s first aim tests whether associations between youth discrimination and obesity-related health are moderated by a) coded SH/SB or b) parent-youth ANS linkage. The second aim identifies catalysts of this health-protective parenting (SH/SB and physiology) for parents who have been exposed to discrimination. Parents’ history of discrimination may either reduce or enhance their sensitive responses to youth’s experiences of discrimination, depending on the parent’s capacity for reflective functioning, the ability to attune to youth’s thoughts, emotions, and intentions. The proposed study adds parent-youth discrimination discussions to an existing, data-rich study of adolescent obesity disparities. By identifying attachment relationships as reducing the obesogenic effect of discrimination, this project lays the foundation for the future development of dyadic obesity interventions for at-risk minority youth. Training Plan and Environment: Post-doctoral training will launch PI Kazmierski’s research career as a clinical psychologist who studies social determinants of health for at-risk youth. Via research, coursework, mentorship, and professional development activities, the proposed fellowship will endow Ms. Kazmierski with increased mastery of the theories, methodologies, and statistical approaches used in health disparities research. Working with Drs. Rao, Borelli, and their collaborators at UC Irvine provides a resource- and mentorship-rich environment to scaffold Ms. Kazmierski’s academic and professional development. Project Narrative Public Health Relevance: Ethnic/racial disparities in adolescent obesity portend cascades of health risk throughout the lifespan, putting AA and HL women at increased risk for heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. The proposed study takes a resilience-focused approach, proposing that parent-youth attachment relationships buffer the obesogenic effects of discrimination.

"Health and Psychosocial Need: The Ascenze study of risk and protection in adolescence South Africa (SA) has the largest HIV epidemic globally, and is simultaneously affected by poverty, inequality, violence and other legacies of Apartheid. Children growing up in disadvantaged communities affected by HIV are at high risk for cognitive, behavioral, health and educational problems that, in turn, increase their risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV. This study has the long-term goal of halting the devastation of the HIV epidemic by intervening to promote better cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial functioning of adolescents in SA. We will use a socio-ecological model with a life course perspective to prospectively investigate factors linked to drug use, binge drinking and unprotected sex including adolescent attributes such as executive function, and past and current family and contextual factors.  The population-based Asenze cohort of 4-6 year old children and their primary caregiver, funded through R01 DA023697, will form the study sample. They reside in five disadvantaged areas in KwaZulu-Natal. The children, born between 2004 and 2006, were previously assessed at two time points on cognitive, bio- medical, and psychosocial functioning and their caregivers were interviewed about caregiver HIV, mental health, substance use, stress, support, household assets and household substance use. Over 25% of caregivers were HIV+; 9% reported binge drinking, 31% screened positive for a psychiatric disorder, over 30% had experienced partner violence and 17% reported that someone in the household had a drinking problem. Only 9% of households contained an adult who had completed secondary school.  The Asenze cohort, reaching adolescence between 2017-2019, provides a unique opportunity to investigate the early-life origins of adolescent risk behavior in a disadvantaged population while building a strong foundation for later investigations into adulthood. We will investigate the pathways through which adolescent executive function and impulsivity, interact with both early and current social context (including their family adversity, disorganization and support as well as the behavior of their friends) affect the initiation of risky behaviors (drug use, binge drinking and unprotected sex). We will link the childhood cohort assessments of development and early adversity to those to be collected in both early and mid adolescence, including cognitive development, executive function and the initiation of risky behaviors. The findings will be crucial for informing critical prevention programs to halt the spread of HIV and promote healthy adolescent functioning.  We will build research capacity through mentoring and training emerging South African scientists, masters, doctoral and post-doctoral students to build research expertise focused on investigating the impact of adolescent neurocognitive development on the initiation of risky behaviors, which result in negative education and sexual health outcomes, including HIV infection. We will also develop a SA research network of investigators working with cohort studies to promote their use in neuroscience and mental health outcomes.   Leslie Davidson and Chris Desmond, co-PIs Narrative: Health and Psychosocial Need: Being submitted to Fogarty in response to PAR 14-332 The Asenze study of adolescent risk and protection will investigate how early and current family and social strengths and difficulties impact the adoption by South African teenagers of risky behaviors (drug use, binge drinking, unprotected sex), behaviors that will sharply increase their chances of HIV infection and other negative outcomes such as school failure or adolescent pregnancy. We will measure their ability to think things through, to plan and to resist impulses, abilities that will affect whether or not they engage in risky behaviors. Because we will follow-up 1581 children whom we have already assessed twice in childhood, we know a great deal about them, their childhood experiences and family life and this information will be extremely useful in developing interventions to prevent harmful behaviors and to protect adolescents from becoming part of an ongoing HIV epidemic.",Health and Psychosocial Need: The Ascenze study of

"Achieving American Indian Youth Energy and Mental Health Balance PROJECT SUMMARY American Indian (AI) youth have the highest prevalence of obesity of all ethnic groups in the United States, placing them at disproportionate risk for adult obesity and obesity-driven metabolic disease including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, stroke, and cancer. In fact, greater than 41.7% of the children and adolescents from the Hopi Tribe, Pascua Yaqui Tribe, Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, and the Yavapai Apache Nation—tribal communities collaborating in the proposed study—are obese. Health behaviors can modify obesity risk and associated morbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. To enhance the impact of our efforts, we recognize the intervention must include parental support and attention to emotional well-being and coping skills through the integration of mind-body medicine (MBM). The goal of the Achieving American Indian Youth Energy and Mental Health Balance (AYEM-B) Study is to develop and test a culturally-relevant, community-led intervention that incorporates the principles of MBM skills training and parental /caregiver engagement to support AI youth in achieving healthy lifestyle choices and in reducing risk for adult obesity and related metabolic diseases.  Our hypothesis is that participation in a community-led intervention that includes MBM and the family will reduce obesity-related chronic disease risk factors in AI adolescents (n=224), as assessed by changes in body mass index z-score (primary outcome) and the objective measures of moderate/vigorous physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake (secondary outcomes) at 6 months. We will test our hypothesis by addressing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Integrate an existing week-long residential wellness camp program for AI adolescents with novel MBM and parental engagement components to establish a 6-month community-led obesity prevention intervention for AI adolescents (aged 10–15 years) and their parents/caregivers. Specific Aim 2: Assess the preliminary efficacy of the newly established program on body mass index z-score, physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake in American Indian adolescents at baseline, 3 and 6 months using a within-subjects design. Also, evaluate changes in individual risk factors (lipids, hemoglobin A1C, fasting glucose) pre- and post-intervention. Specific Aim 3: Evaluate indicators of successful program implementation and the potential for sustainability across participating tribal communities, including acceptability and relevance to participants, parents, and the community, and program adoption, feasibility, fidelity, and costs. NARRATIVE American Indian youth have the highest prevalence of obesity of all ethnic groups in the United States. Health behaviors can modify obesity risk and associated morbidity.

"Implementing a church-based parenting intervention to promote NIDA prevention science among Hispanics PROJECT SUMMARY Hispanic populations in the United States (US) continue to be seriously impacted by persistent health disparities. According to the 2017 Monitoring the Future Study, Hispanic adolescents had the highest rates of use of most illicit drugs compared to other ethnic groups. When considering differential risks among Hispanics, US-born youth in low-income first-generation immigrant families are at high risk for experiencing poverty, discrimination, and barriers to access services. These adolescents can also be exposed to deleterious parent- youth cultural conflicts, which may increase their risk for behavioral problems, including the use of alcohol and other drugs. Contextual stressors also have a negative impact on the quality of parenting practices of immigrant parents, with associated deleterious consequences for their adolescent children. Although parent training (PT) interventions constitute the gold standard for strengthening parenting practices that are effective protective factors in the lives of adolescents, the availability of efficacious culturally adapted PT interventions in underserved Hispanic communities remains scarce throughout the US. Thus, there is an urgent need in the implementation science (IS) field to identify implementation strategies aimed at addressing service gaps affecting Hispanic populations. A promising alternative consists of relying on third sector organizations, such as faith-based organizations, to integrate prevention programs in underserved communities. The current R34 investigation will consist of the implementation and modest refinements of a culturally adapted version of the evidence-based PT intervention known as GenerationPMTO.© Our rationale is that implementing efficacious prevention interventions in faith-based organizations constitutes a key alternative to address service barriers experienced by underserved populations. We also propose that by training lay members of target communities as prevention interventionists, the sustainment of prevention programs can be significantly enhanced. This study has relevance as we focus on a population that remains understudied in the IS field. Our research team is composed of the largest faith-based organization serving Hispanics in Travis County, Texas, as well as a core research team affiliated with the University of Texas at Austin, expert IS consultants, and community- based organizations serving Hispanic populations. The research aims of this R34 investigation are: (a) To implement a pilot study aimed at refining the CAPAS-Youth curriculum and study procedures, (b) to implement a randomized controlled trial, aimed at empirically testing the efficacy of the CAPAS-Youth intervention with first-generation low-income Hispanic families in Travis County, (c) to measure barriers and facilitators associated with the implementation of the CAPAS-Youth prevention intervention in the target context, and (d) to measure relevant implementation outcomes to inform a future R01 effectiveness trial. The investigation has high  PROJECT NARRATIVE Hispanic young adolescents are at a disproportionate high risk for cigarette use, alcohol use, and use of the majority of illicit substances. Furthermore, low-income Hispanic families experience significant barriers to engage in efficacious culturally adapted prevention interventions. By proposing an investigation aimed at testing a prevention implementation approach with undeserved Hispanic families, the proposed R34 study is directly responsive to NIH and NIDA strategic goals focused on reducing health disparities and increasing the public health impact of NIDA research.",Implementing a church-based parenting intervention to promote NIDA prevention science among Hispanics,9949246,R34DA050782,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Drug Compounding ', ' Drug Preparation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Michigan ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Uninsured ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Services ', ' Church ', ' experience ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' stressor ', ' austin ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Prevention Services Research ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' prevent alcohol ', ' preventing alcohol ', ' alcohol prevention ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Prevention trial ', ' Data Analytics ', ' service gap ', ' protective factors ', ' implementation strategy ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R34,2020,197471,0.054152907067379866
"Fragile Families Summer Data Training Workshop Series 2021-2025 ABSTRACT This proposal seeks funds for a series of five summer workshops that will train a diverse group of early-career scholars on the use of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFS), a population-based, longitudinal, NIH-funded birth cohort survey developed to further understanding of the social and behavioral factors affecting the development of urban children. Compared with children born to married, college-educated parents, children born to unmarried parents, who lack a college education, often referred to as “fragile families,” are much more likely to grow up in poor, high crime and violent neighborhoods and to attend schools with other poor children. Biomedical and population scientists have raised a multitude of questions about the extent to which such environmental factors affect child and adolescent wellbeing, the extent to which they may moderate the genetic predispositions of children and adolescents toward health or behavioral challenges, and the mechanisms that govern any causal effects. The FFS has played an important role in addressing these questions; however, much remains to be learned, and the collection of new contextual and genetic FFS data stands to further advance the research literature. As such, the proposed workshops will each focus on a thematic area relevant to the above-mentioned concerns and will discuss different aspects of the FFS data not covered in prior training workshops, including adolescent sleep, health behavior relationships; cognitive development; DNA methylation ; brain development; criminal justice involvement; and outcomes for children when they are 22 years old. The proposed series of workshops will train a new generation of researchers from a variety of disciplines in the social and biomedical sciences on the capabilities of the FFS data and will result in the dissemination of the Fragile Families data, an improved understanding of the issues facing adolescents and young adults in fragile families, and opportunities for mentorship and collaboration for a new generation of social, behavioral, and biomedical scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal seeks funds to develop and operate a 5-year series of summer workshops to train a diverse group of early-career scholars on the use of data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. The workshops will present substantive findings from the data, discuss the measurement of key constructs for population research, and provide hands-on training with the Fragile Families data. In so doing, the proposed workshop will support a cohort of emerging scholars and further the understanding of behavioral and social functioning relevant to the health and wellbeing of adolescents and families.",Fragile Families Summer Data Training Workshop Series 2021-2025,9937204,R25HD074544,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Book Chapters ', ' Books ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' child well being ', ' child wellbeing ', ' Cities ', ' Couples ', ' Crime ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Paper ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Play ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saliva ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Urban Developments ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Unmarried ', ' career ', ' child physical development ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' journal article ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' tool ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Scientist ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Feels well ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' psychological wellness ', ' self wellness ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' Well in self ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' interest ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' Performance ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' family genetics ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Collection ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparator group ', ' comparison group ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 15 years of age ', ' age 15 years ', ' fifteen year old ', ' fifteen years of age ', ' 15 year old ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' population based ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' genetic make-up ', ' genetic makeup ', ' cognitive development ', ' full professor ', ' senior faculty ', ' adolescent health ', ' urban children ', ' racial minority ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' data access ', ' sleep hygiene ', ' sleep health ', ' ']",NICHD,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R25,2020,161460,0.03729454427659043
"Engaging providers, community members, and young women to adapt and pilot a youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health package in low-income communities in India Project summary/abstract  Impoverished adolescent girls and young women (ages 15-25 years) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face inequitable gender norms that limit their educational opportunities, social support, and healthcare access. These inequities also place them at higher risk for maternal morbidity and mortality, psychological trauma, violence, and STIs/HIV. Consistent with these patterns, many young women in India marry early and face similar sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) challenges.  Adolescent services in India are unequally distributed leaving marginalized adolescents, including those not in school, without services or access. In 2013, India launched the “Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakam” (National Adolescent Health Program) framework for improved adolescent health services and education to be provided in the healthcare system and community through adolescent health clubs and adolescent-friendly health clinics. However, implementation of the framework has been uneven, with poor fidelity in the adaptation of programs to make them youth-centered.  In this proposal, I will adapt and pilot an integrated community and facility intervention to improve uptake of adolescent-friendly services for married and unmarried AGYW (ages 15-25) in a low-income area with a population of 600,000 in Mumbai, India. Formative research will characterize the SRHR landscape in the study area and adapt the intervention using the systematic ADAPT-ITT approach. The community component will adapt a health curriculum for the peer adolescent health clubs to incorporate participatory activities to build AGYW’s resources and agency, promote use of newly available adolescent services, and obtain participants’ viewpoints and preferences. The facility component consists of adapted sensitization training on adolescent- friendly care for health providers and staff at both public and private clinics in the study area. This hybrid pilot study will assess both implementation outcomes and a pilot set of health/behavioral outcomes including clinic service uptake, contraceptive use, mental health, gender norms/agency, and health knowledge.  My longstanding commitment to global health research with adolescent girls and young women has led me to pursue training opportunities to gain experience in international collaborative research projects. This K award builds on my doctoral and post-doctoral training in medical anthropology and adolescent SRHR, and the relationships I have developed with multidisciplinary mentors and organizations in the United States and Mumbai, India. This proposal extends my previous training and K12 work on youth-centered approaches to SRHR communication in the U.S. by providing training in adolescent health quality improvement, implementation science, and advanced quantitative methods in an international context. This K01 award also facilitates my development into an independent global health researcher focused on improving adolescent girls’ health and well-being in low-income communities. Project Narrative Adolescent girls and young women in low- and middle-income countries such as India, face unique challenges including early marriage, maternal morbidity and mortality, violence, psychological trauma, increased STI/HIV risk, and limited access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information or services. Implementation of India’s adolescent health framework has been uneven and limited in low-income communities. This proposal will use the ADAPT-ITT approach to systematically adapt an integrated community/facility intervention to improve uptake of adolescent-friendly services for married and unmarried adolescent girls and young women (ages 15-25 years), followed by a quasi-experimental hybrid pilot study that will use mixed methods to assess both implementation outcomes and health/behavioral outcomes including clinic service uptake, contraceptive use, mental health, gender norms/agency, and health knowledge in an urban low-income area in Mumbai, India.","Engaging providers, community

"A randomized controlled trial of Friends of the Children, a long-term professional mentoring program for adolescents at risk: impacts at post-test and 2 year follow-up Abstract  This proposal seeks funding to examine the impact of a 12.5-year long, relationship-based, professional mentoring program, Friends of the Children (FOTC) within the context of an existing multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT; FOTC versus control). The research trial (The Child Study) was funded by the NIH through the NICHD from 2007-2013. The program has continued through a variety of external funders. Professional mentors (called “Friends”) have continued working with the youth since the project began. Mentors receive extensive training and apprenticeship, and then participate in ongoing supervision, working with a typical caseload of 8 children during elementary school and 10-12 youth during middle and high school. Across the course of the program, youth involved in the program have interacted both with their mentors and with other youth-mentor pairs, becoming part of a community of children and adolescents and caring adults.  To the best of our knowledge, there are no published, rigorous outcome studies of a mentoring program that has this combination of program elements. The study is built on the rigorous research program that began during The Child Study (Eddy, et al. 2015, Eddy et al., 2017), which demonstrated the strong adoption and implementation of the FOTC mentoring model. Further, 5 years after the program began, this study found growth in parent’s report of the youth’s behavioral strengths, as measured by increased family involvement, interpersonal strengths and school functioning; positive school behavior; and less externalizing problem behavior in youth randomized to FOTC compared to controls. The proposed study will reengage participants in both intervention and control conditions to conduct end-line (just after actual or estimated high school graduation) and 2-year follow-up evaluations of program impact into young adulthood.  The study uses a rigorous RCT design that includes two assessments of all of the active participants in The Child Study (N = 259), a sample of low income, ethnically diverse, at-risk, urban youth. Data will also be collected from caregivers and school, arrest and court records will be collected at the end point. Implementation data collected by FOTC will also be used in the analysis. Young adult surveys will be conducted and arrest and court records collection at the 2-year follow-up (about age 21). Using intent-to-treat analyses, this study will examine program impacts in 3 primary outcomes -- avoidance of involvement in juvenile justice, graduation from high school or obtaining a GED, and delaying parenthood into young adulthood, at the program end point and 2 years later. Further, we will explore whether hypothesized mechanisms of increased social capital mediates the relationships between intervention and outcomes. Finally, we will examine the relationship between various levels of program involvement in FOTC and program impact. Public Health Impact Preventing high school dropout, juvenile justice involvement, and early parenthood for those youth most at risk within urban environments is challenging. Experimentally testing the impact of a long-term professional mentoring program in a randomized controlled trial on these three outcomes can inform us of the impacts of such programs. Should this approach demonstrate strong evidence related to these outcomes, mentoring programs such as Friends of the Children may play an important preventive role reducing health disparities among “high-risk” individuals and their communities.","A randomized controlled trial of Friends of the Children, a long-term professional mentoring program for adolescents at risk: impacts at post-test and 2 year follow-up",9970947,R01HD099118,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Boston ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Justice ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mentors ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Oregon ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Play ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Privatization ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Student Dropouts ', ' School Dropouts ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wood material ', ' Wood ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' court ', ' dosage ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' Outcome Study ', ' interest ', ' 1st grade ', ' first grade ', ' Services ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Participant ', ' deviancy ', ' deviant ', ' Reporting ', ' antisocial ', ' anti social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' junior high ', ' middle school ', ' junior high school ', ' kindergarten ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' juvenile justice system ', ' 12 years of age ', ' age 12 years ', ' twelve year old ', ' twelve years of age ', ' 12 year old ', ' 21 years of age ', ' age 21 ', ' age 21 years ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' twenty-one years of age ', ' 21 year old ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' apprentice ', ' apprenticeship ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' recruit ', ' intervention cost ', ' intervention participants ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,539088,0.046187640183499384
"Emotional Wellbeing and Reproductive Health in a Prospective Study of Multiple Generations of Immigrant Latino Youth Project Summary/Abstract  This is an application for a K23 award for Marissa Raymond-Flesch, MD, MPH, whose research focuses on the reproductive health and health disparities of Latino adolescents. She has completed three primary data collection projects utilizing community-engaged qualitative methods and has been contributing to the Salinas Teen Health Study, on which this application builds, for the past two years. Her research training includes a masters of public health and fellowships in Adolescent Medicine and Health Policy. Through the activities proposed in this application Dr. Raymond-Flesch will build skills in cross-sectional and longitudinal quantitative data analysis. She will benefit from UCSF's nationally recognized Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine and Institute for Health Policy Studies as well as the university's course work in biostatistics and research methodology. In addition, UCSF will continue to support her productive collaboration with the Salinas Teen Health Study team at RTI. Across these intuitions Dr. Raymond-Flesch has established an experienced mentoring team with expertise in epidemiology, mixed methods research, and adolescent reproductive and mental health. By the completion of this award she will be well positioned to launch a career as an independent investigator, including applying for an R01 award.  Informed by the social ecological model, this proposal builds on the Salinas Teen Health Study (R01- HD075787), a prospective cohort study of 600 Latino adolescents over two years as they transition from early to middle adolescence in a Californian agricultural community. Latino youth experience a variety of health disparities, including higher rates of depression and adverse reproductive health outcomes (unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections). Current evidence links depression with negative sexual and reproductive health outcomes in adults, but there is a paucity of research on these associations in Latino adolescents. Additionally, data on how immigrant generation affects these outcomes for Latino adolescents are limited. Dr. Raymond-Flesch's specific aims include a quantitative analysis of the associations between depressive symptoms and sexual and reproductive health outcomes at baseline across first, second, and third generation Latino early adolescents (Aim 1); longitudinal analysis of two years of quantitative data to determine the effect of depressive symptoms during early adolescence on subsequent sexual and reproductive health (Aim 2); qualitative analysis of youth interviews to describe how emotional wellbeing influences sexual and reproductive health (Aim 3); and qualitative interviews with mothers to characterize early environmental and structural factors affecting emotional wellbeing, psychosocial development, and sexual and reproductive health for Latino youth (Aim 4). The roles of immigrant generation and protective family influences will be examined across all aims. At the conclusion of this award Dr. Raymond-Flesch will apply findings to the development of a R01 application for a culturally informed intervention to reduce mental and reproductive health disparities. Project Narrative Public Health Relevance Latinas have disparately high rates of pregnancy compared to all other racial and ethnic groups of adolescents, with rates highest in California among rural populations, despite falling rates of teen pregnancy nationally. Factors such as emotional health and immigrant generation likely impact engagement in the high risk sexual and reproductive health behaviors that give rise to high rates of teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and other poor health outcomes for these youth, but additional research is needed to understand the individual, family, and structural factors that give rise to these disparities, particularly for youth in agricultural communities. This study uses quantitative and qualitative methods, including questionnaires and interviews with youth and mothers, to prospectively investigate the individual, family, and structural factors that either promote positive youth development or place youth at risk for high risk sexual and reproductive health outcomes such as pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.",Emotional Wellbeing and Reproductive Health in a Prospective Study of Multiple Generations of Immigrant Latino Youth,10002282,K23HD093839,"['Fertility Control ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' positive youth development ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' career development ', ' psychosocial development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Sexual Health ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' M.P.H.

"Biopsychosocial Pathways Linking Discrimination and Adolescent Health PROJECT SUMMARY Incidents of discrimination are part of the everyday life experiences of adolescents of color, and although many studies document the negative psychological and academic repercussions of discrimination, we know almost nothing about how discrimination gets under the skin to influence adolescent health. Yet it is precisely these processes that could initiate racial/ethnic health disparities observed in adult populations, and adolescence is the key time to study these processes since the social-cognitive ability to recognize discriminatory treatment emerges in the second decade of life. My proposed project targets biodemography and the biopsychosocial pathways by which discrimination influences adolescent health and well-being. I have two primary aims for my K01 award: 1) gain extensive training in biodemography that will build my expertise as a population dynamics scholar and 2) test a biopsychosocial model of racial/ethnic discrimination using secondary data from three population-based studies with young adult samples and primary data from collected from adolescents. These aims will allow me to achieve my long-term career goals of a) enhancing interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in my department around population dynamics and biomarkers across the lifespan and b) developing an R01 grant that tests a larger biopsychosocial model that integrates what I learn in my K01 award with an examination of potential buffers that might protect adolescents from the pernicious effects of discrimination. My primary mentor for the K01 award is demographer Mark Hayward, with biobehavioral psychologist Elizabeth Susman, adolescent health nursing professor Lynn Rew, and health psychologist Velma McBride Murry serving as co-mentors. My career development plan includes frequent mentoring meetings, off- site training sessions and conferences, on-site coursework, biomarker and health field and lab experiences, and R01 application preparation. This training plan is critical for my research study that focuses on three aims: 1) investigate the biopsychosocial pathways linking perceptions of discrimination to mental and physical health, 2) examine how SES and SES marginalization contribute to the biopsychosocial pathways of interest, and 3) assess the degree to which gender and pubertal development condition the biopsychosocial pathways. The research study includes analyses of population data from the NSAL, NLAAS, and Add Health along with primary data collected from 100 participants (drawn from a larger study that I am conducting) who report experiencing various constellations of racial/ethnic discrimination. This training and research agenda fits squarely within the growing subfield of biodemography, where biological insights are being integrated into models of population health and health dynamics. My training and my foundation of empirical research leave me well-situated to pursue this critical line of inquiry, but I can only do so with the career development provided by this K01 award. Receiving the K01 award would contribute substantially to my intellectual development, my research skills, and my ability to become an independent biodemographer and population dynamics scholar. PROJECT NARRATIVE Investigation of biopsychosocial processes, particularly those revolving around discrimination, are crucial to developing a well-rounded understanding of the etiology of racial/ethnic health disparities and to identifying new and innovative policy interventions. This study examines the biopsychosocial pathways that link experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination to adolescents' mental and physical health and well-being, and career development in biodemography and population dynamics is critical for undertaking this research. Capturing the vulnerability that Americans of color face in a more multifaceted and comprehensive way than in past research is important to both theorizing about and taking action on racial/ethnic

"Substance Use Among American Indian Youth: Epidemiology & Etiology Project Summary  Substance use (SU) rates among American Indian (AI) adolescents have been greater than national rates for decades, and recent evidence indicates that some SU disparities are increasing for AI adolescents living on or near reservations (hereafter reservation). Given the changing nature of SU and the unique influences on this population (e.g., factors specific to reservation life), continued surveillance and dissemination of SU rates for these youth is vitally important to inform prevention, treatment, and policy efforts.  The proposed study is a renewal of a large-scale epidemiological study of SU among reservation AI adolescents, the only study of its kind. Each year, nationally-representative rates of SU for reservation AI adolescents will be obtained and compared with national rates measured by Monitoring the Future (MTF) in order to identify areas of special concern for reservation AI adolescents. The sample will be expanded to include 6th graders due to early initiation rates of AI youth. The study will move beyond basic epidemiology to include additional analyses of low-base rate/high-risk SU (e.g., methamphetamine, opioids) and heavy marijuana use, examining simultaneous and co-occurring use, predictors of use, and consequences of use. Because data are gathered from a wide variety of contexts (e.g., reservations), a comprehensive multilevel analysis examining relationships of school/community factors will be conducted, building on epidemiologic models. The findings from these analyses will provide essential information for reducing health disparities that result from structural and economic inequities, policy, and allocation of resources.  Building etiologic evidence for effective intervention to address high rates of adolescent AI SU is also a fundamental part of this project. Although AI adolescents are influenced by broader society, unique individual, cultural, geographic, economic, and other factors influence SU and its correlates and consequences. Moreover, there has been limited focus on understanding how positive characteristics related to strength and resilience serve as protective or promotive factors for AI adolescents. Etiologic models, based on eco-systemic resilience theory, will be used to assess the role of individual, cultural and collective measures of strength and resilience to identify relationships to SU and delayed or nonuse. Measures of low-base rate/high-risk and heavy marijuana use will be included as dependent variables in these analyses. An ongoing discussion among AI researchers is the need for systematic analysis of the role of racial-ethnic and cultural identity in SU behaviors; therefore, this study will give special emphasis to assessing psychometric properties of measures of racial/ethnic identity that have been used successfully for prediction in this and other populations.  Project findings will be disseminated to key stakeholders, with special emphasis on tribal and non-tribal entities involved in policy and resource-related decisions that affect AI youth SU. Project Narrative Substance use rates among American Indian adolescents have been greater than national rates for decades, and recent evidence indicates that some substance use disparities are increasing for American Indian adolescents living on or near reservations (hereafter reservation). This proposed study will continue to monitor rates of use for reservation American Indian adolescents and compare these rates to national rates, in addition to estimating relationships between substance use and measures of strength and resilience especially pertinent to this population. The findings from this study will be disseminated to key stakeholders including participating schools and local and national Native groups and organizations, and will inform prevention, intervention, and policy efforts designed to reduce substance use among this population.",Substance Use Among American Indian Youth: Epidemiology & Etiology,10115405,R01DA003371,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Behavior ', ' Cocaine ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Hallucinogens ', ' Hallucinogenic Agents ', ' Hallucinogenic Drugs ', ' Hallucinogenic Substances ', ' Psychedelic Agents ', ' Psychedelics ', ' Psychotomimetic Agents ', ' psychedelic drug ', ' psychotomimetic drug ', ' Health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Literature ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methods ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Societies ', ' Students ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Native-Born ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native People ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Policies ', ' Native Americans ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' American Indian reservation ', ' nation reservation ', ' native american reservation ', ' reservation community ', ' tribal reservation ', ' Indian reservation ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Reservations ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Community Health ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' 6th grade ', ' sixth grade ', ' substance use among adolescents ', ' substance use among youth ', ' youth substance use ', ' adolescent substance use ', ' epidemiological model ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' reduction in substance use ', ' substance use reduction ', ' reduced substance use ', ' THC co-use ', ' THC use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol co-use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol use ', ' cannabis use ', ' marijuana use ', ' ethnic identity ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIDA,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,759732,-0.00802632100473883
"Pathways to Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Prevention in Adolescent and Adult Women. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) encompass a wide range of symptoms, including urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, bladder pain, urinary tract infections, and voiding symptoms. There is an extensive literature describing the many approaches to treatment of LUTS, but less is known about prevention. The “Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (PLUS) Consortium is a transdisciplinary scientific network established to expand research beyond the treatment of LUTS to promotion of bladder health and prevention of LUTS in adolescents and women across the life course. Despite many epidemiologic studies on risk factors for LUTS, little research has examined factors that promote bladder health. One key gap is in understanding of what defines healthy voiding and toileting behaviors and how these behaviors affect bladder health over time. Our overarching hypothesis is that maladaptive voiding and toileting behaviors contribute to poorer bladder health among adolescent and adult women. The primary aim of this proposal is to continue our participation as a clinical research center in PLUS and collaborate with other centers to design and conduct a longitudinal cohort study that lays the foundation for developing future prevention interventions to promote bladder health and prevent LUTS. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) team is an interdisciplinary group of investigators with collective expertise in LUTS clinical research, behavioral medicine, geriatric medicine, adolescent medicine, prevention science, public health, epidemiology, biostatistics, health disparities, and medical sociology. Our team is poised to contribute expertise on 1) design and conduct of longitudinal studies, 2) evaluation and treatment of LUTS (including clinical examination and bio-specimen collection), 3) qualitative methods, 4) recruitment and retention of diverse samples of participants with/without LUTS, and 5) community engagement. The second aim is to build on the longitudinal cohort study to examine two additional potential risk/protective factors for bladder health and LUTS that are plausible targets for future intervention studies. In addition to testing a number of other factors in the national cohort, we propose to examine 1) the role of neighborhood disadvantage in relation to voiding and toileting behaviors, using the Area Deprivation Index, and 2) the association of functional ability with voiding and toileting behaviors using gait speed and bio-markers of inflammation. Understanding the role of these factors will support the development of models for identifying at- risk individuals and groups, as well as inform education initiatives. The third aim is to develop and conduct pilot foundational studies related to promoting healthy voiding and toileting behaviors. The first study aims to understand voiding and toileting behaviors across environments among adolescents using a mobile application with geographic information system mapping. The second aims to develop a mobile health self-management educational program for promoting healthy bladder behaviors. These projects will lay the foundation for the development of future research on interventions to promote bladder health across the life course. NARRATIVE The “Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms” (PLUS) Research Consortium is a transdisciplinary U.S. scientific network established to expand research beyond the detection and treatment of LUTS to the promotion of bladder health and prevention of LUTS in adolescents and women across the life course. Our overarching hypothesis is that healthy voiding and toileting behaviors contribute to improved bladder health and decreased LUTS for adolescent and adult women. Our transdisciplinary PLUS team at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) proposes three interrelated pathways related to healthy voiding and toileting behaviors that may impact bladder health and prevention of LUTS: (1) conducting a longitudinal cohort study of women to assess bladder health and LUTS across the life course; (2) increase understanding of risk and protective factors to inform plausible intervention targets for healthy voiding and toileting behaviors; and (3) developing delivery models for future bladder health education programming.",Pathways to Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Prevention in Adolescent and Adult Women.,10053158,U01DK106858,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adolescent Medicine ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alabama ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exercise ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' indexing ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Nocturia ', ' Nycturia ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Medical Sociology ', ' medicine sociology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Urethra ', ' urethral ', ' Increased frequency of micturition ', ' Urinary Frequency ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' urinary infection ', ' Urination ', ' micturition ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' micturition urgency ', ' Urgency to pass urine ', ' Urgent desire to urinate ', ' urinary urgency ', ' urination urgency ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Self Management ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' teacher ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' bladder pain ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Occupational ', ' lower urinary tract symptoms ', ' environmental stressor ', ' physical state ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' social ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Detection ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Collection ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' social wellbeing ', ' Social Well-Being ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' neighborhood association ', ' adolescent woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' young woman ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' Gait speed ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' clinical exam ', ' clinical examination ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2020,400000,0.03982220688487546
"Improving the Reproductive Health of Families Adolescents in Botswana face extraordinary reproductive health challenges. Teen pregnancy forces girls to leave school after which few resume their education. Botswana has the second highest HIV prevalence in the world, with incidence increasing rapidly at ages 15-19, peaking at 40.2% prevalence by ages 30-34. STIs are prevalent despite the availability of free health care. Traditional sex education, provided in now banned village initiation schools, is no longer available and parents are uncomfortable discussing reproductive health within the family. In an earlier R34 award, guided by a Community Advisory Board and Adolescent Advisory Group, we conducted formative interviews, assessed the psychometric adequacy of the proposed measures, and adapted and assessed the feasibility and acceptability of interventions for youth and their parents. We now propose to conduct a 3-arm randomized controlled trial with 500 families, ½ with a male and ½ with a female adolescent age 13-18. Arm 1 (N = 200) will receive the parent intervention “Families Matter 2!” (FM2!) and their adolescent will participate in “Living as a Safer Teen” (LAST). In Arm 2 (N = 200), parents receive FM2! Only and six months later their adolescents will receive LAST allowing us to assess the impact of the parent program alone and potential boost in outcomes when adolescents are also engaged in intervention. Arm 3 (N = 100), the comparison arm, will be the current, widely-delivered program in Botswana. Each adolescent and parent dyad will complete ACASI assessments in English or Setswana at baseline, post-intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-ups on family communication, parenting practices, knowledge of sexual development, and sexual behavior. Youth will also complete psychosocial measures assessing attitudes toward condoms, perceived barriers to sexual safety, attitudes toward transactional sex, acceptance of gender violence, and self-efficacy. Gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will be tested at baseline and 12-month follow-up for adolescents. A pilot trial affirmed the feasibility of recruiting parent(caretaker)/adolescent dyads and retention exceeded 95% for both parents and adolescents. While the pilot trial was underpowered, results suggest that the interventions improved family communication, child management skills, knowledge of sexual development, attitudes toward contraception; lowered tolerance for intergenerational transactional sex and gender violence; and lowered sexual risk behavior of both parents and adolescents in the intervention arm. In addition, youths who were abstinent upon entering the pilot intervention appear to have delayed sexual debut more successfully than the comparison arm. This study addresses the highest priority in Botswana’s current national strategic plan. If the results provide strong evidence of effectiveness, the Ministries of Education, Health, Youth & Culture, National AIDS Coordinating Agency, and the Office of the President have committed to its dissemination throughout Botswana. This application proposes to deliver and evaluate a pilot-tested multi-level reproductive health intervention for Batswana adolescents and their parents. The study will evaluate interventions designed to improve reproductive health outcomes for adolescents and their families that are designed to have high public health impact. Program impact will be evaluated with cognitive, behavioral, biomedical and cost effectiveness endpoints from baseline across the following year and the results have broad applicability throughout

"An Examination of Polytobacco Use Trajectories and Socioecological Risk Factors Project Summary Tobacco use is high among adolescents of low socioeconomic status (SES). While tobacco regulation has contributed to steady declines in cigarette use among youth, these declines have occurred more quickly for high SES compared to low SES adolescents. Moreover, the proportion of polytobacco users (i.e., users of more than one tobacco product) has increased among adolescents. Polytobacco use among adolescents may be attributed to increasing popularity of alternative tobacco products (e.g., e-cigarette, blunts cigar, hookah, and smokeless tobacco). Polytobacco use among adolescents is concerning, as it may increase cancer risk and result in consumption of unknown or inconsistent concentrations of nicotine, which could interfere with brain development. Tobacco companies target consumers based on clearly defined user segments. Likewise, the success of tobacco regulatory efforts can be bolstered by a deeper understanding of how polytobacco use is segmented among adolescents. Our own studies of Connecticut youth have shown that low SES is associated with greater likelihood of polytobacco use. Although some research has started to examine trajectories of polytobacco use, to date, there are no studies that have examined latent classes of trajectories to show how youth progress across stages of use (i.e., never use to established user) for multiple products simultaneously. Additionally, a socioecological framework has yet to be applied to examine the mediators of the association between SES and polytobacco use. To address these gaps, this study aims to use longitudinal data (Waves 1-4) from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, a nationally representative survey, to: 1) examine group-based multi-trajectory models (and socioecologically-informed predictors) of youth use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigar/cigarillo, hookah and smokeless tobacco and 2) conduct path analysis to examine environmental, social and intrapersonal mediators of the association between SES and polytobacco use. This study will produce evidence of: 1) distinct trajectories describing stages of polytobacco use and 2) how distinct elements of the environmental, social, and intrapersonal context, contribute to SES-based disparities in polytobacco use. Such evidence is especially important, as one cannot efficiently and effectively intervene to reduce polytobacco use without understanding how polytobacco use emerges and how it is sustained. Moreover, as noted in the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) 2017 monograph on socioecological risk factors for tobacco use “identifying mechanisms through which SES influences tobacco use may result in new potential targets for interventions that could ultimately reduce tobacco-related health disparities.” Project Narrative Polytobacco use (i.e., use of two or more tobacco products) among adolescents is concerning, as it may increase cancer risk. The proportion of polytobacco users has increased nationally among adolescents and polytobacco use is more likely among youth of low SES. By identifying polytobacco trajectories associated with SES and mediators of the relationship between SES and polytobacco use, we will support the development of policies and interventions to reduce polytobacco use disparities.",An Examination of Polytobacco Use Trajectories and Socioecological Risk Factors,9881559,R03CA245991,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Connecticut ', ' development policy ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Nicotine ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Personality ', ' Personality Development ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Smoking ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Smokeless Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad resin ', ' Friends ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Policies ', ' Monograph ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' tobacco company ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' Stream ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Surgeon ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' Cigar ', ' member ', ' narghile ', ' shisha ', ' water pipe ', ' waterpipe ', ' hookah ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' exposure to tobacco ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' human capital ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' stem ', ' high risk ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' health data ', ' poly-tobacco use ', ' polytobacco use ', ' poly-tobacco ', ' polytobacco ', ' Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health ', ' cigarillos ', ' tobacco user ', ' tobacco products ', ' social factors ', ' ']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,83750,-0.01278643557540792
"Biopsychosocial Pathways Linking Discrimination and Adolescent Health PROJECT SUMMARY: Incidents of discrimination are part of the everyday life experiences of adolescents of color, yet we know almost nothing about how discrimination gets under the skin to influence adolescent health. Although discrimination (the focus of the original K01) is a clear stressor in the lives of youth, with the COVID- 19 pandemic, an unexpected and potent new stressor has been introduced to adolescents’ daily lives. Moreover, the stark inequities in health and disease burden borne by the poor and racial/ethnic minorities in the U.S. have been laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic, and certain groups are encountering discriminatory treatment tied directly to the pandemic. As such, the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the discrimination experienced by adolescents both within and outside the context of COVID-19, could initiate or further contribute to health disparities tied to race/ethnicity and social class observed in adult populations. Adolescence is a key time to study these stress processes since the social-cognitive ability to recognize discriminatory treatment emerges in the second decade of life, as do effective coping mechanisms for dealing with major life stressors, such as those tied to the current pandemic. My proposed competitive revision targets biodemography and the pathways by which COVID-19 stress/stressors influence developmental trajectories of adolescent health and well-being. In addition to integrating COVID-19 stressors into the biopsychosocial model tested in my original K01 (Aim 1), I introduce two new primary aims for my research project as part of the K01 competitive revision: (1) Document the extent to which COVID-19 is influencing all aspects of the daily lives of adolescents and (2) Examine the extent to which COVID-19 is disrupting trajectories of well-being. To address these new research aims, I will leverage three waves of rich longitudinal data from a racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample collected pre-pandemic (annually from 8th to 10th grades) with three new data collection waves collected during the pandemic (11th and 12th grade). These data will allow me to document how COVID-19 may be disrupting trajectories and psychological well-being, physical health, and academics, the extent to which these disruptions are temporary (denoting recovery) versus long-lasting, who is more likely to recover, and how relationships with important others (families, teachers/schools, friends) might mitigate disruptions. Along with these survey data, I will integrate interviews to delve deeply into COVID-19 and the lived experiences of adolescents during the pandemic as well as daily diaries to capture how daily processes, social interactions, and well-being are influenced by COVID-19 stressors. Texas relaxed social distancing requirements May 1, 2020 without reaching goals for adequate COVID-19 testing, and it thus provides an important backdrop for understanding how this global pandemic is compromising adolescents’ trajectories in real-time. This will provide invaluable information for those designing and implementing interventions for adolescents as they weather major life stressors and larger sociohistorical events. PROJECT NARRATIVE Investigation of biopsychosocial processes, particularly those revolving around discrimination and other major life stressors, are crucial to understanding the etiology health disparities and to identifying new and innovative policy interventions. This revision examines how the COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting trajectories of adolescent well-being spanning mental and physical health and academics as the pandemic unfolds in real-time, placing particular attention on who is at particular risk and what promotes resilience. Capturing the vulnerability that young people face in this broad-reaching pandemic is important to both theorizing about and taking action on health disparities in the population.",Biopsychosocial

"Reaching 90 90 90 in Adolescents in Zambia: Using all our SKILLZ Project Summary/ Abstract Despite considerable progress, many countries are still struggling to achieve the UNAIDS 90 90 90 targets. These targets have been particularly challenging amongst adolescent girls, with poorer uptake, retention and viral suppression being reported3-6 Grassroot Soccer (GRS) and the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ) have collaborated to develop a comprehensive adolescent package that providse sexual and reproductive health services (SRH), including HIV testing and treatment, in adolescent friendly spaces. This program builds off a strong social support with peer mentoring and the use of social networking and adolescent-friendly clinical services that integrate HIV with sexual and reproductive health services (SRH). The `SKILLZ programme' developed for adolescent girls by GRS generates demand for all steps in the HIV cascade among young women. It is a sport-based school intervention, to increase the use of HIV and SRH services and to improve psychosocial well-being, including self-esteem, empowerment, and self-sufficiency. To ensure an uninterrupted continuum of care, we have integrated SKILLZ with CIDRZ teen services to create `SKILLZ Plus', a seamless 90-90-90 pathway for adolescents in Zambia. Instead of focusing on changing young women's attitudes towards their own risk using a medical model, we leverage the power of soccer, local peer mentors and female life coaches to build bridges between young women and services often viewed as inaccessible, distant or irrelevant. Our Specific Aims are to 1.Examine the incremental cost effectiveness of SKILLZ Girl on HIV testing among adolescent girls in secondary schools in Lusaka using a quasi-experimental impact evaluation. 2. Assess the impact of SKILLZ Plus over two years on viral load suppression (Aim 2a) at 6 months and retention at 6 months, 12 months and 24 months (Aim 2b) through an individual-level randomized controlled trial for those who test positive and 3. Identify mediators, predictors and barriers to uptake of SKILLZ Plus (testing, retention and viral load suppression) both quantitatively through mediation and moderation analyses and qualitatively through focus groups discussions (FGD) with coaches and girls. Project Narrative Despite considerable progress, many countries continue to struggle to achieve the UNAIDS 90 90 90 targets, particularly amongst adolescents.

"Interpersonal- and Community-Level Risk Factors for Adolescent Obesity: An Examination of Sexual Identity, School Violence, and School Climate in a Large Sample of Urban Adolescents PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adolescent obesity, a preventable chronic condition that affects over 1 in 5 adolescents (ages 12-19 years) in the United States, has been linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and high cholesterol. The cost attributed to adolescent obesity is approximately $14 billion annually, and obesity shortens life expectancy by up to eight years. Sexual minority adolescents (SMA; those who identify as gay/lesbian or bisexual, or who are unsure of their sexual identity) are significantly more likely to be obese and to have lower rates of physical activity and higher rates of sedentary behavior compared to their heterosexual peers. School violence (e.g., bullying and other violent acts) is associated with obesity, such that obesity risk is increased due to negative health behavior engagement in response to violent events. Given that SMA experience school violence at disproportionately high rates compared to their heterosexual peers, it is possible that school violence helps account for their higher risk of obesity. A protective school climate (i.e., a school with policies and practices that protect sexual minorities) is an important community-level determinant that has been shown to decrease sexual-minority-related school violence. Despite these known associations, few investigations have examined the relationship between school violence and obesity among SMA, and none have examined how school climate may influence this relationship. The proposed study will address these gaps through secondary analysis of cross-sectional, district-level pooled data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (from which we will obtain individual-level health behaviors and interpersonal-level school violence data) linked with the CDC's School Health Profiles (from which we will obtain community-level school climate data). Guided by an adapted Social Ecological Model, the specific aims are: (1) to examine the association between school violence and obesity and whether it differs for SMA and their heterosexual peers, and (2) to examine the association among sexual identity, school violence, and obesity and whether it differs across different levels of school climate. The proposed aims are consistent with the goals of the National Institute of Nursing Research and align with its strategic plan to support science that investigates key social and environmental factors that promote long-term wellness and prevent the development of disease across settings and the lifespan, with the goal of eliminating health disparities. To facilitate such research, the applicant will build her knowledge and skills in sexual minority health, adolescent chronic disease, and multilevel modeling and moderation analysis. With the mentorship of a dedicated and National Institutes of Health-funded interdisciplinary research team, and the resource-rich environment of Columbia University, the applicant will build a strong foundation from which to move toward her long-term goal of becoming an independent nurse scientist with expertise in obesity-related health disparities among SMA. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority adolescents have significantly higher rates of obesity compared to their heterosexual counterparts, and they experience unique interpersonal-level stressors and community-level environments that increase their obesity risk. This study will test relationships between school violence (interpersonal-level risk) and school climate (community-level risk) on obesity among sexual minority and heterosexual adolescents. Findings can be used to inform the design of targeted, evidence-based interventions that promote protective school climates and prevent or reduce school violence, ultimately lowering risk of obesity among SMA and their heterosexual peers.","Interpersonal- and Community-Level Risk Factors for Adolescent Obesity: An Examination of Sexual Identity, School Violence, and School Climate in a Large

"Preventing IPV and Reproductive Coercion Among Underserved Adolescents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the candidate with training and research experiences that will promote her development as an independent clinician-researcher, with particular emphasis in the field of healthcare-based intervention research addressing gender-based violence, specifically reproductive coercion (RC), among medically underserved female adolescents in Mexico. This training will provide her with the opportunity to develop knowledge and skills in: 1) reproductive coercion (RC) epidemiology, assessment and prevention; 2) acquire knowledge in the theory, development, implementation, and adaptation of theoretically driven clinic-based behavioral interventions to reduce RC; 3) Acquire skills in multilevel modeling of longitudinal data to assess the efficacy of clinic-based behavioral interventions. Training activities will include didactic coursework and specific workshops, directed readings and one-on-one tutorials with mentors, and instruction in the responsible conduct of research. The candidate will receive mentorship from a Training Committee comprised of globally renowned experts in the fields of gender-based violence, reproductive coercion, adolescent health, healthcare-based screening and brief interventions for RC and epidemiology research. The present K23 research project emerges from the existing research infrastructure of Drs. Silverman and Miller's ARCHES (Addressing Reproductive Coercion in Healthcare Settings) intervention, specific aims are to conduct secondary data analysis of the sub-sample of adolescents (16-20 years old) from ARCHES and 1) Conduct epidemiologic research to estimate the prevalence and correlates of RC among US female adolescents ages 16-20 (n=1311) from the ARCHES intervention; 2) Conduct multilevel longitudinal data analyses of the ARCHES adolescent sample to evaluate the effect of the intervention on RC among this group; 3) Conduct qualitative research to identify barriers to and adapt the ARCHES intervention to improve the reproductive autonomy of female adolescents in urban health clinics in Tijuana (Mexico); 4) Implement the adapted ARCHES intervention for female adolescents in urban health clinics in Tijuana, pilot test its feasibility and estimate effect sizes needed for future lrge-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT). While the specified initial goal of this work is a clinic-based intervention model adapted for adolescent health care in Mexico, the candidates' longer-term goal is to expand implementation of such programs throughout Latin America and in other low and middle-income countries. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reproductive Coercion (RC) has been associated with numerous negative effects on the physical, sexual, and mental health of young women and girls, with RC prevalence the highest among adolescents; 20% of adolescent family planning (FP) clients reporting such abuse. Findings from the proposed research will be critical to the adaptation, implementation, and evaluation of theoretically driven, empirically informed behavioral interventions that address RC among adolescents in a Latin-American country (Mexico) that can be further applied to other settings. In addition, the proposed project will allo the candidate to master a complex set of research skills in development and evaluation of theoretically driven clinic-based interventions, and develop topical expertise required to fully characterize and reduce the impact of RC, and potentially unintended pregnancies among underserved female adolescents in Mexico and other low and middle-income

"R-CITY: Erasing Racism and Violence through Collaborative Intervention with Teachers and Youth G.220 - R&R Other Project Information Form 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Pervasive exposure to violence in urban areas puts youth at risk for subsequent perpetration of violence, chronic psychological trauma, and mental and behavioral health problems. Yet many urban schools lack resources to provide adequate support. When under-resourced schools are concentrated in racial and ethnic minority communities, health disparities theory suggests this is a reflection of structural racism and discrimination (R/D). Structural R/D is a multi-level, multi-domain construct with societal (e.g., under-resourced segregated schools), institutional (e.g., racial disparities in punitive discipline), interpersonal (e.g., cultural marginalization and teacher implicit bias), and intrapersonal (e.g., internalized stereotypes) forms that may contribute to youth incidence of violence. These examples of structural racism are compounded in Baltimore City Public Schools (City Schools), an urban district serving primarily Black students and families in de facto segregated schools with racial disparities in out-of-school suspension rates. Rigorous research studies by our team have shown that youth violence prevention models such as Coping Power can produce significant reductions in aggressive behavior among early adolescents in City Schools. However, neither Coping Power, nor any other youth violence prevention interventions to our knowledge, have incorporated strategies that move beyond coping with R/D to actively preventing R/D. We hypothesize that integrating R/D prevention strategies with youth violence preventive intervention will result in a synergistic effect, producing greater reductions in aggression than youth violence preventive interventions alone, while reducing structural R/D at multiple levels. The proposed project integrates a universal, classroom-based adaptation of the evidence-based intervention Coping Power for Baltimore City youth with the Double Check professional development and coaching intervention for teachers, administrators, and school police. Called R-CITY (Erasing Racism and Youth Violence through Collaboration with Teachers and Youth), the project builds on our previous federally-funded research adapting and efficacy testing both preventive interventions in middle schools. We propose to assess the “value-added” of integrating Coping Power and Double Check (CP+DC), compared to Coping Power alone (CP Only), using a school-level, RCT in 40 Baltimore City middle schools. We will assess the effects of the integrated CP+DC intervention on youth violence and intrapersonal R/D, on classroom interpersonal R/D (including culturally responsive practices and equitable and inclusive youth engagement), and on school institutional R/D (as measured by youth-report of racial climate and disparities in suspensions). Four cohorts of 10 schools will be randomly assigned each year to receive the integrated CP+DC intervention or to receive CP Only. Assessments of outcomes will be administered at pre-test in the fall, post-test in the spring, and at one-year follow-up. G.220 - R&R Other Project Information Form 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will contribute to the limited number of interventions shown to reduce of youth violence, which is a significant public health concern in the US. This study will show that Coping Power is an effective youth violence prevention intervention designed specifically for school-based implementation. The added value of the Double Check model components to address structural racism and discrimination in schools will create a synergistic effect for greater reductions in youth violence.",R-CITY: Erasing Racism and Violence through Collaborative Intervention with Teachers and Youth,9891095,R01MD013808,"['Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Attention ', ' Baltimore ', ' Budgets ', ' Cities ', ' Civil Rights ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Color ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Stress ', ' Suspensions ', ' Suspension substance ', ' Testing ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Police ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' falls ', ' Administrator ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Discipline ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' junior high ', ' middle school ', ' junior high school ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Interruption ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' post intervention ', ' psychologic trauma ', ' psychological shock ', ' psychological trauma ', ' teen violence ', ' youth violence ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' evidence base ', ' prevent youth violence ', ' youth violence prevention ', ' reduce youth violence ', ' efficacy testing ', ' sexual minority ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' marginalization ', ' social exclusion ', ' student engagement ', ' student motivation ', ' student participation ', ' violence perpetration ', ' black student ', ' African American student ', ' implicit bias ', ' racial minority ', ' urban school ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,612580,0.05050525263133751
"Multi-level Emergency Department Intervention to Reduce Pregnancy Risk Among Adolescents PROJECT SUMMARY The burden of adolescent unintended pregnancy in the US is substantial, despite declines in pregnancy rates in recent years. Although highly effective contraceptive methods exist, adolescents face multi-level barriers to contraceptive access and use. Research focused on increasing contraception initiation among adolescents is crucial. The emergency department (ED) is a non-traditional setting that is well-positioned to provide reproductive care, as almost 19 million adolescents seek care in EDs each year, many are amenable to receiving care in this setting, and the ED is often the only or primary contact with the health care system for the highest-risk youth. We propose a novel contraceptive counseling intervention for the ED setting that address barriers at the patient, provider, and system levels. Building on previous work and drawing on proven strategies from traditional settings, we will train ED advanced practice nurses to provide counseling utilizing Motivational Interviewing strategies to facilitate uptake of ED-based contraception or clinic referral among sexually active females aged 15-18 years. We will conduct a small randomized trial to evaluate these feasibility constructs using mixed methodology: acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, adaptation, integration, expansion, and limited-efficacy. We compare two arms (intervention vs. enhanced standard of care) to determine size of effect rates on contraception initiation. We gather data to inform a future study to evaluate individual components and identify the most parsimonious combination of active components using an adaptive design. We expect these data to inform a trial with adequate sample to evaluate efficacy among contraceptive subtypes and to identify characteristics that enhance or inhibit contraception use. This project is significant because the national burden of adolescent childbearing ($9.4 billion for one year alone) is so great, even a small reduction in incidence should lead to significant cost reductions and reduce generational cycles of poverty and poor health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The burden of adolescent unintended pregnancy in the US is substantial, despite declines in pregnancy rates in recent years.

"Early adolescents living in adversity: a global mixed methods study The goal of the proposed fellowship is to prepare the applicant, Shoshanna Fine, for a career in applied psychosocial health research applicable to global and domestic populations, with a specific focus on investigating and improving mental well-being among vulnerable youth living in contexts of adversity. To this end, the applicant proposes to investigate psychosocial risks among early adolescents (10-14 years) living in low-resource urban settings across low-, middle-, and high-income countries. The applicant will carry out the proposed research alongside individualized mentorship, didactic training, and professional development opportunities targeted towards the following training objectives: 1) develop expertise in psychosocial health among vulnerable youth living in contexts of adversity, with a focus on the biological, psychological, and social factors that relate to youth development; 2) attain proficiency in applying mixed methods approaches that integrate advanced statistical techniques (including latent variable modeling) with in-depth qualitative analysis; and 3) strengthen skills in grant writing and effective dissemination of scientific findings to academic and nonacademic audiences, domestically and internationally. These objectives will help propel the applicant towards an independent and productive research career. The proposed research is of high  public health relevance. Adolescence is a critical developmental period, with the social-emotional skills and health-related behaviors that emerge during this time serving as a foundation for future well-being. While the majority of the world’s adolescents live in contexts of adversity, many of which can be found in low- and middle-income countries, only a fraction of the research on adolescent psychosocial development has been conducted in these settings. Successful prevention strategies targeting youth living in contexts of adversity require an understanding of the co-occurring emotional and behavioral risks that signify underlying psychosocial vulnerability, as well as the social environments that exacerbate and buffer these risks. Further, there is a need for studies across low-, middle-, and high-income countries to assess the contextual generalizability of key factors in adolescent psychosocial development. Finally, mixed methods approaches can enrich such investigations by providing a more comprehensive exploration of psychosocial risks in adolescence than would be obtainable from relying solely on one set of methods. To fill these gaps, the proposed research will use data from the multi-country Global Early Adolescent Study to: 1) characterize typologies of psychosocial risks among early adolescents, and explore whether these typologies vary by gender and urban setting; 2) assess associations between these typologies and key social environmental risk and protective factors; and 3) qualitatively explore the meanings that adolescents in one urban setting ascribe to risk behaviors based on membership in different typologies. The proposed research aligns with the NICHD’s priority to study psychosocial adjustment for individuals in high-risk environments.",Early adolescents living in adversity: a global mixed methods study,10012759,F31HD100161,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Behavior ', ' Belgium ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Buffers ', ' China ', ' Mainland China ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Ecuador ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Indonesia ', ' East Indies ', ' Malay Archipelago ', ' Netherlands East Indies ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Malawi ', ' Nyasaland ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Probability ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Writing ', ' Democratic Republic of the Congo ', ' Belgian Congo ', ' Zaire ', ' Gender ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Nature ', ' Individual Adjustment ', ' Victimization ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Feels well ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' psychological wellness ', ' self wellness ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' Well in self ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' peer ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' psychosocial development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial support ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Subgroup ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' peer victimization ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' migration ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' psychosocial adjustment ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' urban setting ', ' protective factors ', ' social factors ', ' ']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,18134,0.116191993507757
"Emergence of Implicit Bias during Adolescent Development 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed research investigates how implicit racial bias develops and can be counteracted among racial majority adolescents. Racial majority adults’ implicit bias toward lower-status racial groups perpetuates societal inequalities in health (e.g., via subpar medical care), wealth (e.g., via biased hiring), and well-being (e.g., via discriminatory social interactions). Developmental research identifies adolescence as a critical time to address implicit racial bias before it becomes entrenched in adulthood. The broader goals of this project are to elucidate the social-cognitive processes underlying majority adolescents’ implicit racial bias and to design interventions to counteract this bias. These goals align with NICHD’s priority to understand social and cognitive factors related to the development of (biased) reasoning. While implicit bias has negative consequences for minority groups, such bias may also decrease racial majority adolescents’ intergroup contact and relationships, which are critical for developing social-cognitive skills (e.g., cognitive flexibility) that facilitate adaptive adjustment in a multicultural society. The central hypotheses of this study are: (1) adolescents with more exposure to African Americans will have greater social-cognitive skills to individuate (i.e., perceive them as unique individuals) and humanize them (i.e., attribute human mental states), and in turn will develop less implicit racial bias, and (2) directly teaching adolescents to individuate and humanize African American people will reduce implicit bias. The specific aims are: (1) to examine how peers and media influence adolescents’ implicit racial bias through the development of the tendency to individuate and humanize African American people, and (2) to conduct an intervention integrating individuation and humanization interventions to reduce adolescents’ implicit bias in the long-term. Regarding methods, Aim 1 will be a yearlong, three-wave correlational study examining longitudinal links between racial majority adolescents’ a) exposure to African Americans, b) individuation and humanization of African American people, and c) implicit racial bias. Aim 2 will be a 2x2 intervention study (Individuation [yes, no] x Humanization [yes, no]) in which participants will read first-person narratives from African American adolescents and view corresponding photographs; the intervention conditions will vary in whether they promote individuation (by training subjects to differentiate the target African American adolescents) and humanization (e.g., by including emotional stories in the narratives). The study will assess implicit bias 3 months later to examine long-term effects. This project is theoretically and methodologically innovative and is expected to be significant because it will advance the development of empirically-validated strategies to reduce societal racial inequalities. The accompanying three-year postdoctoral training plan will take place predominantly in the psychology department at the University of California, San Diego. The trainee will be provided mentorship from leading psychologists in implicit racial bias research, training in state-of-the-art theoretical and methodological approaches, and a formal postdoctoral training program to launch her independent academic career. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Research indicates that implicit racial bias contributes to societal inequalities in health, wealth, and well-being, yet little is known about how to reduce implicit bias for the long-term. Improving scientific knowledge of how to mitigate implicit bias is critical for attaining a more equitable society that promotes the health of all its citizens. The proposed project investigates how implicit racial bias develops and can be mitigated during adolescence— a developmental period when racial attitudes are highly responsive to social influence and intervention.",Emergence of Implicit Bias during Adolescent Development,10006726,F32HD098777,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Individuation ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Prejudice ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Punishment ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Societies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' consciousness loss ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' mental status ', ' mental state ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Address ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' Advanced Development ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' critical period ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive skill ', ' implicit bias ', ' race bias ', ' racial bias ', ' intervention cost ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F32,2020,64926,0.07286726554805285
"A Digital Intervention for HIV Prevention in Black Adolescent Girls PROJECT SUMMARY Black women are disproportionately diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Black women often contract HIV/STIs through high-risk sex and adolescence is when these behaviors are more common. Furthermore, Black adolescent girls are more affected by HIV/STIs than other demographics of adolescent girls; yet, there are few engaging and effective interventions designed exclusively for them. In fact, many are unaware of their partner HIV/STI status and do not consistently use condoms to protect themselves. Therefore, interventions that counter individual-level risk perception by promoting HIV/STI testing for themselves and their partners and reduce risk behaviors, such as non-condom use, are greatly needed. There is compelling evidence that peers play a significant role in the protection from risk associated with HIV/STIs by providing opportunities to exchange knowledge, influence attitudes, and to develop new behavioral skills. Videogame interventions, which are frequently played with others, can be culturally tailored, provide behavioral skills training, and have demonstrated efficacy in affecting health behaviors related to health promotion. With the growing evidence for the efficacy of videogames in improving health outcomes, it is essential to examine how to harness these technologies to modify behaviors in Black adolescent girls. With funding from the Women’s Health Research at Yale Pilot Program, the Yale’s play2PREVENT Lab developed and pilot tested a theory-based social card game intervention, One Night Stan, which was aimed at increasing partner HIV/STI testing and condom use in young black women aged 18- 24. Preliminary findings of a pilot study conducted with 21 black women aged 18-21 suggest that playing the game can lead to increased self-efficacy and intentions to use condoms and insist that their partners get tested for HIV across time. In terms of gameplay satisfaction, 100% of participants reported that that they would play the game again, 95% liked the way the game looked, 100% enjoyed playing the game, and 100% reported that they would tell their friends to play. Results from this study suggest that One Night Stan is a feasible intervention approach and may be efficacious in helping players develop a pattern of cognitions and motivation that can protect them against the risk of HIV. Together, a team comprised of experts from the Yale Center for Health & Leaning Games will build upon this formative work and pilot data to adapt One Night Stan to a multiplayer videogame for younger target audience of Black adolescent girls. For this proposal, we will evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of One Night Stan at increasing self and partner HIV/STI testing by conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial with 80 young Black adolescent girls ages 14-18. We will also explore the efficacy of the intervention for increasing players’ HIV/STI knowledge and for increasing intentions and attitudes around safer HIV/STI practices. As a multiplayer videogame, the intervention is a compelling framework for Black adolescent girls who constantly interact and are influenced by their peers. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE This project is designed to develop and test a multiplayer videogame intervention for adolescent black girls ages 14-18. The goal of this proposal is to increase HIV/STI self and partner testing and reduce sexual risk behaviors such as non-condom use in order to decrease their risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Because the game will be played with adolescent females and their peers, this project has the potential to spread beyond the individual to influence public health and decrease the number of new cases of HIV/STI.",A Digital Intervention for HIV Prevention in Black Adolescent Girls,10005408,R21HD098031,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired

"Preventing Suicide in African American Adolescents Abstract The aim of this grant application is to test the effectiveness of a culturally-adapted, school- based suicide prevention intervention, delivered by indigenous Rush University social workers (i.e., “intervention social workers”), for low-resourced, urban, African American 9th grade students. Rates of suicide among African American youth have increased substantially in the past 20 years, and suicide is currently one of the leading causes of death among African American adolescents. As such, there is a need for effective, sustainable prevention interventions for these populations. Our study will train intervention social workers to deliver a culturally-adapted, evidence-based coping with stress prevention intervention (i.e., the Adolescent Coping with Stress Course [A-CWS]). Urban African American adolescents who have participated in the A-CWS have demonstrated decreases in suicide risk, as well as decreases in anxiety and increases in several dimensions of adaptive coping (i.e., use of positive coping strategies for problem experiences, positive thinking, depression coping self- efficacy). We aim to demonstrate that indigenous intervention social workers can implement the A-CWS with fidelity and that participants in intervention groups facilitated by indigenous intervention social workers experience increases in levels of adaptive coping. We will examine the extent that interpersonal factors (i.e., thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness) and socio-ecological factors (i.e., community violence exposure, limited neighborhood resources, family dynamics) influence active suicidal ideation. We will test whether these factors influence active suicidal ideation in African American adolescents. Lastly, our study will examine the mechanism by which the A-CWS intervention reduces suicide risk for low-resourced, urban African American adolescents. We will examine the ability of adaptive coping skills, gained through participation in the A-CWS intervention, increase hope and reduce hopelessness. We will then examine the moderating effects of hope and hopelessness on the influence of interpersonal and socio-ecological factors on active suicidal ideation. This translational study has public health implications. It will expand the understanding of mechanisms of change related to suicide risk reduction in urban African American adolescents. It will test a modified version of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide for urban African American adolescents. Lastly, our study will inform the training and monitoring of indigenous mental health professionals to deliver evidence-based prevention interventions for urban African American adolescents; as such, our study will inform the practice of prevention intervention sustainability and dissemination. To examine the effectiveness of an evidence-based and culturally-grounded stress-reduction intervention (i.e., the A-CWS), facilitated by indigenous social workers, to increase adaptive coping and reduce active suicidal ideation in African American 9th graders. This study has broad public health implications and informs procedures for scaling up efficacious, high quality, and culturally grounded suicide prevention programs and best practices for the prevention of suicide among African American adolescents.",Preventing Suicide in African American Adolescents,9996789,R01MH118382,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Chicago ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Family dynamics ', ' family structure/dynamics ', ' Female ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Health ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Social Workers ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' No hope for the future ', ' hopelessness ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' interest ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' 9th grade ', ' high school freshman ', ' ninth grade ', ' Prevention ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Indigenous ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Study Section ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' suicide rate ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' Minority ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' coping ', ' translational study ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' reduce suicidality ', ' reduce suicide ', ' reducing suicidality ', ' reducing suicide ', ' service providers ', ' service delivery ', ' stress reduction ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' social interventions ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIMH,DE PAUL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1392858,0.0883128655556045
"mHealth Intervention via Mentors: Preventing Substance Use, Sexual Risk and Violence among Inner City Youth through Technology-Enhanced Mentoring PROJECT SUMMARY This K01 proposal, “mHealth Intervention via Mentors: Preventing Substance Use, Sexual Risk, and Violence among Inner City Baltimore Youth through Technology-Enhanced Mentoring,” addresses two fields of study relevant to adolescent health that deserve further attention, particularly in how they can intersect to improve public health: youth mentoring and mobile health (mHealth) prevention interventions. Adolescents growing up in low-income urban areas such as Baltimore are at particularly high risk for unhealthy practices such as substance use, sexual risk, and engagement in violence. For adolescents who lack socially protective resources such as parents, attentive teachers, or community networks, mentors can play a significant role in helping to reduce stress, prevent negative health behaviors, and model positive health behaviors. However, little is known about the pathways by which mentee health behavior change occurs, especially for the prevention of substance use, how matched mentors can effectively communicate health promotion messages, or how mHealth technology might be leveraged to enhance existing mentoring models. Utilizing knowledge and training gained through this award in the areas of adolescent substance use, mHealth interventions, and analysis of dyadic and “big” social media and smartphone data, the goal of the proposed study is to develop a prevention intervention in the form of a smartphone application (app), as well as training materials for using the app, to enhance existing mentoring models for highly vulnerable African American male adolescents in urban Baltimore. The training, professional development, and pilot data gained under this award will allow me to propose an R01 to conduct a naturalistic study or randomized controlled trial to measure effect sizes in the reduction of substance use and related health risk behaviors among mentored adolescent males. Support under a K award and the linked career development experiences will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on a new area of expertise—substance use prevention with urban American youth using mHealth—and to learn the skills required for successfully pursing NIH research funding. My long-term career goal is to answer the following research questions: 1) How can mentoring help improve health outcomes for at-risk adolescents and reduce health disparities in adulthood? and 2) How can mHealth be used in prevention intervention with this population? Fully understanding how to set up a systematic research program that intersects the fields of youth mentoring and effective mHealth intervention has great potential to lead me towards an innovative and productive independent research career in a new area. My intermediate career goals under this training grant are to focus work locally with African American adolescent males in Baltimore City, understand how technology-enhanced mentoring can serve as a universal prevention tool for urban male adolescents, build capacity to analyze dyadic data and data produced by social media and smartphone applications, and to develop collaborations with leading investigators in substance use prevention, youth mentoring, and mHealth research. PROJECT NARRATIVE For adolescents who lack socially protective resources such as parents, attentive teachers, or community networks, mentors can play a significant role in helping to reduce stress, prevent negative health behaviors, and model positive health behaviors. However, little is known about the pathways by which mentee health behavior change occurs, especially for the prevention of substance use, how matched mentors can effectively communicate health promotion messages, or how mobile health (mHealth) technology might be leveraged to enhance existing mentoring models.

"Speaking Their Language: Using Social Media and Texting to Create an Adolescent-Centered Approach to Healthy Weight Gain During Pregnancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tammy Chang, MD, MPH, MS is a family physician and junior clinical investigator focused on reducing obesity among adolescent mothers and their children. Dr. Chang's long-term career objective is to reduce health disparities among low-income adolescent mothers using tailored eHealth technologies. The objective of this K23 mentored career development award includes a 5-year plan for training and research activities that will provide the skills and experiences needed to become a successful independent investigator. RESEARCH CONTEXT: The United States (US) has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the developed world; the majority of pregnant adolescents gain excess weight during pregnancy. Excess pregnancy weight gain has a significant negative impact on the health of the adolescent mother, increases the risk of dangerous complications during delivery, and contributes to long-term obesity for both mother and child. In recognition of this important population health problem, both the IOM and AHRQ have identified the development of interventions targeting excess pregnancy weight gain as a major research priority. Compared to adults, relatively little is known about pregnancy weight gain among adolescents. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand adolescents' perceptions of and knowledge about pregnancy weight gain, so that researchers can customize interventions and make them relevant to the pregnant adolescent. The short-term goal of this proposal is to acquire the requisite skills to develop an adolescent-centered tailored eHealth intervention to reduce excess pregnancy weight gain. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Determine which US pregnant adolescents (aged ≤21 years) are at high risk for significant excess pregnancy weight gain; 2) Identify the baselin knowledge, beliefs, and factors that influence excess pregnancy weight gain among adolescents; and 3) Design and test a scalable healthy diet and exercise eHealth intervention tailored to at-risk pregnant adolescents. RESEARCH PLAN: To accomplish these aims, Dr. Chang will conduct analyses using nationally representative data from the Fragile Families and Wellbeing Study; carry out social media mining and corresponding qualitative interviews with pregnant and postpartum adolescents; and design, implement, and evaluate an adolescent- centered and tailored eHealth (tailored text-messaging) intervention. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Chang will broaden her knowledge of advanced statistical methods using a large nationally representative dataset; develop skills in mining and analyzing online social media data; acquire expertise in designing, implementing, and evaluating scalable interventions tailored to pregnant adolescents; and obtain experience in translating research findings into clinically relevant policies and practices. Dr. Chang's career development goals will be supported through close mentorship from an interdisciplinary team; guidance from an expert advisory panel; advanced didactic course work; attendance at professional meetings and workshops; participation in seminars and journal clubs; guidance in manuscript preparation and grant proposal development for projects arising from the research she conducts as part of this proposal; and implementing her research plan. This training will directly contribute to Dr. Chang's goal of addressing a vital intergenerational problem of excess pregnancy weight gain among at-risk adolescents, as well as the subsequent submission of a successful R01 application. ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Chang's unique resources include a dedicated and accomplished multi-disciplinary mentorship team with whom she has previously collaborated; the outstanding research infrastructure at the University of Michigan and Department of Family Medicine with a particular emphasis on supporting junior investigators; and numerous advanced didactic courses and seminars provided by several distinct academic units at the University of Michigan. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The US has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the developed world, and most pregnant adolescents in the US gain excess weight during pregnancy. Excess weight gain during pregnancy not only has a significant negative impact on the health of the adolescent mother, it increases the risk of dangerous complications during delivery, and contributes to long- term obesity for both mother and child. The overarching goal of this proposal is to promote healthy weight gain among pregnant adolescents by leveraging technologies adolescents use frequently, including online social media and

"Reducing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption among young adults: A point-of-selection experiment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of adolescent and adult obesity is higher than it has ever been in the U.S, driving population risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Robust evidence indicates that consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) increases the risk of developing obesity. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Academy of Medicine have called for broad action to reduce SSB consumption, little is known about how to effectively do so in the age group that consumes the greatest amount of SSBs— older adolescents and young adults. One promising and potentially scalable approach is the use of SSB health warning labels. Although the effect of warning labels on SSB consumption has not yet been studied, warning labels have successfully been used to curb smoking, and in recent online experiments, were found to reduce hypothetical selection of SSBs. This study proposes to use qualitative methods and a formative experiment to develop a legally viable and salient SSB warning label format for adolescents and young adults. Then, a quasi- experimental design will test the impact of a prominent front-of-dispenser SSB warning label on university students’ beverage consumption, comparing outcomes in an intervention cafeteria to those in a control cafeteria. The college setting provides a feasible means of reaching close to half of all 18-to-24 year olds in the U.S. I am pursuing the NIDDK K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to fill critical training gaps in (1) the design, conduct, and analysis of intervention studies and (2) understanding of factors driving consumer decision-making. This award will build upon my advanced training in nutritional epidemiology and development of measures to assess dietary intake and food environments. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator who will reduce the prevalence of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases by identifying a spectrum of scalable and effective interventions that can “nudge” consumers toward healthier dietary choices. The skills I seek to obtain will be critical in achieving this goal. My detailed training plan includes formal coursework at UC Berkeley and UCSF, mentored experience, meetings, seminars, and directed readings. The research component of this project will provide opportunities to integrate new knowledge into practical research experience. Together, the training and protected time provided by the K01 award, combined with the rich collaborative environment and strong institutional support at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, will facilitate my transition into an independent investigator who can successfully compete for R01 funding. It will also provide the means to help me become a leader in the development and testing of scalable food environment and policy interventions that will reduce population risk of diet-related chronic diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE The prevalence of adolescent and adult obesity is higher than it has ever been in the U.S., and strong evidence indicates that sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are a major contributor to unhealthy weight gain and type 2 diabetes. Little is known about scalable approaches to reduce SSB consumption in older adolescents and adults, but a promising approach used in tobacco control that has been unstudied for SSB consumption is product warning labels. The proposed study will test the impact of SSB health warning labels on SSB consumption among adolescents and young adults in a cafeteria setting, which, if found to be effective, may be an approach

"Development and feasibility of an online, group intervention for transition-age youth with ASD to promote healthy relationships: Career enhancement for an adolescent health intervention researcher Project Summary This career enhancement award will facilitate the transition of an established, federally-funded adolescent relationship health intervention researcher to the field of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research. There are now approximately 450,000 youth with ASD between the ages of 16-24 years old in the U.S., and 50,000 more turning 18 each year. There is a tremendous need for evidence-based interventions for transition-age youth and young adults with ASD to promote healthy peer relationships. Autism is characterized by difficulty in social relations, and many individuals with ASD struggle to establish, maintain and manage peer relationships during the transition to adulthood. Moreover, individuals with ASD can experience high rates of peer victimization, including dating and sexual violence victimization. Evidence-based, cost-effective interventions that support the development of healthy peer relationships are urgently needed. The proposed training and research plan will equip the applicant with the skills, experience and collaborative relationships necessary to launch a line of research to evaluate the impact of psychosocial interventions to promote healthy relationships for transition- age youth with ASD. Training objectives are: (1) ASD topical knowledge, (2) evidence-based intervention development for transition-age youth with ASD, and (3) statistical methods for clinical trials and for analyses consistent with the NIMH experimental therapeutics model. Mentors include experts in research with ASD transition-age youth and young adults, and intervention development for ASD. The research will achieve two specific aims. Aim 1 is to conduct formative research that will inform the content of the new Healthy Peer Relationships on the Spectrum (HEARTS) online group intervention, and improve measurement instruments. Aim 1 will be achieved through qualitative research with 15 youth with ASD (ages 16-22 years old, average or high IQ), 15 parents, and 15 research and practitioner experts (N=45). Aim 2 will assess the feasibility of implementation of the HEARTS intervention and intervention research procedures. Aim 2 will be achieved through a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which N=48 youth with ASD, ages 16-22 years old, average or high IQ, will be randomized to either the HEARTS intervention or a comparison condition. Quantitative assessments will be made at baseline and 3 months, and qualitative data will enrich findings. RCT outcomes are feasibility-related: feasibility of recruitment, delivering the intervention, retaining participants, fidelity, burden of assessments, acceptability, and human subjects issues. As per the experimental therapeutics model, target mechanisms and clinical endpoints have been identified. While the goal of the pilot RCT is not to test hypotheses, the research will test the feasibility of assessing clinical endpoints including depression, social anxiety, and experiencing psychological, physical, and sexual aggression and/or stalking. The research will yield preliminary psychometric information on measures. A targeted enrollment scheme will ensure that research participants are racially/ethnically diverse, and of all genders. Project Narrative This award will enable an established researcher to transition to autism research. The research project will entail the development and preliminary testing of an online group intervention to promote healthy peer relationships for transition-age youth with ASD.","Development and

"Early Intervention for Suicide Risk among Immigrant Youth PROJECT SUMMARY Background. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-24 year olds in the United States, yet there is a dearth of evidence-based prevention programs that explicitly address suicide risk factors prior to the onset of suicide attempts. First and second generation immigrant youth comprise 25% of the U.S. population under 18 and experience specific risk factors for suicidal ideation and attempts. This includes family conflict exacerbated by differing cultural expectations between parents and children and disruptions to parent-child communication. At the same time, family-based preventive interventions focused on enhancing family protective factors show promise for reducing later suicide risk. Research Strategy. The present study focuses on developing and testing a family-based preventive intervention for suicide risk through three interrelated projects. These are: 1) Conducting longitudinal analyses of two existing datasets to identify how social support assets (e.g., experiences of family, peer, and community support) buffer suicide risk for adolescents at high risk of suicidal behavior, and examining how these associations may vary by gender and racial/ethnic group; 2) Utilizing intervention mapping and qualitative data to develop and refine a new preventive intervention, the Early Intervention for Suicide Risk among Immigrant Youth; and 3) Pilot testing the early intervention with first and second generation immigrant Latino/a adolescents screening positive for suicide risk and their families. 40 families will be randomized to the intervention or to usual care. Feasibility, acceptability, and impact on the intervention targets will be assessed. Training Plan. In coordination with the research plan, Dr. Alvarez will pursue training in the following three areas: 1) methodological approaches relevant to development and evaluation of preventive interventions targeting low base rate behaviors; 2) innovative approaches to assessment of suicide risk in clinical research contexts; and 3) design and testing of prevention programs delivered in healthcare, school, and community settings, with a particular focus on suicide prevention. Her research will be based at the Disparities Research Unit in Massachusetts General Hospital, a Harvard Medical School affiliated, major medical center providing access to an abundance of clinical research resources and training opportunities. Mentorship. The project’s mentorship team provides a range of complementary expertise relevant to the research and training aims of this proposal. Dr. Alvarez’s primary mentor, Dr. Alegria, is an expert in health disparities and health services research with extensive experience in mentoring early career investigators, including K awardees. Her co-mentor Dr. Wyman provides expertise in youth suicide prevention and prevention research, and co-mentor Dr. Shrout provides expertise in statistical modeling of longitudinal data and analysis of clinical trial outcomes. A team of advisors provides additional expertise in the epidemiology of depression and suicidal behaviors (Dr. Roberts), adaptive testing for mental health assessment (Dr. Gibbons), family-based preventive intervention design and evaluation (Dr. Pantin), and clinical trials for depression and related disorders (Dr. Alpert). Candidate. Dr. Alvarez is an early career researcher trained in school and child clinical psychology who is completing NIMH-funded postdoctoral training in health disparities and mental health services research focused on culturally diverse populations. This K23 project would provide the foundation to launch her career as a clinical researcher specializing in suicide prevention, with a particular focus on interventions addressing the needs of immigrant youth and on family-based preventive interventions delivered in healthcare and community settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among adolescents, with rates increasing between 1999 and 2014. Family-based preventive interventions demonstrate promise for reducing suicide risk among adolescents, and are particularly relevant for addressing suicide risk factors specific to immigrant youth, who comprise one-fourth of the U.S. population under 18. The development of an effective preventive intervention for the immigrant youth population would make critical contributions to the reduction of suicide rates nationwide.",Early Intervention for

"Feasibility of a multi-level school intervention for LGBTQ youth ABSTRACT The goal of this proposed R21 grant is to test the feasibility of a theoretically informed, school-based intervention for LGBT adolescents (Proud & Empowered; P&E). LGBT adolescents experience disparities in behavioral health outcomes compared to their heterosexual peers. For example, LGBT adolescents are 3 to 4 times more likely to meet criteria for an internalizing disorder and 2 to 5 times more likely to meet criteria for externalizing disorders than their heterosexual counterparts. This is commonly attributed to minority stressors, including victimization in schools, that is associated with poor school climate. Our intervention seeks to address these disparate behavioral health problems through use of a novel multi-level school-based prevention intervention. Our goal will be achieved by completing two specific aims: 1) Assess the feasibility (i.e., recruitment, enrollment, fidelity of service delivery, satisfaction, safety, and retention) and participant-level efficacy of the intervention in a delayed intervention RCT with four schools. 2) Obtain preliminary estimates of school-wide intervention effects on (a) reporting of minority stress and behavioral health outcomes among all LGBT students and (b) changing climate (norms, attitudes, beliefs, bullying behaviors toward LGBT youth) among all students. We expect that (H1) LGBT students in schools where the P&E intervention is delivered will report fewer minority stress experiences and fewer behavioral health symptoms as compared to LGBT students in control schools, even if they did not participate in the 10-week P&E intervention themselves; and (H2) students in schools where the P&E intervention is delivered will report improvements in school climate toward LGBT students as compared to students in control schools. This innovative R21 application brings together a team of nationally recognized minority stress and prevention science experts and responds to a nationally established public health need for research from the National Academy of Medicine, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have proposed to test a minority stress-informed, developmentally appropriate intervention for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) adolescents and their schools. If successful, this project will provide direction for a larger randomized control trial on the effectiveness of this intervention, and participation will address the behavioral health concerns found in this vulnerable population.",Feasibility of a multi-level school intervention for LGBTQ youth,9959464,R21MD013971,"['Academy ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Students ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Administrator ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' bully ', ' bullying ', ' Source ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' physical attack ', ' physical assault ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Drops ', ' Ally ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Teenagers ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' peer victimization ', ' Minority ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' control trial ', ' intervention effect ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' school district ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' recruit ', ' service delivery ', ' LGBTQ ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2020,209340,0.03513061794475742
"Adolescence to adulthood: Factors influencing trajectories of suicide ideation and attempt among sexual minorities PROJECT SUMMARY The momentum for this study is supported by the need to understand how suicidal trajectories present from early adolescence into adulthood among a community-based, nationally representative sample. While longitudinal research among adolescent clinical samples has contributed to the literature, they often do not follow adolescents into adulthood and/or include particular higher-risk groups that include sexual minorities. Clinical samples also include participants who have already disclosed their suicidal behaviors to professionals. Adolescents utilize mental health professionals and disclose to trusted adults less than adults, which arguably heighten risk for suicidal behaviors. Yet no study has tracked help seeking behaviors for sexual minority adolescents experiencing distress. Furthermore, longitudinally, a representative sample of suicidal behaviors over the crucial developmental period of adolescence to young adulthood. This study contributes to the literature and aids in public health efforts, as these groups have not reported significant decreases in suicidal behavior in the past 25 years. The study will focus on a salient protective mechanism: community messaging. We propose that the heterogeneity of suicidal trajectories will not only help explain suicidal behavior disparities, but will aid in tailoring prevention initiatives based upon the onset of symptomology. This proposed work will create profiles that reflect the variation of suicidal behaviors, based on four independent levels of suicidal risk (1) no suicidal behaviors, (2) suicidal ideation yet no attempts, (3) suicide attempts (4) suicide attempts resulting in medical treatment. This work will examine whether particular profiles not only describe how specific subgroups are at a heightened risk in early adolescence, but also elucidate why some might be chronically suicidal and while others might first present suicidal behaviors later in life. The proposed study will use secondary analysis of the Add Health dataset to 1) describe the longitudinal patterns and progression of suicidal behaviors; 2) examine how social relationships and behavioral health are related to the escalation and de-escalation of suicidal behaviors, and 3) observe the heterogeneity of sexual minority presentations in these suicidal behavior trajectories. Profiles will be identified through latent transition analysis. The proposed study will produce recommendations for how pediatricians and other health care providers, as well as educators and community leaders, particularly in the context of gatekeeping and understanding suicidal risk factors, can support parents and other trusted adults in communicating effectively with their children about suicidal behaviors by (1) identifying which particular sexual minority subgroups are at the most need for upstream prevention messaging; and (2) targeting specific social relationships to capitalize on for help-seeking promotion during times of distress. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority disparities are consistently found among adolescents engaging in suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

"Cardiometabolic Health in Adolescents of South Asian Ancestry - the CHAriSmA study Project Summary/Abstract South Asians (SA), the fastest growing major ethnic group in the U.S., are also at greater type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk at relatively lower body mass index (BMI) compared to those of European and African ancestry. The mechanism(s) underlying this increased cardiometabolic risk remain undefined. We are submitting this research proposal in response to an NIH program announcement (PA-17-021) requesting proposals addressing health disparities in NIDDK diseases. The increased cardiometabolic risk in SA Americans represent an understudied and disparate risk. Mostly adult, associative studies performed outside the U.S. indicate that SA have higher % body fat, visceral adiposity, and abdominal adiposity for a given BMI than other ethnic groups. These studies have also found increased insulin resistance and dyslipidemia as well as decreased insulin-mediated glucose disposal (inversely proportional to visceral fat) and β-cell function in SA adults. We propose to study SA adolescents, in order to elucidate early mechanistic changes underlying their increased cardiometabolic risk. Given the unique fat distribution of SA, we propose to define ectopic fat deposition and test for altered fat metabolism and β-cell insulin secretion in SA adolescents in the U.S. We will use cutting-edge, innovative techniques, including MRI/MRS, mathematical modeling of free fatty acid (FFA) kinetics, and the glucose-potentiated arginine test (GPA) to measure insulin secretory capacity, methods not previously used in SA adolescents. We have assembled a highly experienced, multi-institutional (CNMC, CHOP, NIH), and multi-disciplinary team with a track record of successful collaboration, to perform a cross-sectional study of 12-21 year old adolescents and young adults of SA ancestry (n=50), BMI ≥ 85%ile, compared to adolescents of European ancestry (White) (n=50) and African American (AA) ancestry (n=50) of comparable age, sex, and BMI %ile. AA individuals are known to also have increased cardiometabolic risk but have decreased visceral adiposity, making them a unique comparison group. Aims: 1. To examine ancestry-related differences in body fat distribution (by MRI/MRS), FFA flux (by 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test and Minimal Model of fatty acid kinetics), and to compare the relationships between visceral adiposity and FFA flux among ancestral groups. 2. To examine ancestry-related differences in β-cell insulin secretory capacity (by GPA), and compare the relationship between FFA flux and insulin secretory capacity among groups. 3. To compare CVD and T2DM risk factors and vascular end organ injury (aortic pulse wave velocity) among the three groups, and test for ancestry-related differences in the relationships between FFA flux and cardiometabolic risk profile. Exploratory Aim: to compare adipocyte-derived exosomal microRNAs involved in insulin signaling among the groups, and measure their association with β-cell insulin secretory capacity, for hypothesis generation. Thus, this proposal will investigate whether associations between ectopic fat, FFA flux, and β-cell secretion vary by ancestry to impact cardiometabolic risk, with the expectation that this may eventually lead to ancestry-specific treatment options. PROJECT NARRATIVE South Asians (SA) (those with ancestral roots in India, Pakistan, the Maldives, Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka) are the fastest growing major ethnic group in the U.S., nearly doubling in numbers between 2000 and 2013. SA also have increased type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk at relatively lower body mass index compared to other ethnicities, but the mechanism(s) underlying this increased risk are not known. This study will investigate the possible connections between altered body fat distribution, fatty acid metabolism, and insulin secretion in SA compared to those of African American and European ancestries, to look for differences which in the future, may have implications for ancestry-specific treatments of disease.",Cardiometabolic Health in Adolescents of South Asian Ancestry - the
