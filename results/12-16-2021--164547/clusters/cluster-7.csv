"Northern Plains Center for Behavioral Research Translation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed Northern Plains Center for Research Translation (NPCRT) is to create a multidisciplinary, integrated program of clinical and translational research at the University of North Dakota that serves at-risk rural populations across the region. The NPCRT's objective is to develop, test, and disseminate interventions and best practices that address often-preventable behaviorally mediated physiologic disorders such as obesity and diabetes, neuro-degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and behavioral disorders such as depression and suicide. These diseases disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged people in our region-American Indians, the elderly rural poor, women and children. The NPCRT will serve investigators at all stages of career development by offering graduate degrees in the clinical and translational sciences, and provide research training. The specific aims of this CTSA project are to create: 1) plans for the development of clinical and translational research as a discipline at UNO; 2) plans for research education, training, and career development; 3) a needs analysis to determine   the expertise and resources that the CTSA will develop and offer; 4) a plan for CTSA organization,   administration, governance, and evaluation; 5) a plan for CTSA senior leadership selection; 6) a plan to   assure adequate space and facilities; 7) plans for firm commitments for local funding and institutional   support; 8) a plan to assure scientific quality; and 9) a plan to develop collaborations and dissemination. Our transformational vision is to plan an innovative, distributed, rural CTSA model driven by the health needs of our people. Obesity has skyrocketed-62% of ND adults are now overweight or obese. Type 2 diabetes prevalence in ND jumped 72% from 1994 to 2003. Neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's) are increasingly prevalent. American Indian youth in ND die by suicide at a rate 429% higher than that for young whites. Development and dissemination of new interventions and best practices is needed to reduce morbidity and mortality from these diseases. We must address these health care needs, as well as the disparities in health status that exist between these vulnerable groups and others, thus our appeal for funding to plan a Northern Plains Center for Research Translation.          ",Northern Plains Center for Behavioral Research Translation,7216090,P20RR023489,"['behavioral medicine ', ' training ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' health science research ', ' nursing ', ' psychology ', ' Native American ', ' science education ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' NIH Roadmap Initiative tag ', ' ']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA,P20,2006,202489,0.10748575854265076
"Planning Community, Clinic and Academic Training to Reduce Black Belt Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than two decades ago, DHHS released the Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health, documenting many health disparities and catalyzing federal agencies and others into action. Tragically, disparities still pervade the American landscape. The days of doing research for research sake are over. In order to identify and ameliorate the health disparities of Alabama Black Belt residents, it is our responsibility as clinicians and researchers to move our science from theory to practice and from the laboratory bench to the community. Our goal is to re-engineer clinical research for the sake of primary care so we can speed new treatments to our rural citizens and improve their quality of life. It is also imperative that we not only include the community as participants in our research but as partners in our endeavors to eliminate health disparities in these communities. The ultimate goal of this proposed effort is to develop plans for the content, administration, governance, and evaluation of an institutional Clinical and Translational   Science Award focusing on primary care and health disparities. This effort will build upon the infrastructure already created by the Alabama Institute for Rural Health Research and its associated Center of Excellence, which is supported by Project EXPORT, an ongoing research project funded by the NCMHD. In an effort to achieve this goal, the following specific aims will be undertaken: Conduct a needs assessment of the current state of resources, skills, knowledge, and abilities with regard to the establishment and implementation of an Institutional Clinical and Translational Science program; 2: Initiate a strategic planning process, that includes community representatives, primary health care providers, researchers, and academic administrators that takes into account the ever-changing external and internal issues that impact and shape the establishment, implementation, and continued development of an Institutional Clinical Translational Science program; 3: Develop, design, and submit an application for an Institutional Clinical and Translational Science Award. Accomplishment of these aims will allow for the development of such an Award and with this structure in place, we can begin the process of re-engineering clinical and translational research with the goal of improving primary care and eliminating health disparities experienced by ethnic and racial minorities living in Alabama's rural Black Belt region, the southeast, and beyond.          ","Planning Community, Clinic and Academic Training to Reduce Black Belt Disparities",7215419,P20RR023412,"['biomedical resource ', ' training ', ' health care quality ', ' community health service ', ' patient care management ', ' primary care physician ', ' hospital community relations ', ' human subject ', ' information dissemination ', ' African American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' focus group ', ' rural health ', ' NIH Roadmap Initiative tag ', ' ']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,P20,2006,213812,0.1730047439583871

"The Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (VICTR) KL2 Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) has a long and distinguished history of advancing the science and practice of medicine and preparing scholars for clinical and translational research. The Medical Center's 44 NIH institutional training grants and training grants funded through other federal agencies attest to the breadth, skill, and commitment of our faculty to developing future leaders in clinical investigation. The Vanderbilt General Clinical Research Center (GCRC), one of the oldest and largest in the country, has been an important training ground for many of our nation's leading clinical and translational researchers. In 1999, Vanderbilt obtained K30 funding to create a formal curriculum for the multi-disciplinary research training of clinical investigators at VUMC. That funding resulted in a new degree program¿the Master of Science in Clinical Investigation (MSCI)¿for training clinical researchers in translational research, including mechanisms of human disease, therapeutic interventions, clinical trials, and the development of new technologies. The K30 award also allowed the expansion of the existing Vanderbilt Master of Public Health (MPH) program for clinical investigators directed toward epidemiologic/behavioral research or outcomes/health services research and the translation of medical discoveries into practice. In the same year, Vanderbilt and Meharry Medical College (MMC), a historically black institution, established the Vanderbilt-Meharry Alliance to promote educational collaboration and increased research in Health Disparities. As highlighted throughout this application, the Alliance has allowed for the sharing of resources for training clinical and translational scientists. In 2002, this collaboration resulted in R25 funding of the Clinical Research and Career Development program at Meharry. One year prior to the funding of the K30, Vanderbilt created the Medical Scholars Program (MSP) to allow select medical students to spend one year engaged in focused research. Development of the program in 2004 provided all medical students with a concentrated experience in clinical science or public health promotion. At the same time, Vanderbilt, recognizing the importance of protected time in the development of successful physician-scientists, established the Vanderbilt Physician-Scientist Development Program (VPSD) to provide salary support to newly appointed assistant professor physicians with significant research experience to receive additional mentored investigative training. In 2002, NCRR K12 funding of the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Scholars (VCRS) program provided trainees in clinical and translational science with a similar mentored research apprenticeship integrated with the didactic training of the MSCI and MPH programs.

"Institutional Clinical and Translational Science Award (UW-Madison) A. Summary and Objectives The overall aim of the Research Education and Career Development (REC) Core of the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) is to develop a diverse, multidisciplinary, clinical and translational research workforce capable of accelerating the translation of research findings into evidence-based policies and practices that improve the health of individual patients and all populations in the United States. This goal is consonant with the NIH Roadmap and the recent transformation of the UW School of Medicine into an integrated School of Medicine and Public Health. The REC Core will capitalize on the momentum at UWMadison to: 1) advance multidisciplinary collaborations; 2) implement new curricula that complement existing research education programs; 3) establish and evaluate mentor-training programs; 4) design interventions that build on the career development scholarship of our faculty; and 5) transform institutional culture to increase the participation and advancement of women and underrepresented minority researchers in the academic enterprise. To achieve these goals we will pursue the following Objectives: Objective 1: Create a menu of educational and career development opportunities with multiple portals of entry and varying levels of intensity to accommodate the needs of all learners; build activities around six core competencies in clinical investigation and six core competencies in teamwork. Objective 2: Launch a new cross-college MS/PhD in clinical investigation to complete a menu of graduate degree and certificate programs in clinical or translational research. Objective 3: Move conceptually and programmatically from independent training programs (CTSA K12, CTSA T32, individual K-awards) to ICTR Trainees and Scholars, who are recruited and selected through a uniform process; matched with the appropriate funding sources according to their discipline and stage of career development; and provided appropriate educational opportunities, career support, and well-trained mentors to support their success. Objective 4: Increase the gender and ethnic/racial diversity of future academic leaders by: 1) coordinating minority recruitment across all UW Madison T32s; 2) assisting Pis in obtaining minority supplements to their NIH IRQ 1s; 3) emphasizing opportunities for research on health disparities1; 4) establishing a Minority Scholars Program; 5) including diversity training in professional development; and 6) piloting and evaluating programs to assist young investigators in balancing personal and professional worklife. Pursuing these objectives is essential to strengthen the educational and career development programs that are currently offered at UW and to embrace a more comprehensive approach to training clinical and translational investigators. The programs developed to meet these objectives are founded upon the following principles: ¿ Build on local strengths and multidisciplinary culture ¿ Take an evidence-based approach to education, career development, and institutional transformation by applying research from adult education, social and organizational sciences whenever possible ¿ Incorporate gender and ethnic/racial issues as they apply to all programmatic elements, including recruitment, retention, career development and research on health disparities ¿ View the ICTR as a ""living laboratory"" evaluating interventions and re-directing resources accordingly The objectives for the REC Core are so intertwined that they are approached in a comprehensive manner throughout the section, with many of the initiatives serving as action items for more than one objective. Hence, unlike many of the other sections, action items pursuant to a single objective are not described.

"Institutional Clinical and Translational Science Award (UW-Madison) A. Summary and Objectives The overall aim of the Research Education and Career Development (REC) Core of the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) is to develop a diverse, multidisciplinary, clinical and translational research workforce capable of accelerating the translation of research findings into evidence-based policies and practices that improve the health of individual patients and all populations in the United States. This goal is consonant with the NIH Roadmap and the recent transformation of the UW School of Medicine into an integrated School of Medicine and Public Health. The REC Core will capitalize on the momentum at UWMadison to: 1) advance multidisciplinary collaborations; 2) implement new curricula that complement existing research education programs; 3) establish and evaluate mentor-training programs; 4) design interventions that build on the career development scholarship of our faculty; and 5) transform institutional culture to increase the participation and advancement of women and underrepresented minority researchers in the academic enterprise. To achieve these goals we will pursue the following Objectives: Objective 1: Create a menu of educational and career development opportunities with multiple portals of entry and varying levels of intensity to accommodate the needs of all learners; build activities around six core competencies in clinical investigation and six core competencies in teamwork. Objective 2: Launch a new cross-college MS/PhD in clinical investigation to complete a menu of graduate degree and certificate programs in clinical or translational research. Objective 3: Move conceptually and programmatically from independent training programs (CTSA K12, CTSA T32, individual K-awards) to ICTR Trainees and Scholars, who are recruited and selected through a uniform process; matched with the appropriate funding sources according to their discipline and stage of career development; and provided appropriate educational opportunities, career support, and well-trained mentors to support their success. Objective 4: Increase the gender and ethnic/racial diversity of future academic leaders by: 1) coordinating minority recruitment across all UW Madison T32s; 2) assisting Pis in obtaining minority supplements to their NIH IRQ 1s; 3) emphasizing opportunities for research on health disparities1; 4) establishing a Minority Scholars Program; 5) including diversity training in professional development; and 6) piloting and evaluating programs to assist young investigators in balancing personal and professional worklife. Pursuing these objectives is essential to strengthen the educational and career development programs that are currently offered at UW and to embrace a more comprehensive approach to training clinical and translational investigators. The programs developed to meet these objectives are founded upon the following principles: ¿ Build on local strengths and multidisciplinary culture ¿ Take an evidence-based approach to education, career development, and institutional transformation by applying research from adult education, social and organizational sciences whenever possible ¿ Incorporate gender and ethnic/racial issues as they apply to all programmatic elements, including recruitment, retention, career development and research on health disparities ¿ View the ICTR as a ""living laboratory"" evaluating interventions and re-directing resources accordingly The objectives for the REC Core are so intertwined that they are approached in a comprehensive manner throughout the section, with many of the initiatives serving as action items for more than one objective.

"Washington University Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences (KL2) Washington University (WU) currently has successful K12, K30, T32 and Doris Duke clinical research training programs which were originally completely separate grants. We propose to transform these programs into the backbone of a new Center for Clinical and Translational Research Training (CCTRT). The CCTRT will be a new multi-institutional, multidisciplinary training program with dedicated space in the new Institute of Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS). The mission of the CCTRT is to provide outstanding clinical and translational research training for Washington University (WU) and its regional partners. This will be accomplished by integrating and enhancing existing training programs, developing new clinical and translational courses, promoting multidisciplinary team training, developing new career development programs and providing improved evaluation and tracking for all training programs. This transformation will be aided by the development of a new Education Committee, a new Council of NIH-Funded Training Programs and reorganizing the K12 Multidisciplinary Advisory Committee to oversee all the clinical research training programs. The CCTRT will support faculty, mentors and trainees by enhancing multidisciplinary research opportunities, providing new training and career development resources, fostering career development skills and promoting extensive interactions between faculty, mentors, and trainees. In 2006 we began integrating the K12, K30, T32 and Doris Duke Programs and moved into newly remodeled space as proposed in our initial CTSA application. The WU K12, K30 and T32 are funded through 2010 but can only be renewed as part a CTSA program and so we are resubmitting our application to continue, expand and transform our outstanding clinical and translational training programs through the CTSA. The new CCTRT will serve as the academic home for research training for the ICTS. The CCTRT will build several new research training programs including: ¿ A PhD program in clinical investigation, ¿ A training program for research nurses, coordinators and assistants, ¿ A series of new pediatric clinical research training programs (Program Function 2.11) and ¿ In collaboration with other CTSA Program Functions we will help develop new translational research curriculum

"Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (KL2) In response to the national effort to develop, improve, and deliver clinical and translational science, the leadership of Emory University challenged both faculty and the administration to transform clinical and translational research within the University and its numerous components and affiliates. With ongoing collaborations in heath-care, education, and interdisciplinary research, Emory also chose to engage two of its close academic partners in metropolitan Atlanta - Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) and Georgia Institute of Technology (GA Tech) to form the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (Atlanta-CTSI). This strategic multi-institutional alliance offered compelling and unique advantages. Emory is one of the nation's leading healthcare and academic research institutions, ranking 19th nationally in NIH funded research; GA Tech is a national leader in biomedical engineering and the application of innovative systems engineering to health care solutions; and MSM is a historically black medical school recognized as a national leader in expanding the ethnic diversity of biomedical research, dedicated to community engagement in efforts to eliminate health disparities and serving as a pipeline for training minority investigators. The established partnerships and diverse faculty enable the Atlanta-CTSI to combine strong clinical, translational, training and basic discovery programs at Emory with the health disparities, training and community outreach focus of MSM together with the engineering and bioinformatics achievements of GA Tech. The planning efforts also led to the creation of a new and innovative pediatric clinical and translational research program and a partnership with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, new partnerships with the emerging Georgia biotechnology community and with Kaiser Permanente, and the further development of partnerships with state sponsored agencies (Georgia Research Alliance) and with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Atlanta-CTSI is a model designed to harness the scientific, technological, and clinical advantages of these institutions around the major aims of discovery, training, and community engagement to create a new city wide home for clinical and translational research. Other new programs resulting from the synergistic partnership include an innovative pilot projects program PiCo-TraCS, integrated clinical interactions and biomedical informatics networks (CIN and BIN), creation of a technology ""pipeline"" and Academy for Translational Methods Development, a bioinformatics Leapfrog initiative, a facilitating Office of Human Studies Research, creative K30/K12 and T32 programs, and an outstanding community engagement program. The institutional support for the Atlanta-CTSI is exceptional.

"Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (UL1) In response to the national effort to develop, improve, and deliver clinical and translational science, the leadership of Emory University challenged both faculty and the administration to transform clinical and translational research within the University and its numerous components and affiliates. With ongoing collaborations in heath-care, education, and interdisciplinary research, Emory also chose to engage two of its close academic partners in metropolitan Atlanta - Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) and Georgia Institute of Technology (GA Tech) to form the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (Atlanta-CTSI). This strategic multi-institutional alliance offered compelling and unique advantages. Emory is one of the nation's leading healthcare and academic research institutions, ranking 19th nationally in NIH funded research; GA Tech is a national leader in biomedical engineering and the application of innovative systems engineering to health care solutions; and MSM is a historically black medical school recognized as a national leader in expanding the ethnic diversity of biomedical research, dedicated to community engagement in efforts to eliminate health disparities and serving as a pipeline for training minority investigators. The established partnerships and diverse faculty enable the Atlanta-CTSI to combine strong clinical, translational,training and basic discovery programs at Emory with the health disparities, training and community outreach focus of MSM together with the engineering and bioinformatics achievements of GA Tech. The planning efforts also led to the creation of a new and innovative pediatric clinical and translational research program and a partnership with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, new partnerships with the emerging Georgia biotechnology community and with Kaiser Permanente, and the further development of partnerships with state sponsored agencies (Georgia Research Alliance) and with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Atlanta-CTSI is a model designed to harness the scientific, technological, and clinical advantages of these institutions around the major aims of discovery, training, and community engagement to create a new city wide home for clinical and translational research. Other new programs resulting from the synergistic partnership include an innovative pilot projects program PiCo-TraCS, integrated clinical interactions and biomedical informatics networks (CIN and BIN), creation of a technology ""pipeline"" andAcademy for Translational Methods Development, a bioinformatics Leapfrog initiative, a facilitating Office of Human Studies Research, creative K30/K12 and T32 programs, and an outstanding community engagement program. The institutional support for the Atlanta-CTSI is exceptional. The Atlanta- CTSI utilizes the complementary strengths of Emory, MSM, and GA Tech and other GA institutions to promote the discipline of clinical and translational science and to improve the healthcare of our community.

"The Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (VICTR) KL2 Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) has a long and distinguished history of advancing the science and practice of medicine and preparing scholars for clinical and translational research. The Medical Center's 44 NIH institutional training grants and training grants funded through other federal agencies attest to the breadth, skill, and commitment of our faculty to developing future leaders in clinical investigation. The Vanderbilt General Clinical Research Center (GCRC), one of the oldest and largest in the country, has been an important training ground for many of our nation's leading clinical and translational researchers. In 1999, Vanderbilt obtained K30 funding to create a formal curriculum for the multi-disciplinary research training of clinical investigators at VUMC. That funding resulted in a new degree program¿the Master of Science in Clinical Investigation (MSCI)¿for training clinical researchers in translational research, including mechanisms of human disease, therapeutic interventions, clinical trials, and the development of new technologies. The K30 award also allowed the expansion of the existing Vanderbilt Master of Public Health (MPH) program for clinical investigators directed toward epidemiologic/behavioral research or outcomes/health services research and the translation of medical discoveries into practice. In the same year, Vanderbilt and Meharry Medical College (MMC), a historically black institution, established the Vanderbilt-Meharry Alliance to promote educational collaboration and increased research in Health Disparities. As highlighted throughout this application, the Alliance has allowed for the sharing of resources for training clinical and translational scientists. In 2002, this collaboration resulted in R25 funding of the Clinical Research and Career Development program at Meharry. One year prior to the funding of the K30, Vanderbilt created the Medical Scholars Program (MSP) to allow select medical students to spend one year engaged in focused research. Development of the program in 2004 provided all medical students with a concentrated experience in clinical science or public health promotion. At the same time, Vanderbilt, recognizing the importance of protected time in the development of successful physician-scientists, established the Vanderbilt Physician-Scientist Development Program (VPSD) to provide salary support to newly appointed assistant professor physicians with significant research experience to receive additional mentored investigative training. In 2002, NCRR K12 funding of the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Scholars (VCRS) program provided trainees in clinical and translational science with a similar mentored research apprenticeship integrated with the didactic training of the MSCI and MPH programs.

"Institutional Clinical and Translational Science Award (UW-Madison) A. Summary and Objectives The overall aim of the Research Education and Career Development (REC) Core of the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) is to develop a diverse, multidisciplinary, clinical and translational research workforce capable of accelerating the translation of research findings into evidence-based policies and practices that improve the health of individual patients and all populations in the United States. This goal is consonant with the NIH Roadmap and the recent transformation of the UW School of Medicine into an integrated School of Medicine and Public Health. The REC Core will capitalize on the momentum at UWMadison to: 1) advance multidisciplinary collaborations; 2) implement new curricula that complement existing research education programs; 3) establish and evaluate mentor-training programs; 4) design interventions that build on the career development scholarship of our faculty; and 5) transform institutional culture to increase the participation and advancement of women and underrepresented minority researchers in the academic enterprise. To achieve these goals we will pursue the following Objectives: Objective 1: Create a menu of educational and career development opportunities with multiple portals of entry and varying levels of intensity to accommodate the needs of all learners; build activities around six core competencies in clinical investigation and six core competencies in teamwork. Objective 2: Launch a new cross-college MS/PhD in clinical investigation to complete a menu of graduate degree and certificate programs in clinical or translational research. Objective 3: Move conceptually and programmatically from independent training programs (CTSA K12, CTSA T32, individual K-awards) to ICTR Trainees and Scholars, who are recruited and selected through a uniform process; matched with the appropriate funding sources according to their discipline and stage of career development; and provided appropriate educational opportunities, career support, and well-trained mentors to support their success. Objective 4: Increase the gender and ethnic/racial diversity of future academic leaders by: 1) coordinating minority recruitment across all UW Madison T32s; 2) assisting Pis in obtaining minority supplements to their NIH IRQ 1s; 3) emphasizing opportunities for research on health disparities1; 4) establishing a Minority Scholars Program; 5) including diversity training in professional development; and 6) piloting and evaluating programs to assist young investigators in balancing personal and professional worklife. Pursuing these objectives is essential to strengthen the educational and career development programs that are currently offered at UW and to embrace a more comprehensive approach to training clinical and translational investigators. The programs developed to meet these objectives are founded upon the following principles: ¿ Build on local strengths and multidisciplinary culture ¿ Take an evidence-based approach to education, career development, and institutional transformation by applying research from adult education, social and organizational sciences whenever possible ¿ Incorporate gender and ethnic/racial issues as they apply to all programmatic elements, including recruitment, retention, career development and research on health disparities ¿ View the ICTR as a ""living laboratory"" evaluating interventions and re-directing resources accordingly The objectives for the REC Core are so intertwined that they are approached in a comprehensive manner throughout the section, with many of the initiatives serving as action items for more than one objective.

"The Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (VICTR) KL2 Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) has a long and distinguished history of advancing the science and practice of medicine and preparing scholars for clinical and translational research. The Medical Center's 44 NIH institutional training grants and training grants funded through other federal agencies attest to the breadth, skill, and commitment of our faculty to developing future leaders in clinical investigation. The Vanderbilt General Clinical Research Center (GCRC), one of the oldest and largest in the country, has been an important training ground for many of our nation's leading clinical and translational researchers. In 1999, Vanderbilt obtained K30 funding to create a formal curriculum for the multi-disciplinary research training of clinical investigators at VUMC. That funding resulted in a new degree program¿the Master of Science in Clinical Investigation (MSCI)¿for training clinical researchers in translational research, including mechanisms of human disease, therapeutic interventions, clinical trials, and the development of new technologies. The K30 award also allowed the expansion of the existing Vanderbilt Master of Public Health (MPH) program for clinical investigators directed toward epidemiologic/behavioral research or outcomes/health services research and the translation of medical discoveries into practice. In the same year, Vanderbilt and Meharry Medical College (MMC), a historically black institution, established the Vanderbilt-Meharry Alliance to promote educational collaboration and increased research in Health Disparities. As highlighted throughout this application, the Alliance has allowed for the sharing of resources for training clinical and translational scientists. In 2002, this collaboration resulted in R25 funding of the Clinical Research and Career Development program at Meharry. One year prior to the funding of the K30, Vanderbilt created the Medical Scholars Program (MSP) to allow select medical students to spend one year engaged in focused research. Development of the program in 2004 provided all medical students with a concentrated experience in clinical science or public health promotion. At the same time, Vanderbilt, recognizing the importance of protected time in the development of successful physician-scientists, established the Vanderbilt Physician-Scientist Development Program (VPSD) to provide salary support to newly appointed assistant professor physicians with significant research experience to receive additional mentored investigative training.

"Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an urgent need for reducing or eliminating many health disparities that affect underserved minority populations. Despite important advances in knowledge about the basic mechanisms of disease, translation of this knowledge to treatment and prevention of disease has been limited and slow, in particular for these underserved ethnic and racial minorities. The Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium (PRCTRC) will be established as the concept that will advance this translation of knowledge and have an impact on these disparities. It will be a centralized clinical and translational research program focused on health problems prevalent in an underserved minority population and establishing a multidisciplinary and collaborative effort between three major academic health care institutions in Puerto Rico. The major programmatic goals are to: 1) To enhance and integrate existing infrastructure for clinical and translational research to support and expand Clinical and Translational Research in the Health Disparities; 2) To enhance and support existing training and mentoring programs to increase the number of new minority investigators in Clinical and Translational Research; 3) To facilitate the translation of knowledge from the bench into the community. To accomplish these goals we will integrate, expand and enhance: 1) Participant and Clinical Interaction Resources 2) Clinical and Translational Research core resources in Biostatistics and Data Management 3) Core laboratories and technologies 4) Training and developmental programs 5) Support for regulatory compliance resources 6) Informatic resources 7) Community interactions and participation programs. The proposed program will be integrative, incorporating resources and leadership from all three institutions, many of these under the RCMI-Clinical Research Center (RCMI-CRC) and the Comprehensive Center for Health Disparities (CCHD) but fusing under a single administrative structure. The proposed program will be inclusive, incorporating leadership from all the participating institutions at several levels of administrative responsibility. It will be novel, because it will provide a unique opportunity to incorporate resources and have an impact across a state-size territory composed primarily of a minority population.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): The proposed program will help advance knowledge about conditions that disproportionately affect minority populations and will provide a platform for more efficient collaborations among institutions that serve these populations. By enhancing and consolidating existing resources it will facilitate the discovery of new knowledge in patient-oriented research and will aid in the development of new, clinical and translational minority researchers.           ",Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium,7992048,U54RR026139,[''],NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,U54,2010,4200000,0.2513843098200588
"Translational Research at The University of Chicago (UL1) The ultimate goals of the University of Chicago CTSA program are to train scientists and health care providers at the University, our partner institutions, and our Community to determine the molecular underpinnings of disease or disease predisposition in any individual patient; to develop, test, implement, and make readily available to residents in our Community personalized therapies directed toward those individual underpinnings; and to do this in a way that is rigorous, valid, efficient, ethical, and respectful of our Community's needs and values. In a robust alliance with Argonne National Laboratory, the Illinois Institute of Technology, and two large healthcare organizations, we will undertake three bold new steps that will transform clinical and translational research at our institutions and in our Community: 1) Creation of an Institute for Translational Medicine, a new University-wide structure to collect, integrate, and disseminate the intellectual, organizational, and resource infrastructure needed to promote and support multidisciplinary translational research collaborations; 2) Synergistic research interaction with a new UC Urban Health Initiative which, through partnership with Community stakeholders, aims to improve Community health care access and quality, to build health literacy and trust throughout the Community, to enhance a translational research program informed by and responsive to the needs of the Community, and so to reduce health disparities; and 3) Establishment of a new academic Committee on Clinical and Translational Science and of multiple novel training programs to encourage and develop careers in clinical and translational research, intended for high school students through university faculty and across the entire translational research spectrum. Our consortium of dedicated CTSA investigators will employ a systems medicine approach to leverage their particular expertise in social science, genetic medicine, and integrative therapeutics.

"Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (UL1) In response to the national effort to develop, improve, and deliver clinical and translational science, the leadership of Emory University challenged both faculty and the administration to transform clinical and translational research within the University and its numerous components and affiliates. With ongoing collaborations in heath-care, education, and interdisciplinary research, Emory also chose to engage two of its close academic partners in metropolitan Atlanta - Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) and Georgia Institute of Technology (GA Tech) to form the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (Atlanta-CTSI). This strategic multi-institutional alliance offered compelling and unique advantages. Emory is one of the nation's leading healthcare and academic research institutions, ranking 19th nationally in NIH funded research; GA Tech is a national leader in biomedical engineering and the application of innovative systems engineering to health care solutions; and MSM is a historically black medical school recognized as a national leader in expanding the ethnic diversity of biomedical research, dedicated to community engagement in efforts to eliminate health disparities and serving as a pipeline for training minority investigators. The established partnerships and diverse faculty enable the Atlanta-CTSI to combine strong clinical, translational,training and basic discovery programs at Emory with the health disparities, training and community outreach focus of MSM together with the engineering and bioinformatics achievements of GA Tech. The planning efforts also led to the creation of a new and innovative pediatric clinical and translational research program and a partnership with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, new partnerships with the emerging Georgia biotechnology community and with Kaiser Permanente, and the further development of partnerships with state sponsored agencies (Georgia Research Alliance) and with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Atlanta-CTSI is a model designed to harness the scientific, technological, and clinical advantages of these institutions around the major aims of discovery, training, and community engagement to create a new city wide home for clinical and translational research. Other new programs resulting from the synergistic partnership include an innovative pilot projects program PiCo-TraCS, integrated clinical interactions and biomedical informatics networks (CIN and BIN), creation of a technology ""pipeline"" andAcademy for Translational Methods Development, a bioinformatics Leapfrog initiative, a facilitating Office of Human Studies Research, creative K30/K12 and T32 programs, and an outstanding community engagement program.

"Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium There is an urgent need for reducing or eliminating many health disparities that affect underserved minority populations. Despite important advances in knowledge about the basic mechanisms of disease, translation of this knowledge to treatment and prevention of disease has been limited and slow, in particular for these underserved ethnic and racial minorities. The Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium (PRCTRC) will be established as the concept that will advance this translation of knowledge and have an impact on these disparities. It will be a centralized clinical and translational research program focused on health problems prevalent in an underserved minority population and establishing a multidisciplinary and collaborative effort between three major academic health care institutions in Puerto Rico. The major programmatic goals are to: 1) To enhance and integrate existing infrastructure for clinical and translational research to support and expand Clinical and Translational Research in the Health Disparities; 2) To enhance and support existing training and mentoring programs to increase the number of new minority investigators in Clinical and Translational Research; 3) To facilitate the translation of knowledge from the bench into the community. To accomplish these goals we will integrate, expand and enhance: 1) Participant and Clinical Interaction Resources 2) Clinical and Translational Research core resources in Biostatistics and Data Management 3) Core laboratories and technologies 4) Training and developmental programs 5) Support for regulatory compliance resources 6) Informatic resources 7) Community interactions and participation programs. The proposed program will be integrative, incorporating resources and leadership from all three institutions, many of these under the RCMI-Clinical Research Center (RCMI-CRC) and the Comprehensive Center for Health Disparities (CCHD) but fusing under a single administrative structure. The proposed program will be inclusive, incorporating leadership from all the participating institutions at several levels of administrative responsibility. It will be novel, because it will provide a unique opportunity to incorporate resources and have an impact across a state-size territory composed primarily of a minority population. The proposed program will help advance knowledge about conditions that disproportionately affect minority populations and will provide a platform for more efficient collaborations among institutions that serve these populations.

"The Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (VICTR) KL2 Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) has a long and distinguished history of advancing the science and practice of medicine and preparing scholars for clinical and translational research. The Medical Center's 44 NIH institutional training grants and training grants funded through other federal agencies attest to the breadth, skill, and commitment of our faculty to developing future leaders in clinical investigation. The Vanderbilt General Clinical Research Center (GCRC), one of the oldest and largest in the country, has been an important training ground for many of our nation's leading clinical and translational researchers. In 1999, Vanderbilt obtained K30 funding to create a formal curriculum for the multi-disciplinary research training of clinical investigators at VUMC. That funding resulted in a new degree program¿the Master of Science in Clinical Investigation (MSCI)¿for training clinical researchers in translational research, including mechanisms of human disease, therapeutic interventions, clinical trials, and the development of new technologies. The K30 award also allowed the expansion of the existing Vanderbilt Master of Public Health (MPH) program for clinical investigators directed toward epidemiologic/behavioral research or outcomes/health services research and the translation of medical discoveries into practice. In the same year, Vanderbilt and Meharry Medical College (MMC), a historically black institution, established the Vanderbilt-Meharry Alliance to promote educational collaboration and increased research in Health Disparities. As highlighted throughout this application, the Alliance has allowed for the sharing of resources for training clinical and translational scientists. In 2002, this collaboration resulted in R25 funding of the Clinical Research and Career Development program at Meharry. One year prior to the funding of the K30, Vanderbilt created the Medical Scholars Program (MSP) to allow select medical students to spend one year engaged in focused research. Development of the program in 2004 provided all medical students with a concentrated experience in clinical science or public health promotion. At the same time, Vanderbilt, recognizing the importance of protected time in the development of successful physician-scientists, established the Vanderbilt Physician-Scientist Development Program (VPSD) to provide salary support to newly appointed assistant professor physicians with significant research experience to receive additional mentored investigative training. In 2002, NCRR K12 funding of the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Scholars (VCRS) program provided trainees in clinical and translational science with a similar mentored research apprenticeship integrated with the didactic training of the MSCI and MPH programs.

"Institutional Clinical and Translational Science Award (UW-Madison) A. Summary and Objectives The overall aim of the Research Education and Career Development (REC) Core of the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) is to develop a diverse, multidisciplinary, clinical and translational research workforce capable of accelerating the translation of research findings into evidence-based policies and practices that improve the health of individual patients and all populations in the United States. This goal is consonant with the NIH Roadmap and the recent transformation of the UW School of Medicine into an integrated School of Medicine and Public Health. The REC Core will capitalize on the momentum at UWMadison to: 1) advance multidisciplinary collaborations; 2) implement new curricula that complement existing research education programs; 3) establish and evaluate mentor-training programs; 4) design interventions that build on the career development scholarship of our faculty; and 5) transform institutional culture to increase the participation and advancement of women and underrepresented minority researchers in the academic enterprise. To achieve these goals we will pursue the following Objectives: Objective 1: Create a menu of educational and career development opportunities with multiple portals of entry and varying levels of intensity to accommodate the needs of all learners; build activities around six core competencies in clinical investigation and six core competencies in teamwork. Objective 2: Launch a new cross-college MS/PhD in clinical investigation to complete a menu of graduate degree and certificate programs in clinical or translational research. Objective 3: Move conceptually and programmatically from independent training programs (CTSA K12, CTSA T32, individual K-awards) to ICTR Trainees and Scholars, who are recruited and selected through a uniform process; matched with the appropriate funding sources according to their discipline and stage of career development; and provided appropriate educational opportunities, career support, and well-trained mentors to support their success. Objective 4: Increase the gender and ethnic/racial diversity of future academic leaders by: 1) coordinating minority recruitment across all UW Madison T32s; 2) assisting Pis in obtaining minority supplements to their NIH IRQ 1s; 3) emphasizing opportunities for research on health disparities1; 4) establishing a Minority Scholars Program; 5) including diversity training in professional development; and 6) piloting and evaluating programs to assist young investigators in balancing personal and professional worklife. Pursuing these objectives is essential to strengthen the educational and career development programs that are currently offered at UW and to embrace a more comprehensive approach to training clinical and translational investigators. The programs developed to meet these objectives are founded upon the following principles: ¿ Build on local strengths and multidisciplinary culture ¿ Take an evidence-based approach to education, career development, and institutional transformation by applying research from adult education, social and organizational sciences whenever possible ¿ Incorporate gender and ethnic/racial issues as they apply to all programmatic elements, including recruitment, retention, career development and research on health disparities ¿ View the ICTR as a ""living laboratory"" evaluating interventions and re-directing resources accordingly The objectives for the REC Core are so intertwined that they are approached in a comprehensive manner throughout the section, with many of the initiatives serving as action items for more than one objective.

"Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (UL1) In response to the national effort to develop, improve, and deliver clinical and translational science, the leadership of Emory University challenged both faculty and the administration to transform clinical and translational research within the University and its numerous components and affiliates. With ongoing collaborations in heath-care, education, and interdisciplinary research, Emory also chose to engage two of its close academic partners in metropolitan Atlanta - Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) and Georgia Institute of Technology (GA Tech) to form the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (Atlanta-CTSI). This strategic multi-institutional alliance offered compelling and unique advantages. Emory is one of the nation's leading healthcare and academic research institutions, ranking 19th nationally in NIH funded research; GA Tech is a national leader in biomedical engineering and the application of innovative systems engineering to health care solutions; and MSM is a historically black medical school recognized as a national leader in expanding the ethnic diversity of biomedical research, dedicated to community engagement in efforts to eliminate health disparities and serving as a pipeline for training minority investigators. The established partnerships and diverse faculty enable the Atlanta-CTSI to combine strong clinical, translational, training and basic discovery programs at Emory with the health disparities, training and community outreach focus of MSM together with the engineering and bioinformatics achievements of GA Tech. The planning efforts also led to the creation of a new and innovative pediatric clinical and translational research program and a partnership with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, new partnerships with the emerging Georgia biotechnology community and with Kaiser Permanente, and the further development of partnerships with state sponsored agencies (Georgia Research Alliance) and with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Atlanta-CTSI is a model designed to harness the scientific, technological, and clinical advantages of these institutions around the major aims of discovery, training, and community engagement to create a new city wide home for clinical and translational research. Other new programs resulting from the synergistic partnership include an innovative pilot projects program PiCo-TraCS, integrated clinical interactions and biomedical informatics networks (CIN and BIN), creation of a technology ""pipeline"" and Academy for Translational Methods Development, a bioinformatics Leapfrog initiative, a facilitating Office of Human Studies Research, creative K30/K12 and T32 programs, and an outstanding community engagement program.

"Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (MICHR) (KL2) A. Overview. At Michigan, we enjoy a campus rich in clinical research training programs. We have NCRR K30 and K12 programs under the same leadership. There are two other NIH K12 programs and we are the only institution to house all three RWJ clinical research training programs. Several years ago, the institutionally-funded Center for Advancement of Clinical Research (now MICHR) began to help coordinate some of these programs and also began a series of education programs aimed at both faculty and staff that filled gaps not addressed by these NIH-funded and other training programs. More recently, MICHR also recently worked with Dr. Sewon Kang to successfully compete for a Roadmap T32, aimed at giving medical, dental, nursing, and pharmacy students additional training in clinical research. Last year this new program began a second new Master's in Clinical Research to augment and complement the longstanding and successful On Job, On Campus Master's in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis in the School of Public Health. MICHR leadership has continued to work closely with the leaders of all of the above programs, serving as members on the executive and advisory committees of these units and co-sponsoring a number of education courses and symposia. Despite many successful programs and a high existing degree of integration during our planning for the UM CTSA, we identified many present barriers or unrecognized opportunities that we felt could be addressed by a new MICHR Education Program. To train individuals who will comprise the translational research teams of the future, we feel we must not only build upon these successful programs, but entirely re-engineer the educational paradigms we use to train clinical and translational researchers. We propose an innovative program to overcome the following barriers: ¿ Although all of these clinical and translational research training programs at UM are successful and fill critical needs, they focus on providing time-intensive training requiring one year or more of dedicated study and are designed primarily for physicians and other healthcare providers. o The research teams of the future will contain many healthcare providers and others who do not desire or need as intensive training; we have few programs at UM aimed at these key research team members, o Similarly, the research teams of the future need intensively trained study coordinators, data managers, etc., who are not currently being trained at UM or most universities, o Other important constituencies in the translational research teams of the future whose needs are not being adequately met with our current programs include basic scientists, patients and community members, undergraduates, and mid-career faculty. ¿ We have 68 T32 training grants at UM, most of which require some modest element of clinical research . training. Often, in each department or unit, a few fellows or residents at at time get an isolated and often inadequate exposure to clinical and translational research methods and training. Not only is this harmful to the overall training of these individuals but, more importantly, it represents a missed opportunity to excite these trainees about a career in clinical and translational research. There is a need for centralized clinical and translational research education programs to meet this need and to enhance the MICHR mission of creating a community of clinical and translational researchers. ¿ Even though we have excellent mentorship programs embedded within the K30 and K12 programs, Michigan trainees and junior faculty who are not in these programs often have difficulty identifying and engaging a mentor or mentors. ¿ Success in recruiting qualified minority postdoctoral trainees is limited due to a small pool of candidates in the biomedical sciences. , ¿ Our current training programs are primarily 'face-to-face' and do not maximally leverage modern technologies to increase access to trainees and faculty, neither at UM nor at a distance. ¿ New developments in the training of clinical translational researchers often remain within the institution and do not transcend into the national scene. The Education and Mentoring Program of MICHR (hereafter referred to as the Education Program or EP) will design new educational programs and transform existing programs to meet the diverse needs of the broader clinical and translational research community. By utilizing innovative methods in interdisciplinary education and effective mentoring to facilitate the career development, we propose to establish a coordinated curriculum in translational research. The MICHR EP curriculum will: 1) increase the number of professionals receiving combined training in basic and clinical research through expansion of our current master's degrees, certificates, and courses; 2) create a new PhD program in Clinical and Translational Research; 3) create a novel Postdoctoral Translational Scholars Program; 4) consolidate and integrate teaching strategies now used in separate settings; 5) develop translational research tracks in key areas of biomedical and health research, drawing on UM's areas of strength and spanning the bench-bedside-practice translation loop; 6) enhance access to trained mentors; 7) develop novel alternative learning methodology to increase flexibility and expand the reach of training to a wider segment of the academic, professional, and lay communities; 8) expand the training opportunities to the lay and professional communities in order to facilitate translation from bedside-topractice; 9) expand the pool of under-represented minority scholars by increasing and coordinating recruitment efforts and extending translational research education to undergraduate, predoctoral, and graduate minority students; and 10) continuously evaluate the objectives of translational research training program to determine if objectives are successfully met. This Program will be developed according to MICHR guiding objectives. Because the program is focused on education, the majority of aims align with MICHR Guiding Objective 2 (education and training), but other MICHR guiding objectives are also relevant.

"HMORN UCSF Center for Diabetes Translational Research Diabetes mellitus is a significant health and cost burden in the United States. The evidence base for the prevention and care of T2DM is one of the most well-established of any chronic illness; however, the overall quality of care for diabetes remains sub-optimal, and to date relatively little attention has been paid to programs for preventing diabetes. Programs which can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-based diabetes prevention and treatment into widespread practice are desperately needed. In response to this need, diabetes researchers at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, HealthPartners Research Foundation, Harvard Pilgrim, and the University of California San Francisco, propose to create a Center for Diabetes Translational Research (CDTR) that will actively foster and support translational research in diabetes within health care delivery systems affiliated with the HMO Research Network (HMORN) and the State of California. The proposed HMORN-UCSF CDTR will achieve its aims by developing a multi-disciplinary network of well-established investigators with a strong history of receiving both federal and foundation funding in diabetes translational research. This CDTR will be structured around three Translational Research Cores in the areas of health care disparities, diabetes and obesity prevention, and the use of health information technology to improve diabetes care. The proposed CDTR investigators have significant experience in translational research in T2DM care and prevention in both adults and children, as well as in pregnant women with gestational diabetes (GDM). These investigators have strong relationships with care delivery systems, ranging from large integrated delivery systems to networks of safety net providers, that can serve as important partners for translating effective interventions into real-world clinical settings.

"Drew RCMI Translational Research Network On behalf of the 18 Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI), Charles R. Drew University submits this application to design and implement the RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN or Network). The successful translation of research findings to address health disparities is limited by growing barriers between clinical and basic researchers. RTRN will foster collaborative translational research with a particular focus on key health disparity disease areas; establish a Data Technology Coordinating Center (DTCC) at Jackson State University (JSU) and provide innovative opportunities to share educational, research, and community resources. The Network seeks to transform institutional research culture across the Network members by promoting institutional incentives (e.g., promotion, tenure) for research efforts that produce tangible advances in health outcomes. To leverage the unique strengths of the RCMI community (7450 NIH funded projects) and achieve previously unrealized research synergies, RTRN will facilitate interactions between clinical and basic scientists working within different disease areas, create bridges between academia and community to accelerate the clinical efficacy of research advances, and foster the development of future leaders in translational medicine with a sensitivity to health areas disproportionately affecting disadvantaged populations. RTRN will initiate a multidisciplinary ""proof-of-concept"" project addressing cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the nation. The Network specific aims include:   Specific Aim 1: Establish the Network.

"RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals who suffer from disproportionately high rates of premature morbidity and mortality, including racial and ethnic minorities, those of low socioeconomic status, and rural persons, are considered health disparity populations. ""Translational Research"", a bidirectional process focused on ""translating"" basic scientific discoveries into health interventions, and then into clinical practice to improve patient care and population health, has been proposed as an important approach to reduce health disparities. Connecting these populations to new health advances requires effective health education, engaging more minority participants in clinical trials, producing more minority investigators and enhancing research infrastructure at minority institutions. RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) have been developed to leverage the existing physical and intellectual resources and to promote and support relevant multi-site clinical and translational research focused on reducing health disparities and improving health outcomes. To build upon five years of infrastructure growth, the consortium of NIH-funded Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) has come together to submit for a renewal for the network. RTRN will continue to synergize and coordinate the considerable multidisciplinary talents of basic, clinical and community investigators to gain new knowledge about the social, economic, behavioral, cultural, environmental, perinatal and genetic determinants of health disparities. Based on the success of the first five years and the data arising from the RTRN evaluation, as well as critical input from the RCMI Steering and External Advisory Committees, the following specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: Enhance and streamline overall RTRN management and operations; Specific Aim 2: Engage RCMI investigators and other stakeholders, including the lay community, to strengthen capacity for multi-site clinical and translational research; Specific Aim 3: Enhance the infrastructure for project management, performance monitoring and data analysis; and Specific Aim 4.- Enhance the development and adoption of best practices for disseminating research findings to reduce health disparities and improve disease outcomes. By leveraging the research infrastructure and resources across RCMI grantee institutions, these four specific  aims will contribute to the overall goal of RTRN, which is to accelerate the quality and pace of transformative  research on diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnically diverse, low income, geographically  remote, and/or medically underserved populations.",RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN),8528896,U54MD008149,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Talents ', ' Translating ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved population ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Minority ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' population health ', ' operation ', ' ']",NIMHD,CHARLES R.

"Re-Engineering Translational Research at the University of Chicago The University of Chicago (UC) Institute for Translational Medicine (ITM) was created in 2007 to assemble, integrate, and create the intellectual, administrative, and physical resources required to catalyze research and research training in Clinical and Translational Science. Its ultimate goals are to train scientists and health care providers at UC and in our community to determine the molecular, genetic, pathophysiologic and social determinants of disease and disease predisposition in individuals; to test interventions directed toward those mechanisms; and to achieve these goals in a way that is rigorous, efficient, ethical, respectful of, and responsive to our community's needs and values. In its first 4 years, the ITM has capitalized on the outstanding intellectual and physical resources throughout the University and ait ITM affiliate Institutions, Argonne National Laboratory, North Shore University Health System, Illinois Institute of Technology, and Access Community Health Network, and on substantial institutional and CTSA financial investments, to build the infrastructure for a transformative, energized, and self-improving home for clinical and translational research. The impact of the ITM has been greatest in 5 domains: 1) catalyzing the formation of multidisciplinary research teams; 2) establishing a systematic, organized clinical and translational research infrastructure; 3) engaging our community in research; 4) training for careers in clinical and translational team science; and 5) impact on and contributions to the National CTSA Consortium.

"Kentucky Center for Clinical and Translational Science At the University of Kentucky (UK), we have established the Center for Clinical and Translational Science  (CCTS) as a home for clinical and translational research. UK is located in Lexington, on the western edge of  mid-Appalachia, one ofthe poorest areas ofthe country, where there are unprecedented disparities in  disease and mortality. Many of these disparities stem from risky behaviors, such as smoking, drug abuse,  and obesity. In this proposal, our overarching goal is to transform the pace, effectiveness, and quality of  translational research at UK which will result in better health for the people of mid-Appalachia. Scientific  discovery offers the potential for improved care, with community-based research offering a faster impact on  health through a better dissemination of optimal medical care. However, scientific discoveries often do not  reach the community due to the many difficulties with navigating the complex process of clinical and  translational research.

"Institutional Clinical and Translational Science Award The University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) and its partner, Marshfield Clinic, remain committed to the challenge of transforming the research culture and environment to further develop clinical and translational science as a distinct discipline. UW approaches this challenge with the unique perspective afforded by the ongoing transformation of the Medical School to a School of Medicine and Public Health, which has mandated creation of a health delivery system based on effective application of current knowledge by turning it into current practice. Achieving this goal is facilitated by the strength UW derives from a strong and committed partnership forged by its Health Sciences Schools/College and Marshfield Clinic. Over the past four years, the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR), formed as the vehicle to achieve the cultural transformation, has coupled a catalytic investment of new resources with the integration, synergy, and amplification of existing resources to forge substantive changes in the research environment and culture for clinical and translational research. Our key goal will continue: to create an environment that facilitates transformation of research at the UW and Marshfield Clinic into a continuum extending from investigation to discovery to translation into practice. To achieve this goal, ICTR will further stimulate the creation of interdisciplinary teams, make available state-of-the-art core facilities, expand biostatistical and biomedical informatics resources, forge new partnerships with community organizations, and encourage research participation in the continuum of translational sciences. ICTR will continue to develop a cadre of multidisciplinary biomedical and behavioral scientists capable of accelerating translation of research findings into evidence-based policies and practices, which will improve health in the U.S'. Such outcomes will be facilitated by the formation of interdisciplinary research teams, which bridge the gulf between the basic scientists at the University and community partners, selected from an extensive well-developed clinical network in Wisconsin. These initiatives will further stimulate evolution of the research culture to fulfill the ""Wisconsin Idea,"" a concept linking University efforts to the well-being of the residents in Wisconsin. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The University of Wisconsin-Madison and Marshfield Clinic are committed to support multidisciplinary biomedical and behavioral research that spans basic science to clinical research, often done collaboratively with community partners and to assure that the results of these studies are disseminated to communities to positively impact on health care in the community and the health of community members.",Institutional Clinical and Translational Science Award,8467409,KL2TR000428,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Animals ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Scholarship ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Writing ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Metric ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Core Facility ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Instruction ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' forging ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' health equity ', ' ']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,KL2,2012,1899021,0.1738378368833836

"Mentored postdoctoral training in health disparities and community-partnered part     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed CRECD Program at Charles R. Drew University (CDU), Mentored Postdoctoral Training in Translational Research, is a Phase II mentored clinical research and career development program designed to develop a diverse cadre of clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases, in particular those diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States (e.g., HIV/AIDS, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mental health/psychiatric disorders), and to foster and facilitate professional development activities in clinical and translational sciences. Over the initial 5-year program period, the CRECD Program will accept a total of eight postdoctoral trainees at the junior faculty level at CDU, each for 3-year appointments, staggered in appointment periods. The CRECD Program will be embedded within the existing, extensive clinical research and training infrastructure at CDU, and thus will mutually leverage resources with other CDU research education and career development programs so as to achieve maximal cross-program synergies as well as efficiencies wrought from utilizing already-in-place education and training curricula and related resources germane to the CRECD agenda. However, the CRECD Program will also carve out a unique niche of training and career development opportunities within the broader CDU science-generating ""critical mass"" by (1) focusing exclusively on health disparities and mastery of community-partnered participatory methods in the research and research training agenda and (2) providing to each trainee a first-of-its-kind (at CDU and, by our estimate, nationwide) intensive and community-immersive mentoring configuration that includes CDU faculty from both the standard or conventional Academic Career track and the newly emerging Community Faculty track, called the Partnership for Equity and Equality in Health and Wellness. This intensive mentoring innovation directly emerges from, and formalizes and systematizes into a signature trainee mentoring configuration, a long and fruitful history of community-engaged research, training, and educational curricula at CDU. As an integrated research training and career development package, this approach is designed to bring social determinants of health to the forefront of molecular and clinical research. Ultimately, the goal is to increase the impact of community- academic partnered research and adoption of its evidence-based best practices through comprehensive dissemination of research findings so as to encourage and facilitate implementation of evidence-based treatment and prevention practices within health care organizations and the communities most in need of reliable access to high-quality care.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): By providing an outstanding and intensive research mentoring, training, and career development opportunity to minority and other underrepresented postdoctoral scholars in the translational sciences, this new program at Charles Drew University will increase the diversity of the scientific workforce and develop next-generation clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases, in particular those diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States.              (provided by applicant): By providing an outstanding and intensive research mentoring, training, and career development opportunity to minority and other underrepresented postdoctoral scholars in the translational sciences, this new program at Charles Drew University will increase the diversity of the scientific workforce and develop next-generation clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases, in particular those diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States.            ",Mentored postdoctoral training in health disparities and community-partnered part,8370196,R25MD007610,"['cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Adoption ', ' Appointment ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Health ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Counseling ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mentors ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Methods ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Industry ', ' Scholarship ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Public Sector ', ' Private Sector ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' career ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Universities ', ' Science ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' United States ', ' Training and Education ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' programs ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Scientist ', ' Ensure ', ' Fostering ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' career development ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Prevention ', ' skills ', ' health care organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' member ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' dissemination research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Health Sciences ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' evidence base ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' social health determinants ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' ']",NIMHD,CHARLES R.

"HMORN UCSF Center for Diabetes Translational Research Diabetes mellitus is a significant health and cost burden in the United States. The evidence base for the prevention and care of T2DM is one of the most well-established of any chronic illness; however, the overall quality of care for diabetes remains sub-optimal, and to date relatively little attention has been paid to programs for preventing diabetes. Programs which can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-based diabetes prevention and treatment into widespread practice are desperately needed. In response to this need, diabetes researchers at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, HealthPartners Research Foundation, Harvard Pilgrim, and the University of California San Francisco, propose to create a Center for Diabetes Translational Research (CDTR) that will actively foster and support translational research in diabetes within health care delivery systems affiliated with the HMO Research Network (HMORN) and the State of California. The proposed HMORN-UCSF CDTR will achieve its aims by developing a multi-disciplinary network of well-established investigators with a strong history of receiving both federal and foundation funding in diabetes translational research. This CDTR will be structured around three Translational Research Cores in the areas of health care disparities, diabetes and obesity prevention, and the use of health information technology to improve diabetes care. The proposed CDTR investigators have significant experience in translational research in T2DM care and prevention in both adults and children, as well as in pregnant women with gestational diabetes (GDM). These investigators have strong relationships with care delivery systems, ranging from large integrated delivery systems to networks of safety net providers, that can serve as important partners for translating effective interventions into real-world clinical settings.  The Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, HealthPartners Research Foundation, Harvard Pilgrim, and the University of California San Francisco propose to create a Center for Diabetes Translational Research that will actively support and foster translational research in Type 2 diabetes prevention and care.",HMORN UCSF Center for Diabetes Translational Research,8336868,P30DK092924,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' California ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Insurance ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' pregnancy diabetes ', ' Pregnancy-Induced Diabetes ', ' Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Gestational Diabetes ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Integrated Delivery Systems ', ' Staging ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Data ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' obesity prevention ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' diabetes control ', ' health information technology ', ' ']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,P30,2012,421101,0.11011296023652409

Despite important advances in knowledge about the basic mechanisms of disease, translation of this knowledge to treatment and prevention of disease has been limited and slow, in particular for these underserved ethnic and racial minorities. The Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium (PRCTRC) will be established as the concept that will advance this translation of knowledge and have an impact on these disparities. It will be a centralized clinical and translational research program focused on health problems prevalent in an underserved minority population and establishing a multidisciplinary and collaborative effort between three major academic health care institutions in Puerto Rico. The major programmatic goals are to: 1) To enhance and integrate existing infrastructure for clinical and translational research to support and expand Clinical and Translational Research in the Health Disparities; 2) To enhance  and support existing training and mentoring programs to increase the number of new minority investigators in Clinical and Translational Research; 3)To facilitate the translation of knowledge from the bench into the community. To accomplish these goals we will integrate, expand and enhance: 1) Participant and Clinical Interaction Resources 2) Clinical and Translational Research core resources in Biostatistics and Data Management 3) Core laboratories and technologies 4) Training and developmental programs 5) Support for regulatory compliance resources 6) Informatic resources 7) Community interactions and participation programs. The proposed program will be integrative, incorporating resources and leadership from all three institutions, many of these under the RCMI-Clinical Research Center (RCMI-CRC) and the Comprehensive Center for Health Disparities (CCHD) but fusing under a single administrative structure. The proposed program will be inclusive, incorporating leadership from all the participating institutions at several levels of administrative responsibility. It will be novel, because it will provide a unique opportunity to incorporate resources and have an impact across a state-size territory composed primarily of a minority population. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The proposed program will help advance knowledge about conditions that disproportionately affect minority  populations and will provide a platform for more efficient collaborations among institutions that serve these  populations. By enhancing and consolidating existing resources it will facilitate the discovery of new  knowledge in patient-oriented research and will aid in the development of new, clinical and translational  minority researchers.",Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium,8546033,U54MD007587,"['Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Affect ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Goals ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Leadership ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Technology ', ' Research ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Universities ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Training Programs ', ' Science ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Medical ', ' Fostering ', ' Training ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Structure ', ' data management ', ' Population ', ' Instruction ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Resource Informatics ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' knowledge translation ', ' Minority ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,U54,2012,291195,0.25084650511628326

"Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science: A Partnership to Improve Health San Antonio, the gateway to South Texas, is the 7*^ largest city in the US and the largest metropolitan area with a majority Hispanic population (63%). South Texas is about the size of Ohio, and comprises an impoverished and largely Hispanic population with disproportionate rates of diabetes and obesity, exacerbated by a lack of health insurance and poor access to health care. This region also contains numerous US military installations, and active-duty service members and veterans often have special health issues, including Increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic injuries. Unfortunately, neither better access to care nor improved care delivery can eliminate health disparities and meet these complex needs, in addition, research across the full T l to T4 translational spectrum is required to eliminate knowledge gaps and establish real-world effectiveness that improves health care for our populations.  In 2006, UTHSCSA established the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science (IIMS) to improve health and reduce disparities by accelerating scientific discoveries and applications across the full translational research spectrum. For example, IIMS expanded the number of clinical research units that extend to the Texas-Mexico border from 1 to 7, and dramatically increasing participant access to clinical and translational science. We increased, from 2 to 6, the Practice-Based Research Networks that focus on diverse ambulatory populations. Efforts to address translational science workforce needs over the past 5-10 years have graduated 100 Masters Clinical Investigation students, supported 19 successful KL2 Scholars, and established new joint Translational Science PhD and Certificate programs. In this proposal, we provide strategies to spur clinical and translational science evolution, catalyze research teams, and implement programs that produce creative, collaborative, and culturally diverse scientists. Our Specific Aims will: 1. Accelerate clinical and translational research innovation and effective team science along the  entire 11 to T4 research spectrum by providing an academic home integrated with our strategic  partner institutions. 2. Expand, diversify, and enhance the workforce of interdisciplinary translational biomedical scientists. 3. Implement effective methods to continuously evaluate and optimize services, increase  efficiencies, improve processes, and reduce costs across all IIMS programs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Based on our vision of improving the health status of South Texas by accelerating scientific discoveries and public health applications, we will deploy strategic resources that focus on prevalent challenges in our region, including: 1) the health needs of our underserved Hispanic population, 2) the special health issues facing active-duty military and veteran populations, and 3) limitations in the translational science workforce required to fill in critical knowledge gaps and improve health in South Texas and the US.

"Mentored postdoctoral training in health disparities and community-partnered part     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed CRECD Program at Charles R. Drew University (CDU), Mentored Postdoctoral Training in Translational Research, is a Phase II mentored clinical research and career development program designed to develop a diverse cadre of clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases, in particular those diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States (e.g., HIV/AIDS, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mental health/psychiatric disorders), and to foster and facilitate professional development activities in clinical and translational sciences. Over the initial 5-year program period, the CRECD Program will accept a total of eight postdoctoral trainees at the junior faculty level at CDU, each for 3-year appointments, staggered in appointment periods. The CRECD Program will be embedded within the existing, extensive clinical research and training infrastructure at CDU, and thus will mutually leverage resources with other CDU research education and career development programs so as to achieve maximal cross-program synergies as well as efficiencies wrought from utilizing already-in-place education and training curricula and related resources germane to the CRECD agenda. However, the CRECD Program will also carve out a unique niche of training and career development opportunities within the broader CDU science-generating ""critical mass"" by (1) focusing exclusively on health disparities and mastery of community-partnered participatory methods in the research and research training agenda and (2) providing to each trainee a first-of-its-kind (at CDU and, by our estimate, nationwide) intensive and community-immersive mentoring configuration that includes CDU faculty from both the standard or conventional Academic Career track and the newly emerging Community Faculty track, called the Partnership for Equity and Equality in Health and Wellness. This intensive mentoring innovation directly emerges from, and formalizes and systematizes into a signature trainee mentoring configuration, a long and fruitful history of community-engaged research, training, and educational curricula at CDU. As an integrated research training and career development package, this approach is designed to bring social determinants of health to the forefront of molecular and clinical research. Ultimately, the goal is to increase the impact of community- academic partnered research and adoption of its evidence-based best practices through comprehensive dissemination of research findings so as to encourage and facilitate implementation of evidence-based treatment and prevention practices within health care organizations and the communities most in need of reliable access to high-quality care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): By providing an outstanding and intensive research mentoring, training, and career development opportunity to minority and other underrepresented postdoctoral scholars in the translational sciences, this new program at Charles Drew University will increase the diversity of the scientific workforce and develop next-generation clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases, in particular those diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States.            ",Mentored postdoctoral training in health disparities and community-partnered part,8547819,R25MD007610,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Adoption ', ' Appointment ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Industry ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Private Sector ', ' Public Sector ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Scholarship ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' Science ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Training and Education ', ' health care organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' career development ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' dissemination research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' social health determinants ', ' ']",NIMHD,CHARLES R.

"Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network IDeA-CTR     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is compelling need for a Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network (CTR-IN) to serve the seven Western Region IDeA states (AK HI, ID, MT, NM NV and WY) our states cover 1/3 of the US and mass yet currently contribute little to clinical and translational science. The CTR-IN will provide infrastructure and centralized services in support of institutions that for the most part have successful programs in basic science, but little or no tradition or capacity in clinical or translational research. Eleven of the 13 partners in this proposal have minimal resources to support faculty in this work. The other two With CTSA and RCMI support are relatively small but eager to help the others. Our mission is to increase the quantity, quality, and competitive, peer-reviewed support for clinical and translational research across these 7 states thereby accelerating the translation and application of scientific discovery improve health in our region and elsewhere. Academic institutions in this region share common challenges in building these research capabilities in under-resourced environments that are geographically large and rural. With ethnically diverse populations many of which are impoverished with poor access to care, including vulnerable subgroups with significant health disparities. We will provide education mentoring, study design. bio statistical and study design support. and a variety of opportunities (pilot grants, mini-sabbaticals and visiting scholarships} for exposure to levels of science and clinical research environments that are simply not available to faculty at their home institutions An essential element of our proposal is a robust internet presence that will provide the asynchronous access to Information and services essential in our area which spans 4 time zones. Our network will also support high bandwidth synchronous communication for video conferencing, seminars and similar unifying events that will efficiently bring state-of-the-art science and resources w isolated partners. To accomplish our mission, we will partner with the University of New Mexico CTSC and the RCMI program at the University of Hawaii to extend their expertise and leverage their resources across the region.

"HMORN UCSF Center for Diabetes Translational Research Diabetes mellitus is a significant health and cost burden in the United States. The evidence base for the prevention and care of T2DM is one of the most well-established of any chronic illness; however, the overall quality of care for diabetes remains sub-optimal, and to date relatively little attention has been paid to programs for preventing diabetes. Programs which can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-based diabetes prevention and treatment into widespread practice are desperately needed. In response to this need, diabetes researchers at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, HealthPartners Research Foundation, Harvard Pilgrim, and the University of California San Francisco, propose to create a Center for Diabetes Translational Research (CDTR) that will actively foster and support translational research in diabetes within health care delivery systems affiliated with the HMO Research Network (HMORN) and the State of California. The proposed HMORN-UCSF CDTR will achieve its aims by developing a multi-disciplinary network of well-established investigators with a strong history of receiving both federal and foundation funding in diabetes translational research. This CDTR will be structured around three Translational Research Cores in the areas of health care disparities, diabetes and obesity prevention, and the use of health information technology to improve diabetes care. The proposed CDTR investigators have significant experience in translational research in T2DM care and prevention in both adults and children, as well as in pregnant women with gestational diabetes (GDM). These investigators have strong relationships with care delivery systems, ranging from large integrated delivery systems to networks of safety net providers, that can serve as important partners for translating effective interventions into real-world clinical settings.  The Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, HealthPartners Research Foundation, Harvard Pilgrim, and the University of California San Francisco propose to create a Center for Diabetes Translational Research that will actively support and foster translational research in Type 2 diabetes prevention and care.",HMORN UCSF Center for Diabetes Translational Research,8546349,P30DK092924,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' California ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Insurance ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' pregnancy diabetes ', ' Pregnancy-Induced Diabetes ', ' Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Gestational Diabetes ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Integrated Delivery Systems ', ' Staging ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Data ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' obesity prevention ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' diabetes control ', ' health information technology ', ' ']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,P30,2013,397098,0.11011296023652409
"Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science: A Partnership to Improve Health San Antonio, the gateway to South Texas, is the 7""^ largest city in the US and the largest metropolitan area with a majority Hispanic population (63%). South Texas is about the size of Ohio, and comprises an impoverished and largely Hispanic population with disproportionate rates of diabetes and obesity, exacerbated by a lack of health insurance and poor access to health care. This region also contains numerous US military installations, and active-duty service members and veterans often have special health issues, including increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic injuries. Unfortunately, neither better access to care nor improved care delivery can eliminate health disparities and meet these complex needs. In addition, research across the full T l to T4 translational spectrum is required to eliminate knowledge gaps and establish real-world effectiveness that improves health cai^e for our populations.  In 2006, UTHSCSA established the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science (IIMS) to improve health and reduce disparities by accelerating scientific discoveries and applications across the full translational research spectrum. For example, IIMS expanded the number of clinical research units that extend to the Texas-Mexico border from 1 to 7, and dramatically increasing participant access to clinical and translational science. We increased, from 2 to 6, the Practice-Based Research Networks that focus on diverse ambulatory populations. Efforts to address translational science workforce needs over the past 5-10 years have graduated 100 Masters Clinical Investigation students, supported 19 successful KL2 Scholars, and established new joint Translational Science PhD and Certificate programs. In this proposal, we provide strategies to spur clinical and translational science evolution, catalyze research teams, and implement programs that produce creative, collaborative, and culturally diverse scientists. Our Specific Aims will: 1. Accelerate clinical and translational research innovation and effective team science along the  entire T1 to 14 research spectrum by providing an academic home integrated with our strategic  partner institutions. 2. Expand, diversify, and enhance the workforce of interdisciplinary translational biomedical scientists. 3. Implement effective methods to continuously evaluate and optimize services, increase  efficiencies, improve processes, and reduce costs across all IIMS programs. RELEVANCE (See instructions); Based on our vision of improving the health status of South Texas by accelerating scientific discoveries and public health applications, we will deploy strategic resources that focus on prevalent challenges in our region, including: 1) the health needs of our underserved Hispanic population, 2) the special health issues facing active-duty military and veteran populations, and 3) limitations in the translational science workforce required to fill in critical knowledge gaps and improve health in South Texas and the US.

"Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium There is an urgent need for reducing or eliminating many health disparities that affect underserved minority  populations. Despite important advances in knowledge about the basic mechanisms of disease, translation of this knowledge to treatment and prevention of disease has been limited and slow, in particular for these underserved ethnic and racial minorities. The Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium (PRCTRC) will be established as the concept that will advance this translation of knowledge and have an impact on these disparities. It will be a centralized clinical and translational research program focused on health problems prevalent in an underserved minority population and establishing a multidisciplinary and collaborative effort between three major academic health care institutions in Puerto Rico. The major programmatic goals are to: 1) To enhance and integrate existing infrastructure for clinical and translational research to support and expand Clinical and Translational Research in the Health Disparities; 2) To enhance and support existing training and mentoring programs to increase the number of new minority investigators in Clinical and Translational Research; 3)To facilitate the translation of knowledge from the bench into the community. To accomplish these goals we will integrate, expand and enhance: 1) Participant and Clinical Interaction Resources 2) Clinical and Translational Research core resources in Biostatistics and Data Management 3) Core laboratories and technologies 4) Training and developmental programs 5) Support for regulatory compliance resources 6)informatic resources 7) Community interactions and participation programs. The proposed program will be integrative, incorporating resources and leadership from all three institutions, many of these under the RCMI-Clinical Research Center (RCMI-CRC) and the Comprehensive Center for Health Disparities (CCHD) but fusing under a single administrative structure.

"RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals who suffer from disproportionately high rates of premature morbidity and mortality, including racial and ethnic minorities, those of low socioeconomic status, and rural persons, are considered health disparity populations. ""Translational Research"", a bidirectional process focused on ""translating"" basic scientific discoveries into health interventions, and then into clinical practice to improve patient care and population health, has been proposed as an important approach to reduce health disparities. Connecting these populations to new health advances requires effective health education, engaging more minority participants in clinical trials, producing more minority investigators and enhancing research infrastructure at minority institutions. RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) have been developed to leverage the existing physical and intellectual resources and to promote and support relevant multi-site clinical and translational research focused on reducing health disparities and improving health outcomes. To build upon five years of infrastructure growth, the consortium of NIH-funded Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) has come together to submit for a renewal for the network. RTRN will continue to synergize and coordinate the considerable multidisciplinary talents of basic, clinical and community investigators to gain new knowledge about the social, economic, behavioral, cultural, environmental, perinatal and genetic determinants of health disparities. Based on the success of the first five years and the data arising from the RTRN evaluation, as well as critical input from the RCMI Steering and External Advisory Committees, the following specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: Enhance and streamline overall RTRN management and operations; Specific Aim 2: Engage RCMI investigators and other stakeholders, including the lay community, to strengthen capacity for multi-site clinical and translational research; Specific Aim 3: Enhance the infrastructure for project management, performance monitoring and data analysis; and Specific Aim 4.- Enhance the development and adoption of best practices for disseminating research findings to reduce health disparities and improve disease outcomes. By leveraging the research infrastructure and resources across RCMI grantee institutions, these four specific  aims will contribute to the overall goal of RTRN, which is to accelerate the quality and pace of transformative  research on diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnically diverse, low income, geographically  remote, and/or medically underserved populations.",RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN),8550829,U54MD008149,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Talents ', ' Translating ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved population ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Minority ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' population health ', ' operation ', ' ']",NIMHD,CHARLES R.

"University of New Mexico Clinical and Translational Science Center This proposal for a Clinical and Translational Science Center at the University of New Mexico Health  Sciences Center (HSC) will catalyze the emergence of a transformative, novel, and integrated academic  home for clinical and translational science at a flagship institution that serves the entire state of New Mexico  and the Southwestern region ofthe U.S. This center will have the infrastructure and consolidated resources  to: 1) synergize multi- and interdisciplinary clinical and translational research and researchers to catalyze the  application of new knowledge and techniques to clinical practice at the front lines of patient care; 2) recruit,  train, and advance well-trained interdisciplinary investigators and research teams with strength in cultural  sensitivity, health disparity, and biotechnology; 3) create an incubator for innovative research and information  technologies; and 4) expand existing partnerships between UNM Health Sciences Center (HSC) researchers,  practicing clinicians, and communities to speed the development of research. Our vision of the CTSC links  and focuses the efforts of our basic, clinical, and translational investigators, community clinicians, clinical  practices, health care and research collaborators, and industry partners. Since New Mexico has a high  proportion of ethnically diverse (i.e., Hispanic and Native American), rural, medically disenfranchised, and  health-disparate populations, a CTSC in New Mexico can uniquely address these problems. The UNM CTSC  will draw upon outstanding institutional commitment (at least $57,802,262 ) to achieve its goals. The UNM  CTSC possesses authority over the recruiting, hiring, protected time, expectations, promotion and tenure, and  evaluation of its faculty members. Evidence of the commitment and effectiveness of the UNM CTSC in these  pursuits are apparent from the following achievements made during the planning process: (1) reorganization  of the UNM HSC research mission under a new Vice President for Translational Research with authority over  research education, compliance and research functions, (2) establishment of an institutionally-funded K12-like  program, and recruitment of 5 junior faculty, (3) development of innovative new research education programs,  (4) operation of a functionally expanded Participant and Clinical Interactive Resources component that is  serving the needs of several community-based studies, including the landmark, new National Children's  Study, (5) the redesign of our institutional approach to Biomedical Informatics and development of a regional  clinical data warehouse that will be available to investigators using a $5.8 M investment, and (6) construction  and renovation of new buildings for the CTSC. Additionally, UNM's commitment includes $14.5 M in new  institutional funds committed to CTSC programs, and $8.5 M in matching funds to construct new space to  create a physical home for the CTSC. Funding of this proposal will assure sustainability and growth of these  transformations that is critically needed to support clinical and translational research at UNM.

In its first 4 years, the ITM has capitalized on the outstanding intellectual and physical resources throughout the University and ait ITM affiliate Institutions, Argonne National Laboratory, North Shore University Health System, Illinois Institute of Technology, and Access Community Health Network, and on substantial institutional and CTSA financial investments, to build the infrastructure for a transformative, energized, and self-improving home for clinical and translational research. The impact of the ITM has been greatest in 5 domains: 1) catalyzing the formation of multidisciplinary research teams; 2) establishing a systematic, organized clinical and translational research infrastructure; 3) engaging our community in research; 4) training for careers in clinical and translational team science; and 5) impact on and contributions to the National CTSA Consortium. Building on these, we propose to expand research and training opportunities with five major initiatives: a new TI Research and Technology Cluster; new Cores in Comparative Effectiveness Research and in Social, Environmental, and non-Biological Determinants of Health; a Personalizing Medicine initiative; a new Entrepreneurship Training and Support Program; and a Nurse-rScientist Training Program at new ITM affiliate Rush University. These programs, strengthened by community advice, engagement, partnership and participation, will ensure continued transformation of clinical and translational science at the University of Chicago and affiliates, on the South Side of Chicago, and beyond. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This program leverages the expertise of University of Chicago and affiliated investigators in a broad array of clinical and nonclinical fields to prepare the next generation of clinical and translational researchers to engage with our community partners to identify and prioritize a translational research agenda, and to address and reduce clinical health disparities in diverse adult and pediatric populations in our Community.",Re-Engineering Translational Research at the University of Chicago,8499464,KL2TR000431,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Chicago ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Evolution ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Illinois ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Nurses ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Residencies ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Entrepreneurship ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Community Health Networks ', ' Clinical Pathways ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Side ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' high school ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Population Study ', ' outreach ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Health system ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Qualifying ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' effectiveness research ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' translational medicine ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' doctoral student ', ' ']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,KL2,2013,413424,0.2258096958850205

"Kentucky Center for Clinical and Translational Science At the University of Kentucky (UK), we have established the Center for Clinical and Translational Science  (CCTS) as a home for clinical and translational research. UK is located in Lexington, on the western edge of  mid-Appalachia, one ofthe poorest areas ofthe country, where there are unprecedented disparities in  disease and mortality. Many of these disparities stem from risky behaviors, such as smoking, drug abuse,  and obesity. In this proposal, our overarching goal is to transform the pace, effectiveness, and quality of  translational research at UK which will result in better health for the people of mid-Appalachia. Scientific  discovery offers the potential for improved care, with community-based research offering a faster impact on  health through a better dissemination of optimal medical care. However, scientific discoveries often do not  reach the community due to the many difficulties with navigating the complex process of clinical and  translational research. In this application, we will capitalize on our strengths in education, basic and clinical  sciences, as well as our outstanding programs in practice- and community- based participatory research.  These efforts will result in scientific discovery that will impact the health ofthe Appalachian rural community  in the near term, and prime the pipeline for the future.

"HMORN UCSF Center for Diabetes Translational Research Diabetes mellitus is a significant health and cost burden in the United States. The evidence base for the prevention and care of T2DM is one of the most well-established of any chronic illness; however, the overall quality of care for diabetes remains sub-optimal, and to date relatively little attention has been paid to programs for preventing diabetes. Programs which can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-based diabetes prevention and treatment into widespread practice are desperately needed. In response to this need, diabetes researchers at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, HealthPartners Research Foundation, Harvard Pilgrim, and the University of California San Francisco, propose to create a Center for Diabetes Translational Research (CDTR) that will actively foster and support translational research in diabetes within health care delivery systems affiliated with the HMO Research Network (HMORN) and the State of California. The proposed HMORN-UCSF CDTR will achieve its aims by developing a multi-disciplinary network of well-established investigators with a strong history of receiving both federal and foundation funding in diabetes translational research. This CDTR will be structured around three Translational Research Cores in the areas of health care disparities, diabetes and obesity prevention, and the use of health information technology to improve diabetes care. The proposed CDTR investigators have significant experience in translational research in T2DM care and prevention in both adults and children, as well as in pregnant women with gestational diabetes (GDM). These investigators have strong relationships with care delivery systems, ranging from large integrated delivery systems to networks of safety net providers, that can serve as important partners for translating effective interventions into real-world clinical settings.  The Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, HealthPartners Research Foundation, Harvard Pilgrim, and the University of California San Francisco propose to create a Center for Diabetes Translational Research that will actively support and foster translational research in Type 2 diabetes prevention and care.",HMORN UCSF Center for Diabetes Translational Research,8728205,P30DK092924,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' California ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Insurance ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' pregnancy diabetes ', ' Pregnancy-Induced Diabetes ', ' Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Gestational Diabetes ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Integrated Delivery Systems ', ' Staging ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Data ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' obesity prevention ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' diabetes control ', ' health information technology ', ' ']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,P30,2014,421101,0.11011296023652409

"RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals who suffer from disproportionately high rates of premature morbidity and mortality, including racial and ethnic minorities, those of low socioeconomic status, and rural persons, are considered health disparity populations. ""Translational Research"", a bidirectional process focused on ""translating"" basic scientific discoveries into health interventions, and then into clinical practice to improve patient care and population health, has been proposed as an important approach to reduce health disparities. Connecting these populations to new health advances requires effective health education, engaging more minority participants in clinical trials, producing more minority investigators and enhancing research infrastructure at minority institutions. RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) have been developed to leverage the existing physical and intellectual resources and to promote and support relevant multi-site clinical and translational research focused on reducing health disparities and improving health outcomes. To build upon five years of infrastructure growth, the consortium of NIH-funded Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) has come together to submit for a renewal for the network. RTRN will continue to synergize and coordinate the considerable multidisciplinary talents of basic, clinical and community investigators to gain new knowledge about the social, economic, behavioral, cultural, environmental, perinatal and genetic determinants of health disparities. Based on the success of the first five years and the data arising from the RTRN evaluation, as well as critical input from the RCMI Steering and External Advisory Committees, the following specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: Enhance and streamline overall RTRN management and operations; Specific Aim 2: Engage RCMI investigators and other stakeholders, including the lay community, to strengthen capacity for multi-site clinical and translational research; Specific Aim 3: Enhance the infrastructure for project management, performance monitoring and data analysis; and Specific Aim 4.- Enhance the development and adoption of best practices for disseminating research findings to reduce health disparities and improve disease outcomes. By leveraging the research infrastructure and resources across RCMI grantee institutions, these four specific  aims will contribute to the overall goal of RTRN, which is to accelerate the quality and pace of transformative  research on diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnically diverse, low income, geographically  remote, and/or medically underserved populations.",RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN),8727317,U54MD008149,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Talents ', ' Translating ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved population ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Minority ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' population health ', ' operation ', ' ']",NIMHD,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2014,4221291,0.1566078693431621
"Institutional Clinical and Translational Science Award The University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) and its partner, Marshfield Clinic, remain committed to the challenge of transforming the research culture and environment to further develop clinical and translational science as a distinct discipline. UW approaches this challenge with the unique perspective afforded by the ongoing transformation of the Medical School to a School of Medicine and Public Health, which has mandated creation of a health delivery system based on effective application of current knowledge by turning it into current practice. Achieving this goal is facilitated by the strength UW derives from a strong and committed partnership forged by its Health Sciences Schools/College and Marshfield Clinic. Over the past four years, the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR), formed as the vehicle to achieve the cultural transformation, has coupled a catalytic investment of new resources with the integration, synergy, and amplification of existing resources to forge substantive changes in the research environment and culture for clinical and translational research. Our key goal will continue: to create an environment that facilitates transformation of research at the UW and Marshfield Clinic into a continuum extending from investigation to discovery to translation into practice. To achieve this goal, ICTR will further stimulate the creation of interdisciplinary teams, make available state-of-the-art core facilities, expand biostatistical and biomedical informatics resources, forge new partnerships with community organizations, and encourage research participation in the continuum of translational sciences. ICTR will continue to develop a cadre of multidisciplinary biomedical and behavioral scientists capable of accelerating translation of research findings into evidence-based policies and practices, which will improve health in the U.S'. Such outcomes will be facilitated by the formation of interdisciplinary research teams, which bridge the gulf between the basic scientists at the University and community partners, selected from an extensive well-developed clinical network in Wisconsin. These initiatives will further stimulate evolution of the research culture to fulfill the ""Wisconsin Idea,"" a concept linking University efforts to the well-being of the residents in Wisconsin. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The University of Wisconsin-Madison and Marshfield Clinic are committed to support multidisciplinary biomedical and behavioral research that spans basic science to clinical research, often done collaboratively with community partners and to assure that the results of these studies are disseminated to communities to positively impact on health care in the community and the health of community members.",Institutional Clinical and Translational Science Award,8676965,KL2TR000428,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Animals ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Scholarship ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Writing ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Metric ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Core Facility ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Instruction ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' forging ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' health equity ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' ']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,KL2,2014,1289380,0.1738378368833836

"Mentored postdoctoral training in health disparities and community-partnered part     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed CRECD Program at Charles R. Drew University (CDU), Mentored Postdoctoral Training in Translational Research, is a Phase II mentored clinical research and career development program designed to develop a diverse cadre of clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases, in particular those diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States (e.g., HIV/AIDS, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mental health/psychiatric disorders), and to foster and facilitate professional development activities in clinical and translational sciences. Over the initial 5-year program period, the CRECD Program will accept a total of eight postdoctoral trainees at the junior faculty level at CDU, each for 3-year appointments, staggered in appointment periods. The CRECD Program will be embedded within the existing, extensive clinical research and training infrastructure at CDU, and thus will mutually leverage resources with other CDU research education and career development programs so as to achieve maximal cross-program synergies as well as efficiencies wrought from utilizing already-in-place education and training curricula and related resources germane to the CRECD agenda. However, the CRECD Program will also carve out a unique niche of training and career development opportunities within the broader CDU science-generating ""critical mass"" by (1) focusing exclusively on health disparities and mastery of community-partnered participatory methods in the research and research training agenda and (2) providing to each trainee a first-of-its-kind (at CDU and, by our estimate, nationwide) intensive and community-immersive mentoring configuration that includes CDU faculty from both the standard or conventional Academic Career track and the newly emerging Community Faculty track, called the Partnership for Equity and Equality in Health and Wellness. This intensive mentoring innovation directly emerges from, and formalizes and systematizes into a signature trainee mentoring configuration, a long and fruitful history of community-engaged research, training, and educational curricula at CDU. As an integrated research training and career development package, this approach is designed to bring social determinants of health to the forefront of molecular and clinical research. Ultimately, the goal is to increase the impact of community- academic partnered research and adoption of its evidence-based best practices through comprehensive dissemination of research findings so as to encourage and facilitate implementation of evidence-based treatment and prevention practices within health care organizations and the communities most in need of reliable access to high-quality care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): By providing an outstanding and intensive research mentoring, training, and career development opportunity to minority and other underrepresented postdoctoral scholars in the translational sciences, this new program at Charles Drew University will increase the diversity of the scientific workforce and develop next-generation clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases, in particular those diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States.            ",Mentored postdoctoral training in health disparities and community-partnered part,8654506,R25MD007610,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Adoption ', ' Appointment ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Industry ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Private Sector ', ' Public Sector ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Scholarship ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' Science ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Training and Education ', ' health care organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' career development ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' dissemination research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' social health determinants ', ' ']",NIMHD,CHARLES R.

"Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network IDeA-CTR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is compelling need for a Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network (CTR-IN) to serve the seven Western Region IDeA states (AK HI, ID, MT, NM NV and WY) our states cover 1/3 of the US and mass yet currently contribute little to clinical and translational science. The CTR-IN will provide infrastructure and centralized services in support of institutions that for the most part have successful programs in basic science, but little or no tradition or capacity in clinical or translational research. Eleven of the 13 partners in this proposal have minimal resources to support faculty in this work. The other two With CTSA and RCMI support are relatively small but eager to help the others. Our mission is to increase the quantity, quality, and competitive, peer-reviewed support for clinical and translational research across these 7 states thereby accelerating the translation and application of scientific discovery improve health in our region and elsewhere. Academic institutions in this region share common challenges in building these research capabilities in under-resourced environments that are geographically large and rural. With ethnically diverse populations many of which are impoverished with poor access to care, including vulnerable subgroups with significant health disparities. We will provide education mentoring, study design. bio statistical and study design support. and a variety of opportunities (pilot grants, mini-sabbaticals and visiting scholarships} for exposure to levels of science and clinical research environments that are simply not available to faculty at their home institutions An essential element of our proposal is a robust internet presence that will provide the asynchronous access to Information and services essential in our area which spans 4 time zones. Our network will also support high bandwidth synchronous communication for video conferencing, seminars and similar unifying events that will efficiently bring state-of-the-art science and resources w isolated partners. To accomplish our mission, we will partner with the University of New Mexico CTSC and the RCMI program at the University of Hawaii to extend their expertise and leverage their resources across the region.

"Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science: A Partnership to Improve Health San Antonio, the gateway to South Texas, is the 7*^ largest city in the US and the largest metropolitan area with a majority Hispanic population (63%). South Texas is about the size of Ohio, and comprises an impoverished and largely Hispanic population with disproportionate rates of diabetes and obesity, exacerbated by a lack of health insurance and poor access to health care. This region also contains numerous US military installations, and active-duty service members and veterans often have special health issues, including Increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic injuries. Unfortunately, neither better access to care nor improved care delivery can eliminate health disparities and meet these complex needs, in addition, research across the full T l to T4 translational spectrum is required to eliminate knowledge gaps and establish real-world effectiveness that improves health care for our populations.  In 2006, UTHSCSA established the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science (IIMS) to improve health and reduce disparities by accelerating scientific discoveries and applications across the full translational research spectrum. For example, IIMS expanded the number of clinical research units that extend to the Texas-Mexico border from 1 to 7, and dramatically increasing participant access to clinical and translational science. We increased, from 2 to 6, the Practice-Based Research Networks that focus on diverse ambulatory populations. Efforts to address translational science workforce needs over the past 5-10 years have graduated 100 Masters Clinical Investigation students, supported 19 successful KL2 Scholars, and established new joint Translational Science PhD and Certificate programs. In this proposal, we provide strategies to spur clinical and translational science evolution, catalyze research teams, and implement programs that produce creative, collaborative, and culturally diverse scientists. Our Specific Aims will: 1. Accelerate clinical and translational research innovation and effective team science along the  entire 11 to T4 research spectrum by providing an academic home integrated with our strategic  partner institutions. 2.

"Institutional Clinical and Translational Science Award The University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) and its partner, Marshfield Clinic, remain committed to the challenge of transforming the research culture and environment to further develop clinical and translational science as a distinct discipline. UW approaches this challenge with the unique perspective afforded by the ongoing transformation of the Medical School to a School of Medicine and Public Health, which has mandated creation of a health delivery system based on effective application of current knowledge by turning it into current practice. Achieving this goal is facilitated by the strength UW derives from a strong and committed partnership forged by its Health Sciences Schools/College and Marshfield Clinic. Over the past four years, the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR), formed as the vehicle to achieve the cultural transformation, has coupled a catalytic investment of new resources with the integration, synergy, and amplification of existing resources to forge substantive changes in the research environment and culture for clinical and translational research. Our key goal will continue: to create an environment that facilitates transformation of research at the UW and Marshfield Clinic into a continuum extending from investigation to discovery to translation into practice. To achieve this goal, ICTR will further stimulate the creation of interdisciplinary teams, make available state-of-the-art core facilities, expand biostatistical and biomedical informatics resources, forge new partnerships with community organizations, and encourage research participation in the continuum of translational sciences. ICTR will continue to develop a cadre of multidisciplinary biomedical and behavioral scientists capable of accelerating translation of research findings into evidence-based policies and practices, which will improve health in the U.S'. Such outcomes will be facilitated by the formation of interdisciplinary research teams, which bridge the gulf between the basic scientists at the University and community partners, selected from an extensive well-developed clinical network in Wisconsin. These initiatives will further stimulate evolution of the research culture to fulfill the ""Wisconsin Idea,"" a concept linking University efforts to the well-being of the residents in Wisconsin. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The University of Wisconsin-Madison and Marshfield Clinic are committed to support multidisciplinary biomedical and behavioral research that spans basic science to clinical research, often done collaboratively with community partners and to assure that the results of these studies are disseminated to communities to positively impact on health care in the community and the health of community members.",Institutional Clinical and Translational Science Award,8869069,KL2TR000428,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Animals ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Scholarship ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Writing ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Core Facility ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Instruction ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' forging ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' health equity ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' ']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,KL2,2015,1283798,0.1738378368833836
"Kentucky Center for Clinical and Translational Science At the University of Kentucky (UK), we have established the Center for Clinical and Translational Science  (CCTS) as a home for clinical and translational research. UK is located in Lexington, on the western edge of  mid-Appalachia, one ofthe poorest areas ofthe country, where there are unprecedented disparities in  disease and mortality. Many of these disparities stem from risky behaviors, such as smoking, drug abuse,  and obesity. In this proposal, our overarching goal is to transform the pace, effectiveness, and quality of  translational research at UK which will result in better health for the people of mid-Appalachia. Scientific  discovery offers the potential for improved care, with community-based research offering a faster impact on  health through a better dissemination of optimal medical care. However, scientific discoveries often do not  reach the community due to the many difficulties with navigating the complex process of clinical and  translational research. In this application, we will capitalize on our strengths in education, basic and clinical  sciences, as well as our outstanding programs in practice- and community- based participatory research.  These efforts will result in scientific discovery that will impact the health ofthe Appalachian rural community  in the near term, and prime the pipeline for the future. To accomplish these goals, UK will form a  collaboration with Marshall University, which is 2 hr away in Huntington, WV. In addition, we will form an  Appalachian Translational Reseach Network involving not only Marshall, but also the CTSAs at the Ohio  State University, University of Cinncinati, Morehead University, and Pikeville School of Osteopathic  Medicine. This network will be especially important in the further development of our strong programs in  community based participatory research.

"HMORN UCSF Center for Diabetes Translational Research Diabetes mellitus is a significant health and cost burden in the United States. The evidence base for the prevention and care of T2DM is one of the most well-established of any chronic illness; however, the overall quality of care for diabetes remains sub-optimal, and to date relatively little attention has been paid to programs for preventing diabetes. Programs which can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-based diabetes prevention and treatment into widespread practice are desperately needed. In response to this need, diabetes researchers at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, HealthPartners Research Foundation, Harvard Pilgrim, and the University of California San Francisco, propose to create a Center for Diabetes Translational Research (CDTR) that will actively foster and support translational research in diabetes within health care delivery systems affiliated with the HMO Research Network (HMORN) and the State of California. The proposed HMORN-UCSF CDTR will achieve its aims by developing a multi-disciplinary network of well-established investigators with a strong history of receiving both federal and foundation funding in diabetes translational research. This CDTR will be structured around three Translational Research Cores in the areas of health care disparities, diabetes and obesity prevention, and the use of health information technology to improve diabetes care. The proposed CDTR investigators have significant experience in translational research in T2DM care and prevention in both adults and children, as well as in pregnant women with gestational diabetes (GDM). These investigators have strong relationships with care delivery systems, ranging from large integrated delivery systems to networks of safety net providers, that can serve as important partners for translating effective interventions into real-world clinical settings.  The Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, HealthPartners Research Foundation, Harvard Pilgrim, and the University of California San Francisco propose to create a Center for Diabetes Translational Research that will actively support and foster translational research in Type 2 diabetes prevention and care.",HMORN UCSF Center for Diabetes Translational Research,8928147,P30DK092924,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' California ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Insurance ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Gestational Diabetes ', ' pregnancy diabetes ', ' Pregnancy-Induced Diabetes ', ' Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Integrated Delivery Systems ', ' Staging ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Data ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' obesity prevention ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' diabetes control ', ' health information technology ', ' ']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,P30,2015,419393,0.11011296023652409
"Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science: A Partnership to Improve Health San Antonio, the gateway to South Texas, is the 7""^ largest city in the US and the largest metropolitan area with a majority Hispanic population (63%). South Texas is about the size of Ohio, and comprises an impoverished and largely Hispanic population with disproportionate rates of diabetes and obesity, exacerbated by a lack of health insurance and poor access to health care. This region also contains numerous US military installations, and active-duty service members and veterans often have special health issues, including increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic injuries. Unfortunately, neither better access to care nor improved care delivery can eliminate health disparities and meet these complex needs. In addition, research across the full T l to T4 translational spectrum is required to eliminate knowledge gaps and establish real-world effectiveness that improves health cai^e for our populations.  In 2006, UTHSCSA established the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science (IIMS) to improve health and reduce disparities by accelerating scientific discoveries and applications across the full translational research spectrum. For example, IIMS expanded the number of clinical research units that extend to the Texas-Mexico border from 1 to 7, and dramatically increasing participant access to clinical and translational science. We increased, from 2 to 6, the Practice-Based Research Networks that focus on diverse ambulatory populations. Efforts to address translational science workforce needs over the past 5-10 years have graduated 100 Masters Clinical Investigation students, supported 19 successful KL2 Scholars, and established new joint Translational Science PhD and Certificate programs. In this proposal, we provide strategies to spur clinical and translational science evolution, catalyze research teams, and implement programs that produce creative, collaborative, and culturally diverse scientists. Our Specific Aims will: 1. Accelerate clinical and translational research innovation and effective team science along the  entire T1 to 14 research spectrum by providing an academic home integrated with our strategic  partner institutions. 2. Expand, diversify, and enhance the workforce of interdisciplinary translational biomedical scientists. 3. Implement effective methods to continuously evaluate and optimize services, increase  efficiencies, improve processes, and reduce costs across all IIMS programs. RELEVANCE (See instructions); Based on our vision of improving the health status of South Texas by accelerating scientific discoveries and public health applications, we will deploy strategic resources that focus on prevalent challenges in our region, including: 1) the health needs of our underserved Hispanic population, 2) the special health issues facing active-duty military and veteran populations, and 3) limitations in the translational science workforce required to fill in critical knowledge gaps and improve health in South Texas and the US.

"Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network IDeA-CTR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is compelling need for a Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network (CTR-IN) to serve the seven Western Region IDeA states (AK HI, ID, MT, NM NV and WY) our states cover 1/3 of the US and mass yet currently contribute little to clinical and translational science. The CTR-IN will provide infrastructure and centralized services in support of institutions that for the most part have successful programs in basic science, but little or no tradition or capacity in clinical or translational research. Eleven of the 13 partners in this proposal have minimal resources to support faculty in this work. The other two With CTSA and RCMI support are relatively small but eager to help the others. Our mission is to increase the quantity, quality, and competitive, peer-reviewed support for clinical and translational research across these 7 states thereby accelerating the translation and application of scientific discovery improve health in our region and elsewhere. Academic institutions in this region share common challenges in building these research capabilities in under-resourced environments that are geographically large and rural. With ethnically diverse populations many of which are impoverished with poor access to care, including vulnerable subgroups with significant health disparities. We will provide education mentoring, study design. bio statistical and study design support. and a variety of opportunities (pilot grants, mini-sabbaticals and visiting scholarships} for exposure to levels of science and clinical research environments that are simply not available to faculty at their home institutions An essential element of our proposal is a robust internet presence that will provide the asynchronous access to Information and services essential in our area which spans 4 time zones. Our network will also support high bandwidth synchronous communication for video conferencing, seminars and similar unifying events that will efficiently bring state-of-the-art science and resources w isolated partners. To accomplish our mission, we will partner with the University of New Mexico CTSC and the RCMI program at the University of Hawaii to extend their expertise and leverage their resources across the region. We will also leverage resources with the RCMI Translational Science Network (RTRN). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The 7 Western Region IDeA states lack adequate infrastructure and expertise to conduct clinical and translational research addressing regional health issues affecting our remote, culturally diverse, underserved populations.

"UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) Contact PD/PI: Kimberly, Robert P The vision of the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) Hub is to reduce health disparities in diseases disproportionately represented within the Deep South as we accelerate discovery to improve human health. We have established a robust Partner Network – spanning Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana – to ensure that our research and training efforts serve the special populations in our region while maximizing collaborative synergies in translational research (Aim 1). We promote the continued development of a diverse, multidisciplinary research workforce representing all career stages, by supporting a broad portfolio of NRSA training, mentored career development, content specific educational programs and experiential learning opportunities (Aim 2). These initiatives deepen scientific understanding of clinical and translational science, establish core competencies and advance the knowledge base in good clinical practice, study design, bioethics, conduct of clinical trials and team science. The CCTS supports ethical, scientifically rigorous clinical trials and pilot research across the CCTS Partner Network (Aim 3) through focused efforts to provide resources, specialized services and consultation in genomics, informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, clinical research, advanced imaging and drug discovery. The CCTS fosters the application of best practices, including those established by the CTSA Consortium, and will promote tools that enable the rapid and efficient execution of multi-site clinical trials, taking advantage of the electronic health record to inform feasibility and access to study populations. Importantly, in keeping with our goal of reducing regional health disparities, we recognize the importance of engaging our communities in the planning and conduct of research (Aim 4). Through our community engagement arm – One Great Community – we are expanding programmatic outreach by taking successful community-based participatory research approaches to a regional scale. Finally, we understand the importance of evaluating the activities of the CCTS Partner Network to ensure that we are accomplishing our goals (Aim 5). Didactic programs, community engagement and research processes are evaluated by a panel of tailored and common metrics to guide strategies and outline progress towards achieving defined goals. By achieving these aims, the CCTS Partner Network will accelerate clinical and translational research in the Deep South and advance the amelioration the significant health disparities faced by our populations. Further, the CCTS Hub and its Partner Network will be well-positioned to work with other hubs and the CTSA Consortium in the dissemination of best practices in clinical and translational research and training. Project Summary/Abstract Page 248 Contact PD/PI: Kimberly, Robert P PROJECT NARRATIVE The UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) and its regional Partner Network of ten institutions in the Deep South are dedicated to lessening health disparities and the disproportionate burden of disease in our population. We will accomplish these goals by supporting cutting-edge translational research, pursuing novel team science-driven investigation into new therapies and health care delivery paradigms, and developing the next generation of a diverse, highly-trained clinical and translational research workforce to tackle health challenges.

"Kentucky Center for Clinical and Translational Science At the University of Kentucky (UK), we have established the Center for Clinical and Translational Science  (CCTS) as a home for clinical and translational research. UK is located in Lexington, on the western edge of  mid-Appalachia, one ofthe poorest areas ofthe country, where there are unprecedented disparities in  disease and mortality. Many of these disparities stem from risky behaviors, such as smoking, drug abuse,  and obesity. In this proposal, our overarching goal is to transform the pace, effectiveness, and quality of  translational research at UK which will result in better health for the people of mid-Appalachia. Scientific  discovery offers the potential for improved care, with community-based research offering a faster impact on  health through a better dissemination of optimal medical care. However, scientific discoveries often do not  reach the community due to the many difficulties with navigating the complex process of clinical and  translational research. In this application, we will capitalize on our strengths in education, basic and clinical  sciences, as well as our outstanding programs in practice- and community- based participatory research.  These efforts will result in scientific discovery that will impact the health ofthe Appalachian rural community  in the near term, and prime the pipeline for the future. To accomplish these goals, UK will form a  collaboration with Marshall University, which is 2 hr away in Huntington, WV. In addition, we will form an  Appalachian Translational Reseach Network involving not only Marshall, but also the CTSAs at the Ohio  State University, University of Cinncinati, Morehead University, and Pikeville School of Osteopathic  Medicine. This network will be especially important in the further development of our strong programs in  community based participatory research. To help integrate our efforts, we have developed an innovative  group of faculty CATalysts, who will build collaborative team science programs backed by generous pilot  funding that will target novel ideas at all levels of science. New CCTS programs in ""Drug Development"",  ""Novel Methodologies"", and ""Risk-Related Behavior Research"" will capitalize on our strengths, engage  investigators with diverse areas of expertise, and will more quickly impact the health ofthe Appalachian  community. We have recently recruited a new leader in Biomedical Informatics and have invested heavily in  this program, which will greatly improve our ability to transform data into knowledge throughout the CCTS.  Through these initiatives, UK will fulfill its mandate as Kentucky's flagship university to improve the health of  Central Appalachia, and thereby add unique value to improvements in the health ofthe nation. RELEVANCE (See Instructions):  The CCTS at UK has developed well-integrated relationships with University programs in Central Appalachia  and with rural health programs. We routinely apply a foundation principal of community based participatory  research, where the lay community identifies the research issues and co-develops solutions.

"Mentored postdoctoral training in health disparities and community-partnered part     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed CRECD Program at Charles R. Drew University (CDU), Mentored Postdoctoral Training in Translational Research, is a Phase II mentored clinical research and career development program designed to develop a diverse cadre of clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases, in particular those diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States (e.g., HIV/AIDS, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mental health/psychiatric disorders), and to foster and facilitate professional development activities in clinical and translational sciences. Over the initial 5-year program period, the CRECD Program will accept a total of eight postdoctoral trainees at the junior faculty level at CDU, each for 3-year appointments, staggered in appointment periods. The CRECD Program will be embedded within the existing, extensive clinical research and training infrastructure at CDU, and thus will mutually leverage resources with other CDU research education and career development programs so as to achieve maximal cross-program synergies as well as efficiencies wrought from utilizing already-in-place education and training curricula and related resources germane to the CRECD agenda. However, the CRECD Program will also carve out a unique niche of training and career development opportunities within the broader CDU science-generating ""critical mass"" by (1) focusing exclusively on health disparities and mastery of community-partnered participatory methods in the research and research training agenda and (2) providing to each trainee a first-of-its-kind (at CDU and, by our estimate, nationwide) intensive and community-immersive mentoring configuration that includes CDU faculty from both the standard or conventional Academic Career track and the newly emerging Community Faculty track, called the Partnership for Equity and Equality in Health and Wellness. This intensive mentoring innovation directly emerges from, and formalizes and systematizes into a signature trainee mentoring configuration, a long and fruitful history of community-engaged research, training, and educational curricula at CDU. As an integrated research training and career development package, this approach is designed to bring social determinants of health to the forefront of molecular and clinical research. Ultimately, the goal is to increase the impact of community- academic partnered research and adoption of its evidence-based best practices through comprehensive dissemination of research findings so as to encourage and facilitate implementation of evidence-based treatment and prevention practices within health care organizations and the communities most in need of reliable access to high-quality care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): By providing an outstanding and intensive research mentoring, training, and career development opportunity to minority and other underrepresented postdoctoral scholars in the translational sciences, this new program at Charles Drew University will increase the diversity of the scientific workforce and develop next-generation clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases, in particular those diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States.            ",Mentored postdoctoral training in health disparities and community-partnered part,8840841,R25MD007610,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Adoption ', ' Appointment ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Industry ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Private Sector ', ' Public Sector ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Scholarship ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' Science ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Training and Education ', ' health care organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' career development ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' dissemination research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' social health determinants ', ' ']",NIMHD,CHARLES R.

"RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals who suffer from disproportionately high rates of premature morbidity and mortality, including racial and ethnic minorities, those of low socioeconomic status, and rural persons, are considered health disparity populations. ""Translational Research"", a bidirectional process focused on ""translating"" basic scientific discoveries into health interventions, and then into clinical practice to improve patient care and population health, has been proposed as an important approach to reduce health disparities. Connecting these populations to new health advances requires effective health education, engaging more minority participants in clinical trials, producing more minority investigators and enhancing research infrastructure at minority institutions. RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) have been developed to leverage the existing physical and intellectual resources and to promote and support relevant multi-site clinical and translational research focused on reducing health disparities and improving health outcomes. To build upon five years of infrastructure growth, the consortium of NIH-funded Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) has come together to submit for a renewal for the network. RTRN will continue to synergize and coordinate the considerable multidisciplinary talents of basic, clinical and community investigators to gain new knowledge about the social, economic, behavioral, cultural, environmental, perinatal and genetic determinants of health disparities. Based on the success of the first five years and the data arising from the RTRN evaluation, as well as critical input from the RCMI Steering and External Advisory Committees, the following specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: Enhance and streamline overall RTRN management and operations; Specific Aim 2: Engage RCMI investigators and other stakeholders, including the lay community, to strengthen capacity for multi-site clinical and translational research; Specific Aim 3: Enhance the infrastructure for project management, performance monitoring and data analysis; and Specific Aim 4.- Enhance the development and adoption of best practices for disseminating research findings to reduce health disparities and improve disease outcomes. By leveraging the research infrastructure and resources across RCMI grantee institutions, these four specific  aims will contribute to the overall goal of RTRN, which is to accelerate the quality and pace of transformative  research on diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnically diverse, low income, geographically  remote, and/or medically underserved populations.",RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN),8908922,U54MD008149,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Talents ', ' Translating ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved population ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Minority ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' population health ', ' operation ', ' ']",NIMHD,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2015,4076333,0.1566078693431621
"Re-Engineering Translational Research at the University of Chicago The University of Chicago (UC) Institute for Translational Medicine (ITM) was created in 2007 to assemble, integrate, and create the intellectual, administrative, and physical resources required to catalyze research and research training in Clinical and Translational Science. Its ultimate goals are to train scientists and health care providers at UC and in our community to determine the molecular, genetic, pathophysiologic and social determinants of disease and disease predisposition in individuals; to test interventions directed toward those mechanisms; and to achieve these goals in a way that is rigorous, efficient, ethical, respectful of, and responsive to our community's needs and values. In its first 4 years, the ITM has capitalized on the outstanding intellectual and physical resources throughout the University and ait ITM affiliate Institutions, Argonne National Laboratory, North Shore University Health System, Illinois Institute of Technology, and Access Community Health Network, and on substantial institutional and CTSA financial investments, to build the infrastructure for a transformative, energized, and self-improving home for clinical and translational research.

"Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center ABSTRACT The overall goal the Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC) Translational Workforce Development component is training and development of an interprofessional, interdisciplinary, and ethnically/racially/culturally diverse clinical and translational workforce with skills to meet the health care needs of our community, the region and the nation. The KL2 Mentored Career Development Program (KL2 Program) will engage talented and motivated scholars in any health science discipline (including medicine, nursing, dental, pharmacy, public health) to join the clinical and translational science workforce to develop new diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic interventions for diseases with emphasis on addressing health disparities affecting our communities. We will train scholars to use an interdisciplinary approach to translate basic and clinical advances into improved healthcare. We will develop an ethnic/racial/culturally diverse workforce to overcome the growing divide between clinical and research careers, and to address health inequities in communities such as Buffalo. Buffalo is the 3rd poorest city in the country, where over 50% of its population belongs to traditional underrepresented [(AA (39%), HA (11%), NA/PI (0.8%)] (2010 Census) and/or underserved minorities. Refugees represent over 5% of the Buffalo population. The goal of this KL2 Program is to train at least four junior faculty/physician scientist scholars by supporting them for two years with the expectation that, with training and mentor assistance, they secure an additional three years of individual funding through K awards to complete the five-year training program. The program is complemented by and integrated with an institutionally funded Dean's Scholars program, which allows us to train 6 additional scholars under the same terms. There will be 5 scholars in the program in Years 1 and 2 and 10 thereafter. We will focus on recruiting individuals from underrepresented backgrounds in health science professions. The program has four specific aims: 1) Attract, engage, and train in state-of-the-art clinical and translational science and a broad range of health science disciplines talented and motivated early career investigators who come from underrepresented groups or disadvantaged backgrounds and/or bring new perspectives to health disparities challenges; 2) Develop comprehensive mentoring programs for mentors and trainees tailored to individual needs; 3) Promote pathways to independence by fostering inter-professional and inter-disciplinary training for scholars to master team science concepts; and 4) Empower our Community of Scholars to collaborate and identify new areas of engagement with other CTSA hubs. The program will train and develop KL2 Scholars' professional skills and facilitate a seamless transition to their next career level within the clinical and translational workforce pipeline. KL2 Scholars, as leaders of the CTSA Community of Scholars, will have the opportunity to give back by providing mentoring and guidance in the discipline to students and peers from our community, the region, and nationwide through the CTSA consortium.

"Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center Contact PD/PI: Murphy, Timothy F Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes 12 major academic, research and healthcare institutions and 5 influential community partners in our region, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The distribution of underrepresented minorities who experience health disparities in Buffalo in 2015 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 35 years. The vision for our CTSA hub is to develop, test and share novel approaches to improve health and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Improving health in our community and the nation will require innovative research across the full T1 through T4 translational spectrum. In 2012, the University at Buffalo opened the new 170,000 ft2 state-of-the-art Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) devoted entirely to clinical and translational research. The CTRC provides a centralized facility, including translational research laboratories, a clinical research center, an imaging center, a lab animal facility and a biorepository. The CTRC and other enormous BTC investments to build a 21st century Academic Health Center creates a setting for a CTSA to provide the key piece to transform our capacity to bring discoveries in the laboratory, the clinic and the community to benefit individual and public health by sharing expertise and innovative approaches to translational science as part of the national consortium. We will bring strengths to the CTSA consortium, including developing novel health informatics tools, leveraging our strength as a leading center on research in standards and ontologies; new approaches to community-based research developed with our community; testing and disseminating ontology-based methods to share translational image data; and one of the few full service Drug Development Services in the consortium.  With a CTSA we will 1) accelerate the development, implementation and dissemination of new healthcare interventions and their translation into the community through innovative research across the T1 through T4 spectrum, 2) train and develop an excellent and diverse workforce to ensure that translational researchers and their teams have the skills and knowledge to advance translation of discoveries, 3) build a translational science pipeline that integrates data from multiple sources and combines data analysis methods to discover diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive interventions, and 4) streamline clinical research processes with a focus on quality to enhance recruitment of special populations across the lifespan and groups with health disparities, and accelerate multi-site clinical trial initiation. Building on our unique strengths will enhance both our local and national CTSA network capacity through collaboration and sharing expertise and resources.

The specific aims of this application are: (1) to strengthen research education and career development in Puerto Rico through the implementation of the revised post-doctoral Master of Science in Clinical and Translational Research (MCTR) curriculum; and (2) to develop a diverse group of Hispanic scientists with the necessary knowledge and skills to pursue clinical and translational research, particularly in diseases and healthcare conditions that disproportionately impact minority populations. To further these aims, we propose to strengthen the current post-doctoral program by increasing collaboration with other research training programs, intensifying research mentoring opportunities, and continuing to evaluate our efforts. These enhanced opportunities will ensure that Scholars will participate in on-going faculty research, research seminars, and national conferences. They will also receive publication, presentation, research dissemination, and grantsmanship experiences. We will strengthen the research capacity of the MCTR program through highly trained and experienced faculty and investigators who have productive track records in clinical and translational research in the areas of interest. The formation of thi new generation of clinical and translational investigators will be encouraged by providing administrative, physical, and fiscal support. This Hispanic Clinical and Translational Research Education and Career Development (HCTRECD) program is being further strengthened by fostering partnerships with the community, industry and national research-intensive institutions interested in addressing significant questions in minority health issues. Our ultimate goal is to enhance the participation of minority health professionals in clinical and translational research that will have a significant impact on the health of the community, particularly underrepresented minorities.          (provided by applicant): The proposed Hispanic Clinical and Translational Research Education and Career Development (HCTRECD) program will help support the efforts of the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus' (UPR-MSC) to increase diversity and the representation of Hispanic clinicians, physicians and scientists well prepared to assume the role of leaders in clinical and translational science that carry out research that address health disparities and improve minority health.

"Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network IDeA-CTR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is compelling need for a Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network (CTR-IN) to serve the seven Western Region IDeA states (AK HI, ID, MT, NM NV and WY) our states cover 1/3 of the US and mass yet currently contribute little to clinical and translational science. The CTR-IN will provide infrastructure and centralized services in support of institutions that for the most part have successful programs in basic science, but little or no tradition or capacity in clinical or translational research. Eleven of the 13 partners in this proposal have minimal resources to support faculty in this work. The other two With CTSA and RCMI support are relatively small but eager to help the others. Our mission is to increase the quantity, quality, and competitive, peer-reviewed support for clinical and translational research across these 7 states thereby accelerating the translation and application of scientific discovery improve health in our region and elsewhere. Academic institutions in this region share common challenges in building these research capabilities in under-resourced environments that are geographically large and rural. With ethnically diverse populations many of which are impoverished with poor access to care, including vulnerable subgroups with significant health disparities. We will provide education mentoring, study design. bio statistical and study design support. and a variety of opportunities (pilot grants, mini-sabbaticals and visiting scholarships} for exposure to levels of science and clinical research environments that are simply not available to faculty at their home institutions An essential element of our proposal is a robust internet presence that will provide the asynchronous access to Information and services essential in our area which spans 4 time zones. Our network will also support high bandwidth synchronous communication for video conferencing, seminars and similar unifying events that will efficiently bring state-of-the-art science and resources w isolated partners. To accomplish our mission, we will partner with the University of New Mexico CTSC and the RCMI program at the University of Hawaii to extend their expertise and leverage their resources across the region. We will also leverage resources with the RCMI Translational Science Network (RTRN). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The 7 Western Region IDeA states lack adequate infrastructure and expertise to conduct clinical and translational research addressing regional health issues affecting our remote, culturally diverse, underserved populations. The CTR-IN will accelerate the development of capacity and the necessary institutional culture change, to advance this work to the benefit of regional populations.

"Institutional Career Development Core Contact PD/PI: Grandis, Jennifer Rubin Inst-Career-Dev-001 (146) KL2 Abstract The rationale and fundamental goal of the UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute KL2 Scholars Program is to train, mentor and equip succeeding generations of exceptional and diverse junior faculty investigators with the methodologic, analytic, leadership, and team science skills required to conduct transformative clinical and translational research. The Program's alumni, as individuals and as members of multidisciplinary teams, have made exceptional contributions to health sciences research across the lifespan. The proposed career development program is a key resource for clinical departments and research units across the campus, and does not duplicate existing training programs at UCSF. In continuing the successful KL2 program, with core faculty expertise in clinical and methodologic research, multisite studies and trials, and vulnerable populations, the Program provides a proven and vital resource for UCSF faculty from the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Dentistry, and Pharmacy. In the proposed funding period the Program will leverage UCSF's unique strengths and partnerships with basic scientists, biopharmaceutical investigators, and industry innovators to position its Scholars to continue to advance the field of Clinical and Translational Science, with the following proposed Aims: Aim 1. To recruit a superb group of professionally and ethnically diverse UCSF junior faculty KL2 Scholars and to support them for up to 3 years as they progress toward research independence with individual NIH K and R awards; Aim 2. To expand and enhance training and mentoring at the frontiers of clinical and translational research, in partnership with other CTSI programs, emphasizing cutting-edge research methods; Aim 2a. Educate, train, and mentor KL2 Scholars to take full advantage of technology-enabled research methods; Aim 2b. Educate, train, and mentor KL2 Scholars to plan and conduct high-quality, efficient multisite studies and trials, and successfully disseminate and implement study results; Aim 2c. Promote research in traditionally understudied special populations and enhance efforts to address health inequities; Aim 3. Promote multidisciplinary collaboration and team science through leadership training, mentorship and the creation of KL2 Scholar “teamlets” focused on addressing a specific research problem; Aim 4. To share and disseminate the successful elements of the KL2 Program as a model for regional collaboration. The KL2 Scholars Program is designed around in-depth education, systematic in-person activities, bringing together Scholars from widely varied disciplines with senior faculty who facilitate development of their research and professional skills. Program experience demonstrates that a “face-to-face” structure, with a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration, peer mentorship, and team science skills, is essential for the KL2 Scholars to become successful independent clinical and translational investigators.

"Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center ABSTRACT The overall goal the Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC) Translational Workforce Development component is training and development of an interprofessional, interdisciplinary, and ethnically/racially/culturally diverse clinical and translational workforce with skills to meet the health care needs of our community, the region and the nation. The KL2 Mentored Career Development Program (KL2 Program) will engage talented and motivated scholars in any health science discipline (including medicine, nursing, dental, pharmacy, public health) to join the clinical and translational science workforce to develop new diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic interventions for diseases with emphasis on addressing health disparities affecting our communities. We will train scholars to use an interdisciplinary approach to translate basic and clinical advances into improved healthcare. We will develop an ethnic/racial/culturally diverse workforce to overcome the growing divide between clinical and research careers, and to address health inequities in communities such as Buffalo. Buffalo is the 3rd poorest city in the country, where over 50% of its population belongs to traditional underrepresented [(AA (39%), HA (11%), NA/PI (0.8%)] (2010 Census) and/or underserved minorities. Refugees represent over 5% of the Buffalo population. The goal of this KL2 Program is to train at least four junior faculty/physician scientist scholars by supporting them for two years with the expectation that, with training and mentor assistance, they secure an additional three years of individual funding through K awards to complete the five-year training program. The program is complemented by and integrated with an institutionally funded Dean's Scholars program, which allows us to train 6 additional scholars under the same terms. There will be 5 scholars in the program in Years 1 and 2 and 10 thereafter. We will focus on recruiting individuals from underrepresented backgrounds in health science professions. The program has four specific aims: 1) Attract, engage, and train in state-of-the-art clinical and translational science and a broad range of health science disciplines talented and motivated early career investigators who come from underrepresented groups or disadvantaged backgrounds and/or bring new perspectives to health disparities challenges; 2) Develop comprehensive mentoring programs for mentors and trainees tailored to individual needs; 3) Promote pathways to independence by fostering inter-professional and inter-disciplinary training for scholars to master team science concepts; and 4) Empower our Community of Scholars to collaborate and identify new areas of engagement with other CTSA hubs.

"Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science: A Partnership to Improve Health San Antonio, the gateway to South Texas, is the 7**^ largest city in the US and the largest metropolitan area with a majority Hispanic population (63%). South Texas is about the size of Ohio, and comprises an impoverished and largely Hispanic population with disproportionate rates of diabetes and obesity, exacerbated by a lack of health insurance and poor access to health care. This region also contains numerous US military installations, and active-duty service members and veterans often have special health issues, including Increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic injuries. Unfortunately, neither better access to care nor improved care delivery can eliminate health disparities and meet these complex needs, in addition, research across the full T l to T4 translational spectrum is required to eliminate knowledge gaps and establish real-world effectiveness that improves health care for our populations.  In 2006, UTHSCSA established the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science (IIMS) to improve health and reduce disparities by accelerating scientific discoveries and applications across the full translational research spectrum. For example, IIMS expanded the number of clinical research units that extend to the Texas-Mexico border from 1 to 7, and dramatically increasing participant access to clinical and translational science. We increased, from 2 to 6, the Practice-Based Research Networks that focus on diverse ambulatory populations. Efforts to address translational science workforce needs over the past 5-10 years have graduated 100 Masters Clinical Investigation students, supported 19 successful KL2 Scholars, and established new joint Translational Science PhD and Certificate programs. In this proposal, we provide strategies to spur clinical and translational science evolution, catalyze research teams, and implement programs that produce creative, collaborative, and culturally diverse scientists. Our Specific Aims will: 1. Accelerate clinical and translational research innovation and effective team science along the  entire 11 to T4 research spectrum by providing an academic home integrated with our strategic  partner institutions. 2. Expand, diversify, and enhance the workforce of interdisciplinary translational biomedical scientists. 3. Implement effective methods to continuously evaluate and optimize services, increase  efficiencies, improve processes, and reduce costs across all IIMS programs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Based on our vision of improving the health status of South Texas by accelerating scientific discoveries and public health applications, we will deploy strategic resources that focus on prevalent challenges in our region, including: 1) the health needs of our underserved Hispanic population, 2) the special health issues facing active-duty military and veteran populations, and 3) limitations in the translational science workforce required to fill in critical knowledge gaps and improve health in South Texas and the US.

"Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research A. Center Overview Project Abstract  Diabetes mellitus is a significant health burden in the United States, affecting more than 20,000,000 people and costing more than $100 billion annually. The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is growing rapidly; the CDC estimates that up to 1/3 of Americans will have diabetes by the year 2050. The burden of T2DM is particularly great among ethnic minority populations and those of lower socioeconomic status. The evidence base for the prevention and care of T2DM is one of the most well-established of any chronic illness: clinical trials have shown the efficacy of cardiometabolic therapies in preventing mortality and morbidity in diabetes, and programs such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) have demonstrated that diabetes can be prevented in high-risk patients. However, the overall quality of care for diabetes remains sub-optimal, significant disparities in diabetes care and prevention persist, and there are very few effective population- based efforts to systematically reduce prevent diabetes and reduce diabetes risk. Programs that can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-based diabetes prevention and treatment into widespread practice are desperately needed.  In response to this need, diabetes researchers at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, and the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) created the Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research (HDS-CDTR) in 2011 (P30 DK092924). This CDTR fosters and supports translational research in diabetes within health care delivery systems affiliated with the Health Care Systems Research Network (formerly known as the HMO Research Network) and with UCSF. The HDS- CDTR brings together a multi-disciplinary network of well-established investigators with a strong history of receiving federal and foundation funding in diabetes translational research. The HDS-CDTR is structured around three Translational Research Cores in the areas of health care disparities; diabetes and obesity prevention; and health information technology. HDS-CDTR investigators have strong relationships with delivery systems, ranging from large integrated delivery systems to networks of safety net providers that serve as key partners for translating effective interventions into real-world clinical settings. Our CDTR will continue to be a strong resource to under- resourced delivery systems across the U.S. through its Resource Core, which will continue and expand our support of these systems in their efforts to provide high quality diabetes prevention and care. In addition, the HDS-CDTR is expanding its mission to address disparities through the creation of a new Core for Underserved Populations that will develop a strong partnership with junior and senior Underrepresented Minority (URM) investigators at the Morehouse School of Medicine. A. Center Overview Project Narrative The purpose of this renewal application is to continue and expand the work of the Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research, a collaborative partnership between the Kaiser Permanente Northern California's Division of Research, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, and the University of California San Francisco. This Center leverages expertise in three Core Translational Research areas of diabetes prevention, health care disparities, and health IT to facilitate and disseminate high quality diabetes translational research across a range of delivery systems, including safety net and other under-resourced systems through its National Resource Core.

"RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals who suffer from disproportionately high rates of premature morbidity and mortality, including racial and ethnic minorities, those of low socioeconomic status, and rural persons, are considered health disparity populations. ""Translational Research"", a bidirectional process focused on ""translating"" basic scientific discoveries into health interventions, and then into clinical practice to improve patient care and population health, has been proposed as an important approach to reduce health disparities. Connecting these populations to new health advances requires effective health education, engaging more minority participants in clinical trials, producing more minority investigators and enhancing research infrastructure at minority institutions. RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) have been developed to leverage the existing physical and intellectual resources and to promote and support relevant multi-site clinical and translational research focused on reducing health disparities and improving health outcomes. To build upon five years of infrastructure growth, the consortium of NIH-funded Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) has come together to submit for a renewal for the network. RTRN will continue to synergize and coordinate the considerable multidisciplinary talents of basic, clinical and community investigators to gain new knowledge about the social, economic, behavioral, cultural, environmental, perinatal and genetic determinants of health disparities. Based on the success of the first five years and the data arising from the RTRN evaluation, as well as critical input from the RCMI Steering and External Advisory Committees, the following specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: Enhance and streamline overall RTRN management and operations; Specific Aim 2: Engage RCMI investigators and other stakeholders, including the lay community, to strengthen capacity for multi-site clinical and translational research; Specific Aim 3: Enhance the infrastructure for project management, performance monitoring and data analysis; and Specific Aim 4.- Enhance the development and adoption of best practices for disseminating research findings to reduce health disparities and improve disease outcomes.

"Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center Contact PD/PI: Murphy, Timothy F Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes 12 major academic, research and healthcare institutions and 5 influential community partners in our region, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The distribution of underrepresented minorities who experience health disparities in Buffalo in 2015 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 35 years. The vision for our CTSA hub is to develop, test and share novel approaches to improve health and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Improving health in our community and the nation will require innovative research across the full T1 through T4 translational spectrum. In 2012, the University at Buffalo opened the new 170,000 ft2 state-of-the-art Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) devoted entirely to clinical and translational research. The CTRC provides a centralized facility, including translational research laboratories, a clinical research center, an imaging center, a lab animal facility and a biorepository. The CTRC and other enormous BTC investments to build a 21st century Academic Health Center creates a setting for a CTSA to provide the key piece to transform our capacity to bring discoveries in the laboratory, the clinic and the community to benefit individual and public health by sharing expertise and innovative approaches to translational science as part of the national consortium. We will bring strengths to the CTSA consortium, including developing novel health informatics tools, leveraging our strength as a leading center on research in standards and ontologies; new approaches to community-based research developed with our community; testing and disseminating ontology-based methods to share translational image data; and one of the few full service Drug Development Services in the consortium.  With a CTSA we will 1) accelerate the development, implementation and dissemination of new healthcare interventions and their translation into the community through innovative research across the T1 through T4 spectrum, 2) train and develop an excellent and diverse workforce to ensure that translational researchers and their teams have the skills and knowledge to advance translation of discoveries, 3) build a translational science pipeline that integrates data from multiple sources and combines data analysis methods to discover diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive interventions, and 4) streamline clinical research processes with a focus on quality to enhance recruitment of special populations across the lifespan and groups with health disparities, and accelerate multi-site clinical trial initiation. Building on our unique strengths will enhance both our local and national CTSA network capacity through collaboration and sharing expertise and resources.

Building on our existing programs, we propose to (1) provide innovative programs in career development for a wide range of learners, (2) develop new pilot programs to support creation of solutions for obstacles to research, (3) expand our community engagement program to extend beyond Greater Cincinnati to stakeholders across the U.S., (4) provide more comprehensive support by biomedical informatics for the services provided by the CCTST, (5) expand support for patient-oriented research, and (6) help overcome regulatory and ethical challenges that impede clinical research in local and multisite studies. We propose innovative efforts directed toward fostering learning health networks and creating a Research Commons to provide more comprehensive support to investigators. We will focus on (1) teaching and implementing team science principles and encouraging collaboration across a variety of disciplines and stakeholders, (2) consolidation of clinical trials support across the academic health center by creating Cinci-HERO to help multicenter trials for which the CCTST affiliates are the leads (including serving as the IRB of record) or site participants and recruitment of populations across the lifespan including underrepresented minorities, those with environmental exposures and health disparities, and (3) acute care research and lifespan data integration that takes advantage of institutional strengths. The maturation of the CTSA consortium has led to more effective and efficient clinical and translational research across the 62 sites. The University of Cincinnati Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training has already been successful at fostering and become the focal point for clinical and translational research in Cincinnati. With this renewal application, we will develop additional innovative methods to produce high quality research, share these discoveries, and collaborate with other CTSA hubs.",Cincinnati Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences and Training,9127375,UL1TR001425,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Learning ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Multi-center trial ', ' Multicenter Trials ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' Government Officials ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' career development ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Master of Science ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Community Practice ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' practice-based research network ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' data integration ', ' Information Technology ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' Community of Practice ', ' ']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,UL1,2016,3418842,0.25598825875259856

"Mentored postdoctoral training in health disparities and community-partnered part     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed CRECD Program at Charles R. Drew University (CDU), Mentored Postdoctoral Training in Translational Research, is a Phase II mentored clinical research and career development program designed to develop a diverse cadre of clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases, in particular those diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States (e.g., HIV/AIDS, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mental health/psychiatric disorders), and to foster and facilitate professional development activities in clinical and translational sciences. Over the initial 5-year program period, the CRECD Program will accept a total of eight postdoctoral trainees at the junior faculty level at CDU, each for 3-year appointments, staggered in appointment periods. The CRECD Program will be embedded within the existing, extensive clinical research and training infrastructure at CDU, and thus will mutually leverage resources with other CDU research education and career development programs so as to achieve maximal cross-program synergies as well as efficiencies wrought from utilizing already-in-place education and training curricula and related resources germane to the CRECD agenda. However, the CRECD Program will also carve out a unique niche of training and career development opportunities within the broader CDU science-generating ""critical mass"" by (1) focusing exclusively on health disparities and mastery of community-partnered participatory methods in the research and research training agenda and (2) providing to each trainee a first-of-its-kind (at CDU and, by our estimate, nationwide) intensive and community-immersive mentoring configuration that includes CDU faculty from both the standard or conventional Academic Career track and the newly emerging Community Faculty track, called the Partnership for Equity and Equality in Health and Wellness. This intensive mentoring innovation directly emerges from, and formalizes and systematizes into a signature trainee mentoring configuration, a long and fruitful history of community-engaged research, training, and educational curricula at CDU. As an integrated research training and career development package, this approach is designed to bring social determinants of health to the forefront of molecular and clinical research. Ultimately, the goal is to increase the impact of community- academic partnered research and adoption of its evidence-based best practices through comprehensive dissemination of research findings so as to encourage and facilitate implementation of evidence-based treatment and prevention practices within health care organizations and the communities most in need of reliable access to high-quality care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): By providing an outstanding and intensive research mentoring, training, and career development opportunity to minority and other underrepresented postdoctoral scholars in the translational sciences, this new program at Charles Drew University will increase the diversity of the scientific workforce and develop next-generation clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases, in particular those diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States.            ",Mentored postdoctoral training in health disparities and community-partnered part,9061435,R25MD007610,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Adoption ', ' Appointment ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' career track ', ' career pathway ', ' career interest ', ' career aspiration ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Industry ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Private Sector ', ' Public Sector ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Scholarship ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' Science ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Training and Education ', ' health care organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' career development ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' dissemination research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' social health determinants ', ' faculty community ', ' education research ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,CHARLES R.

"Mississippi Center for Clinical and Translational Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is associated with heightened risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers, as well as increased all-cause mortality. Mississippi consistently ranks among the states with the highest rates of obesity, particularly among African Americans. The University of Mississippi Medical Center has a history of success in basic research, including obesity research, and observational studies, but historically has not been strong in clinical or translational research. This application describes a proposed ""Mississippi Center for Clinical and Translational Research"" (CCTR), which will be a partnership involving UMMC, the University of Southern Mississippi, and Tougaloo College, a historically black college/university. The CCTR will also pursue extensive collaboration with the IDeA-funded Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science Center, and Mayo Clinic's Center for Clinical and Translational Science. An Administrative Core with clear lines of authority and responsibility will be responsible for managing and coordinating the full range of CCTR activities. It will monitor progress toward project goals and milestones, and will have a flexible and responsible leadership and advisory structure that will allow it to realign resources to maximize the beneficial effects of the CCTR. A Community Advisory Board will provide bi-directional communication and guidance on community values, concerns, and needs, and will represent the CCTR to Mississippi communities. A Professional Development Core will offer structured mentorship, protected time for research, and substantial funding for obesity-focused research to junior faculty of all CCTR partners, and will offer training and support for community engaged research to develop the next generation of obesity investigators in Mississippi and increase the diversity of the research workforce. A Clinical Research, Epidemiology, and Biostatistics Core will provide extensive training and assistance with research design and implementation, data collection and management, data analysis, biostatistics, and epidemiology to increase the effectiveness, efficiency, and success of clinical and translational obesity research by CCTR faculty members. A Pilot Projects Program will support research projects that are likely to lead to extramural funding and sustained research success, and to improve obesity, related disorders, and health disparities. A Research Service Center will provide ethics consultation and extensive training and assistance with regulatory and administrative management and research implementation. A Tracking and Evaluation Core will provide extensive, accurate, and timely information on CCTR performance and impact to inform project planning and implementation by CCTR leadership and advisory bodies.

"Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center Contact PD/PI: Murphy, Timothy F Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes 12 major academic, research and healthcare institutions and 5 influential community partners in our region, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The distribution of underrepresented minorities who experience health disparities in Buffalo in 2015 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 35 years. The vision for our CTSA hub is to develop, test and share novel approaches to improve health and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Improving health in our community and the nation will require innovative research across the full T1 through T4 translational spectrum. In 2012, the University at Buffalo opened the new 170,000 ft2 state-of-the-art Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) devoted entirely to clinical and translational research. The CTRC provides a centralized facility, including translational research laboratories, a clinical research center, an imaging center, a lab animal facility and a biorepository. The CTRC and other enormous BTC investments to build a 21st century Academic Health Center creates a setting for a CTSA to provide the key piece to transform our capacity to bring discoveries in the laboratory, the clinic and the community to benefit individual and public health by sharing expertise and innovative approaches to translational science as part of the national consortium. We will bring strengths to the CTSA consortium, including developing novel health informatics tools, leveraging our strength as a leading center on research in standards and ontologies; new approaches to community-based research developed with our community; testing and disseminating ontology-based methods to share translational image data; and one of the few full service Drug Development Services in the consortium.  With a CTSA we will 1) accelerate the development, implementation and dissemination of new healthcare interventions and their translation into the community through innovative research across the T1 through T4 spectrum, 2) train and develop an excellent and diverse workforce to ensure that translational researchers and their teams have the skills and knowledge to advance translation of discoveries, 3) build a translational science pipeline that integrates data from multiple sources and combines data analysis methods to discover diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive interventions, and 4) streamline clinical research processes with a focus on quality to enhance recruitment of special populations across the lifespan and groups with health disparities, and accelerate multi-site clinical trial initiation. Building on our unique strengths will enhance both our local and national CTSA network capacity through collaboration and sharing expertise and resources.

"Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network IDeA-CTR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is compelling need for a Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network (CTR-IN) to serve the seven Western Region IDeA states (AK HI, ID, MT, NM NV and WY) our states cover 1/3 of the US and mass yet currently contribute little to clinical and translational science. The CTR-IN will provide infrastructure and centralized services in support of institutions that for the most part have successful programs in basic science, but little or no tradition or capacity in clinical or translational research. Eleven of the 13 partners in this proposal have minimal resources to support faculty in this work. The other two With CTSA and RCMI support are relatively small but eager to help the others. Our mission is to increase the quantity, quality, and competitive, peer-reviewed support for clinical and translational research across these 7 states thereby accelerating the translation and application of scientific discovery improve health in our region and elsewhere. Academic institutions in this region share common challenges in building these research capabilities in under-resourced environments that are geographically large and rural. With ethnically diverse populations many of which are impoverished with poor access to care, including vulnerable subgroups with significant health disparities. We will provide education mentoring, study design. bio statistical and study design support. and a variety of opportunities (pilot grants, mini-sabbaticals and visiting scholarships} for exposure to levels of science and clinical research environments that are simply not available to faculty at their home institutions An essential element of our proposal is a robust internet presence that will provide the asynchronous access to Information and services essential in our area which spans 4 time zones. Our network will also support high bandwidth synchronous communication for video conferencing, seminars and similar unifying events that will efficiently bring state-of-the-art science and resources w isolated partners. To accomplish our mission, we will partner with the University of New Mexico CTSC and the RCMI program at the University of Hawaii to extend their expertise and leverage their resources across the region. We will also leverage resources with the RCMI Translational Science Network (RTRN). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The 7 Western Region IDeA states lack adequate infrastructure and expertise to conduct clinical and translational research addressing regional health issues affecting our remote, culturally diverse, underserved populations.

"Hispanic Clinical and Translational Research Education and Career Development (HCTRECD) Program The Hispanic Clinical and Translational Research Education and Career Development (HCTRECD) program at the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus (UPR-MSC) has a documented track record of increasing diversity in clinical and translational research by supporting research career development of Hispanics since 2002. Our program consists of formal research training (Phase I) through an established institutionally supported post-doctoral Master of Science in Clinical and Translational Research (MSc). We have already enrolled 89 health professionals from multiple disciplines, including medicine, occupational therapy, audiology, dental medicine, nursing, pharmacy and psychology, among others. These scholars have become leaders in clinical and translational research and health disparities and have produced 150 peer revie wed publications and 62 grant submissions on topics that disproportionately affect Hispanics. The most qualified graduates from Phase I compete to receive additional support for advanced clinical research experiences through Phase II. We have been successful in supporting 10 phase II scholars who have moved on to become independent clinical researchers. In addition, our program has contributed new knowledge on how to recruit and train professionals from underrepresented groups through active leadership in national programs and a productive publication record. The research that has been supported by the HCTRECD has added important knowledge to relevant areas of health disparities research among Hispanics including cancer, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, infant/maternal health, and mental health. The purpose of this renewal application is to develop and implement innovations that will strengthen our program. These enhancements will lead to more Hispanics entering the clinical and translational research workforce and t o new knowledge on how to reduce health disparities. Our proposed improvements are based on what we have learned from our 14-year trajectory training Hispanic clinical researchers. The overall goal of the HCTRECD program is to increase the number of Hispanics performing clinical and translational research while also increasing the knowledge on the causes and interventions that can help reduce health disparities. In order to continue pursuing this goal, we will now achieve the following specific aims: 1) Enhance the didactic program by providing our scholars with individualized training on advanced research tracks such as precision medicine, patient centered methodologies, population health and clinical trials and 2) Enrich the mentored research experiences to address the individual clinical and translational research skills needs of our scholars.

"RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals who suffer from disproportionately high rates of premature morbidity and mortality, including racial and ethnic minorities, those of low socioeconomic status, and rural persons, are considered health disparity populations. ""Translational Research"", a bidirectional process focused on ""translating"" basic scientific discoveries into health interventions, and then into clinical practice to improve patient care and population health, has been proposed as an important approach to reduce health disparities. Connecting these populations to new health advances requires effective health education, engaging more minority participants in clinical trials, producing more minority investigators and enhancing research infrastructure at minority institutions. RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) have been developed to leverage the existing physical and intellectual resources and to promote and support relevant multi-site clinical and translational research focused on reducing health disparities and improving health outcomes. To build upon five years of infrastructure growth, the consortium of NIH-funded Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) has come together to submit for a renewal for the network. RTRN will continue to synergize and coordinate the considerable multidisciplinary talents of basic, clinical and community investigators to gain new knowledge about the social, economic, behavioral, cultural, environmental, perinatal and genetic determinants of health disparities. Based on the success of the first five years and the data arising from the RTRN evaluation, as well as critical input from the RCMI Steering and External Advisory Committees, the following specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: Enhance and streamline overall RTRN management and operations; Specific Aim 2: Engage RCMI investigators and other stakeholders, including the lay community, to strengthen capacity for multi-site clinical and translational research; Specific Aim 3: Enhance the infrastructure for project management, performance monitoring and data analysis; and Specific Aim 4.- Enhance the development and adoption of best practices for disseminating research findings to reduce health disparities and improve disease outcomes. By leveraging the research infrastructure and resources across RCMI grantee institutions, these four specific  aims will contribute to the overall goal of RTRN, which is to accelerate the quality and pace of transformative  research on diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnically diverse, low income, geographically  remote, and/or medically underserved populations.",RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN),9505472,U54MD008149,"['Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genetic determinant ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Minority ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' minority institution ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' population health ', ' operation ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' minority investigator ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial minority ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Talents ', ' Translating ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' ']",NIMHD,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2017,2333333,0.1566078693431621
"UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) Contact PD/PI: Kimberly, Robert P The vision of the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) Hub is to reduce health disparities in diseases disproportionately represented within the Deep South as we accelerate discovery to improve human health. We have established a robust Partner Network – spanning Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana – to ensure that our research and training efforts serve the special populations in our region while maximizing collaborative synergies in translational research (Aim 1). We promote the continued development of a diverse, multidisciplinary research workforce representing all career stages, by supporting a broad portfolio of NRSA training, mentored career development, content specific educational programs and experiential learning opportunities (Aim 2). These initiatives deepen scientific understanding of clinical and translational science, establish core competencies and advance the knowledge base in good clinical practice, study design, bioethics, conduct of clinical trials and team science. The CCTS supports ethical, scientifically rigorous clinical trials and pilot research across the CCTS Partner Network (Aim 3) through focused efforts to provide resources, specialized services and consultation in genomics, informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, clinical research, advanced imaging and drug discovery. The CCTS fosters the application of best practices, including those established by the CTSA Consortium, and will promote tools that enable the rapid and efficient execution of multi-site clinical trials, taking advantage of the electronic health record to inform feasibility and access to study populations. Importantly, in keeping with our goal of reducing regional health disparities, we recognize the importance of engaging our communities in the planning and conduct of research (Aim 4). Through our community engagement arm – One Great Community – we are expanding programmatic outreach by taking successful community-based participatory research approaches to a regional scale. Finally, we understand the importance of evaluating the activities of the CCTS Partner Network to ensure that we are accomplishing our goals (Aim 5). Didactic programs, community engagement and research processes are evaluated by a panel of tailored and common metrics to guide strategies and outline progress towards achieving defined goals. By achieving these aims, the CCTS Partner Network will accelerate clinical and translational research in the Deep South and advance the amelioration the significant health disparities faced by our populations.

"Cincinnati Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences and Training The vision of the Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training (CCTST) at the University of Cincinnati is to be the Greater Cincinnati portal of entry for support of clinical and translational research with a goal to enfranchise stakeholders from a broad base to integrate research into healthcare delivery, improve community wellness, foster effective, efficient multisite trials, and train the clinical and translational research workforce of the future. We will realize this vision through three aims: (1) Empower stakeholders in the process of integrating research with healthcare practice and community wellness, (2) Create the workforce of the future, and (3) Optimize efficiency and effectiveness of clinical research. Building on the successes of the last 6 years, we propose innovative changes to existing programs and creation of new programs designed to provide support for high quality cutting-edge research done by teams of scientists. Building on our existing programs, we propose to (1) provide innovative programs in career development for a wide range of learners, (2) develop new pilot programs to support creation of solutions for obstacles to research, (3) expand our community engagement program to extend beyond Greater Cincinnati to stakeholders across the U.S., (4) provide more comprehensive support by biomedical informatics for the services provided by the CCTST, (5) expand support for patient-oriented research, and (6) help overcome regulatory and ethical challenges that impede clinical research in local and multisite studies. We propose innovative efforts directed toward fostering learning health networks and creating a Research Commons to provide more comprehensive support to investigators. We will focus on (1) teaching and implementing team science principles and encouraging collaboration across a variety of disciplines and stakeholders, (2) consolidation of clinical trials support across the academic health center by creating Cinci-HERO to help multicenter trials for which the CCTST affiliates are the leads (including serving as the IRB of record) or site participants and recruitment of populations across the lifespan including underrepresented minorities, those with environmental exposures and health disparities, and (3) acute care research and lifespan data integration that takes advantage of institutional strengths.

"Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science: A Partnership to Improve Health San Antonio, the gateway to South Texas, is the 7*^ largest city in the US and the largest metropolitan area with a majority Hispanic population (63%). South Texas is about the size of Ohio, and comprises an impoverished and largely Hispanic population with disproportionate rates of diabetes and obesity, exacerbated by a lack of health insurance and poor access to health care. This region also contains numerous US military installations, and active-duty service members and veterans often have special health issues, including Increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic injuries. Unfortunately, neither better access to care nor improved care delivery can eliminate health disparities and meet these complex needs, in addition, research across the full T l to T4 translational spectrum is required to eliminate knowledge gaps and establish real-world effectiveness that improves health care for our populations.  In 2006, UTHSCSA established the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science (IIMS) to improve health and reduce disparities by accelerating scientific discoveries and applications across the full translational research spectrum. For example, IIMS expanded the number of clinical research units that extend to the Texas-Mexico border from 1 to 7, and dramatically increasing participant access to clinical and translational science. We increased, from 2 to 6, the Practice-Based Research Networks that focus on diverse ambulatory populations. Efforts to address translational science workforce needs over the past 5-10 years have graduated 100 Masters Clinical Investigation students, supported 19 successful KL2 Scholars, and established new joint Translational Science PhD and Certificate programs. In this proposal, we provide strategies to spur clinical and translational science evolution, catalyze research teams, and implement programs that produce creative, collaborative, and culturally diverse scientists. Our Specific Aims will: 1. Accelerate clinical and translational research innovation and effective team science along the  entire 11 to T4 research spectrum by providing an academic home integrated with our strategic  partner institutions. 2. Expand, diversify, and enhance the workforce of interdisciplinary translational biomedical scientists. 3.

"Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research A. Center Overview Project Abstract  Diabetes mellitus is a significant health burden in the United States, affecting more than 20,000,000 people and costing more than $100 billion annually. The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is growing rapidly; the CDC estimates that up to 1/3 of Americans will have diabetes by the year 2050. The burden of T2DM is particularly great among ethnic minority populations and those of lower socioeconomic status. The evidence base for the prevention and care of T2DM is one of the most well-established of any chronic illness: clinical trials have shown the efficacy of cardiometabolic therapies in preventing mortality and morbidity in diabetes, and programs such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) have demonstrated that diabetes can be prevented in high-risk patients. However, the overall quality of care for diabetes remains sub-optimal, significant disparities in diabetes care and prevention persist, and there are very few effective population- based efforts to systematically reduce prevent diabetes and reduce diabetes risk. Programs that can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-based diabetes prevention and treatment into widespread practice are desperately needed.  In response to this need, diabetes researchers at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, and the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) created the Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research (HDS-CDTR) in 2011 (P30 DK092924). This CDTR fosters and supports translational research in diabetes within health care delivery systems affiliated with the Health Care Systems Research Network (formerly known as the HMO Research Network) and with UCSF. The HDS- CDTR brings together a multi-disciplinary network of well-established investigators with a strong history of receiving federal and foundation funding in diabetes translational research. The HDS-CDTR is structured around three Translational Research Cores in the areas of health care disparities; diabetes and obesity prevention; and health information technology. HDS-CDTR investigators have strong relationships with delivery systems, ranging from large integrated delivery systems to networks of safety net providers that serve as key partners for translating effective interventions into real-world clinical settings. Our CDTR will continue to be a strong resource to under- resourced delivery systems across the U.S. through its Resource Core, which will continue and expand our support of these systems in their efforts to provide high quality diabetes prevention and care. In addition, the HDS-CDTR is expanding its mission to address disparities through the creation of a new Core for Underserved Populations that will develop a strong partnership with junior and senior Underrepresented Minority (URM) investigators at the Morehouse School of Medicine. A. Center Overview Project Narrative The purpose of this renewal application is to continue and expand the work of the Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research, a collaborative partnership between the Kaiser Permanente Northern California's Division of Research, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, and the University of California San Francisco. This Center leverages expertise in three Core Translational Research areas of diabetes prevention, health care disparities, and health IT to facilitate and disseminate high quality diabetes translational research across a range of delivery systems, including safety net and other under-resourced systems through its National Resource Core.

"Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center Contact PD/PI: Murphy, Timothy F Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes 12 major academic, research and healthcare institutions and 5 influential community partners in our region, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The distribution of underrepresented minorities who experience health disparities in Buffalo in 2015 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 35 years. The vision for our CTSA hub is to develop, test and share novel approaches to improve health and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Improving health in our community and the nation will require innovative research across the full T1 through T4 translational spectrum. In 2012, the University at Buffalo opened the new 170,000 ft2 state-of-the-art Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) devoted entirely to clinical and translational research. The CTRC provides a centralized facility, including translational research laboratories, a clinical research center, an imaging center, a lab animal facility and a biorepository. The CTRC and other enormous BTC investments to build a 21st century Academic Health Center creates a setting for a CTSA to provide the key piece to transform our capacity to bring discoveries in the laboratory, the clinic and the community to benefit individual and public health by sharing expertise and innovative approaches to translational science as part of the national consortium. We will bring strengths to the CTSA consortium, including developing novel health informatics tools, leveraging our strength as a leading center on research in standards and ontologies; new approaches to community-based research developed with our community; testing and disseminating ontology-based methods to share translational image data; and one of the few full service Drug Development Services in the consortium.  With a CTSA we will 1) accelerate the development, implementation and dissemination of new healthcare interventions and their translation into the community through innovative research across the T1 through T4 spectrum, 2) train and develop an excellent and diverse workforce to ensure that translational researchers and their teams have the skills and knowledge to advance translation of discoveries, 3) build a translational science pipeline that integrates data from multiple sources and combines data analysis methods to discover diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive interventions, and 4) streamline clinical research processes with a focus on quality to enhance recruitment of special populations across the lifespan and groups with health disparities, and accelerate multi-site clinical trial initiation. Building on our unique strengths will enhance both our local and national CTSA network capacity through collaboration and sharing expertise and resources.

"Institutional Clinical AND Translational Science Award Overall Project Summary: The University of Wisconsin (UW) Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) was created in 2007 against a backdrop of institutional change at UW during which the UW Medical School pivoted to become a School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH, 2005) and the other Health Sciences Schools retooled their missions to encompass health maintenance, preventative care, and improvements in health-delivery systems. Since its inception, ICTR succeeded in changing the culture of research at UW and at Marshfield Clinic (MC) and became recognized as the academic and administrative home for clinical and translational science. This section outlines the most notable ICTR accomplishments leading to transformative changes in the broad areas of administration, education of the translational workforce, and expansion of the research infrastructure. Many of the administrative successes were aligned with development of mutually- beneficial, collaborative relationships including the foundational UW and MC partnership, establishment of multi-site research networks, cross-CTSA program development, braided federal and local funding for ICTR programs and pilot awards, and affiliation with other UW centers and programs with overlapping missions. Translational workforce development included creating vigorous TL1 and KL2 training programs, establishing graduate degree and certificate programs in Clinical Investigation, and offering diverse non-degree options for learners at multiple levels and tracks. Additional collaborative efforts led to a nationally recognized program in research mentor training and the Health Equity Leadership Institute, a career development experience for investigators engaged in health disparities/health equity research. The central fact illustrating the expansion of the UW research infrastructure is that ICTR resources and services supported ~2,500 unique investigators, who have pursued 3,824 research projects. ICTR has provided pilot funding across the T0-T4 translational spectrum including awards specific to pediatric, geriatric, and minority populations. Consultations and other expert services span biostatistics, bioinformatics, laboratory services, and an array of clinical and regulatory services. Finally, the ICTR community engagement program is recognized as a national model for how to create partnerships with community stakeholders and organizations (431 to date) and now includes dissemination and implementation programs. Significantly, this section also provides examples of how ICTR- supported research programs have already impacted health care and health in Wisconsin and nationally. In the next grant cycle, ICTR will continue to address translational workforce development with an emphasis on team science and competency-based training, and community engagement in research with novel strategies for implementation of health advances and involvement of patient advocates. Additionally, the research infrastructure will be continuously improved through cycles of quality improvement and innovation and informatics methods for translational research will be introduced. Special populations research will be integrated across the T0-T4 spectrum and across the lifespan. Project Summary/Abstract Page 126 Contact PD/PI: DREZNER, MARC K  Overall - CTSA As a member of the NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards program since 2007, the mission of the University of Wisconsin (UW) Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) is to improve public health by translating basic research discoveries into direct, practical improvements in clinical care and health care delivery systems. Current ICTR-supported research programs have already directly impacted community health in Wisconsin and nationally.

"West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute: Improving Health through Partnerships and Transformative Research Mortality rates in Appalachia have progressively increased over recent years, in contrast to decreasing mortality rates observed in the remainder of the US. West Virginia was ranked 47th overall among the 50 states in the 2015 America's Health Rankings. In addition, WV remains at, or near, the bottom for a number of chronic diseases including cancer and cardiovascular disease. These observations alone do not capture the entire continuum of health related challenges in the state or region, but clearly emphasize the need for continued focus on, and investment in, research that underpins real solutions. The West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI) was created in 2012 through the initial Clinical and Translational Research (CTR) award and has subsequently formed a well-connected, statewide research network, creating the infrastructure to address the substantial health disparities that exist in West Virginia. The overarching goal of the WVCTSI is to serve as a collaborative hub to lead statewide innovation in clinical and translational research, catalyzing and accelerating development of solutions to vexing health problems. Over the past four years, WVCTSI has been a transformative force, implementing investigator mentoring services, establishing pilot project funding, forming a practice-based research network of 68 sites (mostly rural), creating an integrated data repository of two million unique electronic medical records, developing a broad-based culture of research integrity, and working with our partners to establish trust and effective collaboration. WVCTSI is now well positioned to attain the goals of this renewal application that include: 1) building sustainable research infrastructure that substantively contributes to improving WV health outcomes by 2022, 2) recruiting the next generation of clinician scientists and translational researchers that excel in team science and are positioned for long-term success, and 3) actively engaging with multiple stakeholders that include communities, medical providers, and policy makers to drive research that improves health of West Virginians. Our partners include all academic medical centers within the state as well as the University of Kentucky, the Veterans Administration, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

"CDU-CRECD Mentored Postdoctoral Training in Translational Research and Biomedical Informatics Program PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed CDU-CRECD Mentored Postdoctoral Training in Translational Research and Biomedical Informatics Program at Charles R. Drew University (CDU) is a mentored clinical research and career development program designed to develop a diverse cadre of clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States (e.g., cancer, drug use and addiction, and mental health/psychiatric disorders), and to foster and facilitate professional development activities in clinical and translational sciences. Over the proposed 5-year program period, the CDU-CRECD Program will accept a total of 12 minority postdoctoral trainees at the junior faculty level at CDU. Phase I is comprised of two years of structured mentoring and support for earning a Master of Public Health (MPH) in Urban Health Disparities with a dual focus on the fields of Biomedical Informatics and Community Participatory Clinical Translational Research. Phase II is comprised of a clinical/translational research project to continue working toward establishing their own independent research program as clinical research scientists leading to applications for individual mentored career development (K) or research grant (R series) awards. The CRECD Program will be embedded within the existing, extensive clinical research and training infrastructure at CDU, and thus will mutually leverage resources with other CDU research education and career development programs so as to achieve maximal cross-program synergies as well as efficiencies from utilizing already-in-place education and training curricula and related resources germane to the CRECD agenda. The CRECD Program will also carve out a unique niche of training and career development opportunities within the broader CDU science- generating “critical mass” by (1) focusing exclusively on urban health disparities and mastery of biomedical informatics and community-partnered participatory methods in the research and research training agenda and (2) providing to each trainee an intensive and community-immersive mentoring configuration that includes CDU faculty from both the conventional Academic Career track and the Community Faculty track. This intensive mentoring innovation directly emerges from, and formalizes and systematizes into a signature trainee mentoring configuration, a long and fruitful history of community-engaged research, training, and educational curricula at CDU. As an integrated research training and career development package, this approach is designed to bring social determinants of health to the forefront of molecular and clinical research. Ultimately, the goal is to increase the impact of community-academic partnered research through comprehensive dissemination of research findings so as to encourage and facilitate implementation of evidence-based treatment and prevention practices within health care organizations and the communities most in need of reliable access to high-quality care. PROJECT NARRATIVE By providing underrepresented junior faculty and postdoctoral scholars the opportunity to earn a Master of Public Health (MPH) in Urban Health Disparities with a dual focus on the fields of Biomedical Informatics and Community Based Participatory Research, followed by intensive research mentoring, training, and career development, this renewal of the CRECD Program at Charles R.

"Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science: A Partnership to Improve Health San Antonio, the gateway to South Texas, is the 7""^ largest city in the US and the largest metropolitan area with a majority Hispanic population (63%). South Texas is about the size of Ohio, and comprises an impoverished and largely Hispanic population with disproportionate rates of diabetes and obesity, exacerbated by a lack of health insurance and poor access to health care. This region also contains numerous US military installations, and active-duty service members and veterans often have special health issues, including increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic injuries. Unfortunately, neither better access to care nor improved care delivery can eliminate health disparities and meet these complex needs. In addition, research across the full T l to T4 translational spectrum is required to eliminate knowledge gaps and establish real-world effectiveness that improves health cai^e for our populations.  In 2006, UTHSCSA established the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science (IIMS) to improve health and reduce disparities by accelerating scientific discoveries and applications across the full translational research spectrum. For example, IIMS expanded the number of clinical research units that extend to the Texas-Mexico border from 1 to 7, and dramatically increasing participant access to clinical and translational science. We increased, from 2 to 6, the Practice-Based Research Networks that focus on diverse ambulatory populations. Efforts to address translational science workforce needs over the past 5-10 years have graduated 100 Masters Clinical Investigation students, supported 19 successful KL2 Scholars, and established new joint Translational Science PhD and Certificate programs. In this proposal, we provide strategies to spur clinical and translational science evolution, catalyze research teams, and implement programs that produce creative, collaborative, and culturally diverse scientists. Our Specific Aims will: 1. Accelerate clinical and translational research innovation and effective team science along the  entire T1 to 14 research spectrum by providing an academic home integrated with our strategic  partner institutions. 2.

"Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center Contact PD/PI: Murphy, Timothy F Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes 12 major academic, research and healthcare institutions and 5 influential community partners in our region, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The distribution of underrepresented minorities who experience health disparities in Buffalo in 2015 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 35 years. The vision for our CTSA hub is to develop, test and share novel approaches to improve health and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Improving health in our community and the nation will require innovative research across the full T1 through T4 translational spectrum. In 2012, the University at Buffalo opened the new 170,000 ft2 state-of-the-art Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) devoted entirely to clinical and translational research. The CTRC provides a centralized facility, including translational research laboratories, a clinical research center, an imaging center, a lab animal facility and a biorepository. The CTRC and other enormous BTC investments to build a 21st century Academic Health Center creates a setting for a CTSA to provide the key piece to transform our capacity to bring discoveries in the laboratory, the clinic and the community to benefit individual and public health by sharing expertise and innovative approaches to translational science as part of the national consortium. We will bring strengths to the CTSA consortium, including developing novel health informatics tools, leveraging our strength as a leading center on research in standards and ontologies; new approaches to community-based research developed with our community; testing and disseminating ontology-based methods to share translational image data; and one of the few full service Drug Development Services in the consortium.  With a CTSA we will 1) accelerate the development, implementation and dissemination of new healthcare interventions and their translation into the community through innovative research across the T1 through T4 spectrum, 2) train and develop an excellent and diverse workforce to ensure that translational researchers and their teams have the skills and knowledge to advance translation of discoveries, 3) build a translational science pipeline that integrates data from multiple sources and combines data analysis methods to discover diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive interventions, and 4) streamline clinical research processes with a focus on quality to enhance recruitment of special populations across the lifespan and groups with health disparities, and accelerate multi-site clinical trial initiation. Building on our unique strengths will enhance both our local and national CTSA network capacity through collaboration and sharing expertise and resources.

"Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network IDeA-CTR MW CTR-IN Program -- Abstract  The diverse Mountain West (MW) population continues to be plagued by high rates of health disparities (HD) and lower life expectancy rates when compared to the rest of the US1. The MW Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network (CTR-IN) was established in 2013. During the last 4 years, we have created an impactful and transformative research network with our 13 MW university partners located geographically among 7 Institutional Development Award (IDeA) states to address the health disparities affecting the MW population in Year 6-10. Yet, despite this huge territory and an overall insufficient regional clinical research infrastructure, we have successfully created and implemented a highly functional CTR-IN program in the last 4 years that has seeded a transformative culture of CTR among the 13 MW universities. Over the last 4 years, we created and implemented 4 highly productive Cores consisting of Pilot Grants, Biostatistics, Professional Development and Administration that have positioned us to focus on addressing the health disparities in our MW region for the next 5 years.  Hence, we propose to expand the original mission of the MW CTR-IN Program by further enhancing the research infrastructure in the 7 MW IDeA states for the conduct of rigorous clinical and translational research (CTR) focused on health disparities. The 3 major themes of our proposal are as follows: (1) CTR focused on the MW health disparities; (2) Priority on the professional development of the MW junior faculty investigators; and (3) Providing leadership to the other IDeA programs & Universities in the MW region. Hence, we are proposing 4 major aims to focus our activities on the health disparities in the MW region through rigorous CTR as follows: Aim 1. Enhance the infrastructure and human resources required to conduct rigorous CTR in our 7 IDeA MW states at our 13 major public university partners. Aim 2. Focus on the health disparities experienced by our diverse populations such as the medically underserved and/or rural communities in our 7 IDeA MW states through our CTR programs. Aim 3. Enhance the ability of our IDeA universities and investigators to develop competitive clinical and translational research grants for subsequent extramural funding. Aim 4. Foster increased collaboration and coordination of clinical and translational activities within and across our 7 MW IDeA states and our 13 MW university partners. Overall -- Project Narrative In our 7 Mountain West (MW) IDeA states, health disparities are a major health crisis. During the past four years, the MW CTR-IN program has established a research infrastructure working in conjunction with our 13 MW University partners located geographically among our 7 IDeA states. The MW CTR-IN program plans to expand the original mission of the CTR-IN program by further enhancing the research infrastructure of the MW region for the conduct of rigorous clinical and translational research to focus on health disparities in years 6-10.",Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network IDeA-CTR,9574864,U54GM104944,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Rest ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Rural Community ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' programs ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Stretching ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Coordination and Collaboration ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' medically underserved ', ' operation ', ' Core Grant ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' translational research program ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS,U54,2018,4286271,0.1874873944271167

"Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center Contact PD/PI: Murphy, Timothy F Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes 12 major academic, research and healthcare institutions and 5 influential community partners in our region, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The distribution of underrepresented minorities who experience health disparities in Buffalo in 2015 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 35 years. The vision for our CTSA hub is to develop, test and share novel approaches to improve health and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Improving health in our community and the nation will require innovative research across the full T1 through T4 translational spectrum. In 2012, the University at Buffalo opened the new 170,000 ft2 state-of-the-art Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) devoted entirely to clinical and translational research. The CTRC provides a centralized facility, including translational research laboratories, a clinical research center, an imaging center, a lab animal facility and a biorepository. The CTRC and other enormous BTC investments to build a 21st century Academic Health Center creates a setting for a CTSA to provide the key piece to transform our capacity to bring discoveries in the laboratory, the clinic and the community to benefit individual and public health by sharing expertise and innovative approaches to translational science as part of the national consortium. We will bring strengths to the CTSA consortium, including developing novel health informatics tools, leveraging our strength as a leading center on research in standards and ontologies; new approaches to community-based research developed with our community; testing and disseminating ontology-based methods to share translational image data; and one of the few full service Drug Development Services in the consortium.  With a CTSA we will 1) accelerate the development, implementation and dissemination of new healthcare interventions and their translation into the community through innovative research across the T1 through T4 spectrum, 2) train and develop an excellent and diverse workforce to ensure that translational researchers and their teams have the skills and knowledge to advance translation of discoveries, 3) build a translational science pipeline that integrates data from multiple sources and combines data analysis methods to discover diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive interventions, and 4) streamline clinical research processes with a focus on quality to enhance recruitment of special populations across the lifespan and groups with health disparities, and accelerate multi-site clinical trial initiation. Building on our unique strengths will enhance both our local and national CTSA network capacity through collaboration and sharing expertise and resources.

"Institutional Clinical AND Translational Science Award Overall Project Summary: The University of Wisconsin (UW) Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) was created in 2007 against a backdrop of institutional change at UW during which the UW Medical School pivoted to become a School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH, 2005) and the other Health Sciences Schools retooled their missions to encompass health maintenance, preventative care, and improvements in health-delivery systems. Since its inception, ICTR succeeded in changing the culture of research at UW and at Marshfield Clinic (MC) and became recognized as the academic and administrative home for clinical and translational science. This section outlines the most notable ICTR accomplishments leading to transformative changes in the broad areas of administration, education of the translational workforce, and expansion of the research infrastructure. Many of the administrative successes were aligned with development of mutually- beneficial, collaborative relationships including the foundational UW and MC partnership, establishment of multi-site research networks, cross-CTSA program development, braided federal and local funding for ICTR programs and pilot awards, and affiliation with other UW centers and programs with overlapping missions. Translational workforce development included creating vigorous TL1 and KL2 training programs, establishing graduate degree and certificate programs in Clinical Investigation, and offering diverse non-degree options for learners at multiple levels and tracks. Additional collaborative efforts led to a nationally recognized program in research mentor training and the Health Equity Leadership Institute, a career development experience for investigators engaged in health disparities/health equity research. The central fact illustrating the expansion of the UW research infrastructure is that ICTR resources and services supported ~2,500 unique investigators, who have pursued 3,824 research projects. ICTR has provided pilot funding across the T0-T4 translational spectrum including awards specific to pediatric, geriatric, and minority populations. Consultations and other expert services span biostatistics, bioinformatics, laboratory services, and an array of clinical and regulatory services. Finally, the ICTR community engagement program is recognized as a national model for how to create partnerships with community stakeholders and organizations (431 to date) and now includes dissemination and implementation programs. Significantly, this section also provides examples of how ICTR- supported research programs have already impacted health care and health in Wisconsin and nationally. In the next grant cycle, ICTR will continue to address translational workforce development with an emphasis on team science and competency-based training, and community engagement in research with novel strategies for implementation of health advances and involvement of patient advocates. Additionally, the research infrastructure will be continuously improved through cycles of quality improvement and innovation and informatics methods for translational research will be introduced. Special populations research will be integrated across the T0-T4 spectrum and across the lifespan.

"West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute: Improving Health through Partnerships and Transformative Research Mortality rates in Appalachia have progressively increased over recent years, in contrast to decreasing mortality rates observed in the remainder of the US. West Virginia was ranked 47th overall among the 50 states in the 2015 America's Health Rankings. In addition, WV remains at, or near, the bottom for a number of chronic diseases including cancer and cardiovascular disease. These observations alone do not capture the entire continuum of health related challenges in the state or region, but clearly emphasize the need for continued focus on, and investment in, research that underpins real solutions. The West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI) was created in 2012 through the initial Clinical and Translational Research (CTR) award and has subsequently formed a well-connected, statewide research network, creating the infrastructure to address the substantial health disparities that exist in West Virginia. The overarching goal of the WVCTSI is to serve as a collaborative hub to lead statewide innovation in clinical and translational research, catalyzing and accelerating development of solutions to vexing health problems. Over the past four years, WVCTSI has been a transformative force, implementing investigator mentoring services, establishing pilot project funding, forming a practice-based research network of 68 sites (mostly rural), creating an integrated data repository of two million unique electronic medical records, developing a broad-based culture of research integrity, and working with our partners to establish trust and effective collaboration. WVCTSI is now well positioned to attain the goals of this renewal application that include: 1) building sustainable research infrastructure that substantively contributes to improving WV health outcomes by 2022, 2) recruiting the next generation of clinician scientists and translational researchers that excel in team science and are positioned for long-term success, and 3) actively engaging with multiple stakeholders that include communities, medical providers, and policy makers to drive research that improves health of West Virginians. Our partners include all academic medical centers within the state as well as the University of Kentucky, the Veterans Administration, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Through its collective activities and powerful partnerships, the WVCTSI will play a critical role in reversing the trend of increasing mortality rates in West Virginia and serve as a model for developing effective research infrastructure that provides solutions to regional health issues.

"RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals who suffer from disproportionately high rates of premature morbidity and mortality, including racial and ethnic minorities, those of low socioeconomic status, and rural persons, are considered health disparity populations. ""Translational Research"", a bidirectional process focused on ""translating"" basic scientific discoveries into health interventions, and then into clinical practice to improve patient care and population health, has been proposed as an important approach to reduce health disparities. Connecting these populations to new health advances requires effective health education, engaging more minority participants in clinical trials, producing more minority investigators and enhancing research infrastructure at minority institutions. RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) have been developed to leverage the existing physical and intellectual resources and to promote and support relevant multi-site clinical and translational research focused on reducing health disparities and improving health outcomes. To build upon five years of infrastructure growth, the consortium of NIH-funded Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) has come together to submit for a renewal for the network. RTRN will continue to synergize and coordinate the considerable multidisciplinary talents of basic, clinical and community investigators to gain new knowledge about the social, economic, behavioral, cultural, environmental, perinatal and genetic determinants of health disparities. Based on the success of the first five years and the data arising from the RTRN evaluation, as well as critical input from the RCMI Steering and External Advisory Committees, the following specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: Enhance and streamline overall RTRN management and operations; Specific Aim 2: Engage RCMI investigators and other stakeholders, including the lay community, to strengthen capacity for multi-site clinical and translational research; Specific Aim 3: Enhance the infrastructure for project management, performance monitoring and data analysis; and Specific Aim 4.- Enhance the development and adoption of best practices for disseminating research findings to reduce health disparities and improve disease outcomes. By leveraging the research infrastructure and resources across RCMI grantee institutions, these four specific  aims will contribute to the overall goal of RTRN, which is to accelerate the quality and pace of transformative  research on diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnically diverse, low income, geographically  remote, and/or medically underserved populations.",RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN),9667721,U54MD008149,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Talents ', ' Translating ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genetic determinant ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Minority ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' minority institution ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' population health ', ' operation ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' minority investigator ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NIMHD,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2018,1000000,0.1566078693431621
"West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute: Improving Health through Partnerships and Transformative Research Mortality rates in Appalachia have progressively increased over recent years, in contrast to decreasing mortality rates observed in the remainder of the US. West Virginia was ranked 47th overall among the 50 states in the 2015 America's Health Rankings. In addition, WV remains at, or near, the bottom for a number of chronic diseases including cancer and cardiovascular disease. These observations alone do not capture the entire continuum of health related challenges in the state or region, but clearly emphasize the need for continued focus on, and investment in, research that underpins real solutions. The West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI) was created in 2012 through the initial Clinical and Translational Research (CTR) award and has subsequently formed a well-connected, statewide research network, creating the infrastructure to address the substantial health disparities that exist in West Virginia. The overarching goal of the WVCTSI is to serve as a collaborative hub to lead statewide innovation in clinical and translational research, catalyzing and accelerating development of solutions to vexing health problems. Over the past four years, WVCTSI has been a transformative force, implementing investigator mentoring services, establishing pilot project funding, forming a practice-based research network of 68 sites (mostly rural), creating an integrated data repository of two million unique electronic medical records, developing a broad-based culture of research integrity, and working with our partners to establish trust and effective collaboration. WVCTSI is now well positioned to attain the goals of this renewal application that include: 1) building sustainable research infrastructure that substantively contributes to improving WV health outcomes by 2022, 2) recruiting the next generation of clinician scientists and translational researchers that excel in team science and are positioned for long-term success, and 3) actively engaging with multiple stakeholders that include communities, medical providers, and policy makers to drive research that improves health of West Virginians. Our partners include all academic medical centers within the state as well as the University of Kentucky, the Veterans Administration, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Through its collective activities and powerful partnerships, the WVCTSI will play a critical role in reversing the trend of increasing mortality rates in West Virginia and serve as a model for developing effective research infrastructure that provides solutions to regional health issues.

"CDU-CRECD Mentored Postdoctoral Training in Translational Research and Biomedical Informatics Program PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed CDU-CRECD Mentored Postdoctoral Training in Translational Research and Biomedical Informatics Program at Charles R. Drew University (CDU) is a mentored clinical research and career development program designed to develop a diverse cadre of clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States (e.g., cancer, drug use and addiction, and mental health/psychiatric disorders), and to foster and facilitate professional development activities in clinical and translational sciences. Over the proposed 5-year program period, the CDU-CRECD Program will accept a total of 12 minority postdoctoral trainees at the junior faculty level at CDU. Phase I is comprised of two years of structured mentoring and support for earning a Master of Public Health (MPH) in Urban Health Disparities with a dual focus on the fields of Biomedical Informatics and Community Participatory Clinical Translational Research. Phase II is comprised of a clinical/translational research project to continue working toward establishing their own independent research program as clinical research scientists leading to applications for individual mentored career development (K) or research grant (R series) awards. The CRECD Program will be embedded within the existing, extensive clinical research and training infrastructure at CDU, and thus will mutually leverage resources with other CDU research education and career development programs so as to achieve maximal cross-program synergies as well as efficiencies from utilizing already-in-place education and training curricula and related resources germane to the CRECD agenda. The CRECD Program will also carve out a unique niche of training and career development opportunities within the broader CDU science- generating “critical mass” by (1) focusing exclusively on urban health disparities and mastery of biomedical informatics and community-partnered participatory methods in the research and research training agenda and (2) providing to each trainee an intensive and community-immersive mentoring configuration that includes CDU faculty from both the conventional Academic Career track and the Community Faculty track. This intensive mentoring innovation directly emerges from, and formalizes and systematizes into a signature trainee mentoring configuration, a long and fruitful history of community-engaged research, training, and educational curricula at CDU. As an integrated research training and career development package, this approach is designed to bring social determinants of health to the forefront of molecular and clinical research. Ultimately, the goal is to increase the impact of community-academic partnered research through comprehensive dissemination of research findings so as to encourage and facilitate implementation of evidence-based treatment and prevention practices within health care organizations and the communities most in need of reliable access to high-quality care. PROJECT NARRATIVE By providing underrepresented junior faculty and postdoctoral scholars the opportunity to earn a Master of Public Health (MPH) in Urban Health Disparities with a dual focus on the fields of Biomedical Informatics and Community Based Participatory Research, followed by intensive research mentoring, training, and career development, this renewal of the CRECD Program at Charles R.

"Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research A. Center Overview Project Abstract  Diabetes mellitus is a significant health burden in the United States, affecting more than 20,000,000 people and costing more than $100 billion annually. The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is growing rapidly; the CDC estimates that up to 1/3 of Americans will have diabetes by the year 2050. The burden of T2DM is particularly great among ethnic minority populations and those of lower socioeconomic status. The evidence base for the prevention and care of T2DM is one of the most well-established of any chronic illness: clinical trials have shown the efficacy of cardiometabolic therapies in preventing mortality and morbidity in diabetes, and programs such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) have demonstrated that diabetes can be prevented in high-risk patients. However, the overall quality of care for diabetes remains sub-optimal, significant disparities in diabetes care and prevention persist, and there are very few effective population- based efforts to systematically reduce prevent diabetes and reduce diabetes risk. Programs that can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-based diabetes prevention and treatment into widespread practice are desperately needed.  In response to this need, diabetes researchers at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, and the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) created the Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research (HDS-CDTR) in 2011 (P30 DK092924). This CDTR fosters and supports translational research in diabetes within health care delivery systems affiliated with the Health Care Systems Research Network (formerly known as the HMO Research Network) and with UCSF. The HDS- CDTR brings together a multi-disciplinary network of well-established investigators with a strong history of receiving federal and foundation funding in diabetes translational research. The HDS-CDTR is structured around three Translational Research Cores in the areas of health care disparities; diabetes and obesity prevention; and health information technology. HDS-CDTR investigators have strong relationships with delivery systems, ranging from large integrated delivery systems to networks of safety net providers that serve as key partners for translating effective interventions into real-world clinical settings. Our CDTR will continue to be a strong resource to under- resourced delivery systems across the U.S. through its Resource Core, which will continue and expand our support of these systems in their efforts to provide high quality diabetes prevention and care. In addition, the HDS-CDTR is expanding its mission to address disparities through the creation of a new Core for Underserved Populations that will develop a strong partnership with junior and senior Underrepresented Minority (URM) investigators at the Morehouse School of Medicine. A. Center Overview Project Narrative The purpose of this renewal application is to continue and expand the work of the Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research, a collaborative partnership between the Kaiser Permanente Northern California's Division of Research, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, and the University of California San Francisco. This Center leverages expertise in three Core Translational Research areas of diabetes prevention, health care disparities, and health IT to facilitate and disseminate high quality diabetes translational research across a range of delivery systems, including safety net and other under-resourced systems through its National Resource Core.

"UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) Contact PD/PI: Kimberly, Robert P The vision of the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) Hub is to reduce health disparities in diseases disproportionately represented within the Deep South as we accelerate discovery to improve human health. We have established a robust Partner Network – spanning Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana – to ensure that our research and training efforts serve the special populations in our region while maximizing collaborative synergies in translational research (Aim 1). We promote the continued development of a diverse, multidisciplinary research workforce representing all career stages, by supporting a broad portfolio of NRSA training, mentored career development, content specific educational programs and experiential learning opportunities (Aim 2). These initiatives deepen scientific understanding of clinical and translational science, establish core competencies and advance the knowledge base in good clinical practice, study design, bioethics, conduct of clinical trials and team science. The CCTS supports ethical, scientifically rigorous clinical trials and pilot research across the CCTS Partner Network (Aim 3) through focused efforts to provide resources, specialized services and consultation in genomics, informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, clinical research, advanced imaging and drug discovery. The CCTS fosters the application of best practices, including those established by the CTSA Consortium, and will promote tools that enable the rapid and efficient execution of multi-site clinical trials, taking advantage of the electronic health record to inform feasibility and access to study populations. Importantly, in keeping with our goal of reducing regional health disparities, we recognize the importance of engaging our communities in the planning and conduct of research (Aim 4). Through our community engagement arm – One Great Community – we are expanding programmatic outreach by taking successful community-based participatory research approaches to a regional scale. Finally, we understand the importance of evaluating the activities of the CCTS Partner Network to ensure that we are accomplishing our goals (Aim 5). Didactic programs, community engagement and research processes are evaluated by a panel of tailored and common metrics to guide strategies and outline progress towards achieving defined goals. By achieving these aims, the CCTS Partner Network will accelerate clinical and translational research in the Deep South and advance the amelioration the significant health disparities faced by our populations. Further, the CCTS Hub and its Partner Network will be well-positioned to work with other hubs and the CTSA Consortium in the dissemination of best practices in clinical and translational research and training.

"Hispanic Clinical and Translational Research Education and Career Development (HCTRECD) Program The Hispanic Clinical and Translational Research Education and Career Development (HCTRECD) program at the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus (UPR-MSC) has a documented track record of increasing diversity in clinical and translational research by supporting research career development of Hispanics since 2002. Our program consists of formal research training (Phase I) through an established institutionally supported post-doctoral Master of Science in Clinical and Translational Research (MSc). We have already enrolled 89 health professionals from multiple disciplines, including medicine, occupational therapy, audiology, dental medicine, nursing, pharmacy and psychology, among others. These scholars have become leaders in clinical and translational research and health disparities and have produced 150 peer revie wed publications and 62 grant submissions on topics that disproportionately affect Hispanics. The most qualified graduates from Phase I compete to receive additional support for advanced clinical research experiences through Phase II. We have been successful in supporting 10 phase II scholars who have moved on to become independent clinical researchers. In addition, our program has contributed new knowledge on how to recruit and train professionals from underrepresented groups through active leadership in national programs and a productive publication record. The research that has been supported by the HCTRECD has added important knowledge to relevant areas of health disparities research among Hispanics including cancer, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, infant/maternal health, and mental health. The purpose of this renewal application is to develop and implement innovations that will strengthen our program. These enhancements will lead to more Hispanics entering the clinical and translational research workforce and t o new knowledge on how to reduce health disparities. Our proposed improvements are based on what we have learned from our 14-year trajectory training Hispanic clinical researchers. The overall goal of the HCTRECD program is to increase the number of Hispanics performing clinical and translational research while also increasing the knowledge on the causes and interventions that can help reduce health disparities. In order to continue pursuing this goal, we will now achieve the following specific aims: 1) Enhance the didactic program by providing our scholars with individualized training on advanced research tracks such as precision medicine, patient centered methodologies, population health and clinical trials and 2) Enrich the mentored research experiences to address the individual clinical and translational research skills needs of our scholars.

"Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science: A Partnership to Improve Health Contact PD/PI: Clark, Robert A. Overall-Abstract San Antonio, positioned at the gateway to South Texas, is the 7th largest US city and the largest metropolitan area with a minority-majority population. Our 38-county region comprises an impoverished, rural, and largely Hispanic population with disproportionate rates of diabetes, obesity, and cancer, exacerbated by lack of health insurance and poor access to care. The region is home to major US military facilities, including the world's largest military medical complex. Service members and veterans form populations with special needs. Neither better access to care nor improved care delivery, on their own, can eliminate health disparities. Innovative translational research is required to fill knowledge gaps and establish real-world effectiveness to improve health. In 2006, UT Health Science Center-San Antonio established the Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science (IIMS) as the academic home for our growing translational science initiatives, training the translational science workforce, formalizing key strategic partnerships, and creating a community of scholars within a learning healthcare system. We expanded clinical research programs, dramatically increasing access to clinical trials. We developed 6 Practice-Based Research Networks that focus on diverse ambulatory populations. We created 6 county-wide Translational Advisory Boards that support engagement through priority setting and matching with academic investigators. IIMS pioneered IRB process harmonization, resulting in rapid review times and streamlined pathways to multisite study initiation. We operate a robust pilot grant program, leveraged among our partners, with a remarkable return on investment. Our workforce development programs, with matriculants reflecting our diverse population, have graduated 133 masters degree students, supported 27 successful KL2 Scholars and 16 TL1 Scholars, and established de novo a Translational Science PhD program. Our informatics team has led electronic health record data warehouse development, fostering matches between IIMS investigators and practice-relevant research priorities. IIMS is now poised to deploy our robust portfolio of programs across our growing, leveraged, and innovative network of institutional and community partners. In this proposal, we provide clear strategies to support clinical and translational science across partner organizations, catalyze research team success, and implement programs that produce creative, collaborative, and culturally diverse translational scientists. IIMS seeks exceptionalism in translating scientific discoveries across the T1 to T4 spectrum into improved health care outcomes. Our over-arching Specific Aims are:  1. Accelerate clinical and translational research innovation and team science along the entire T1 to T4  research spectrum by providing an academic home integrated with our strategic partner institutions  2. Expand, diversify, and enhance the workforce of interdisciplinary translational biomedical scientists  3. Implement effective methods to continuously evaluate and optimize services, increase efficiencies,  improve processes, endorse common metrics, and reduce costs across all IIMS programs Project Summary/Abstract Page 237 Contact PD/PI: Clark, Robert A.

"Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center ABSTRACT The overall goal the Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC) Translational Workforce Development component is training and development of an interprofessional, interdisciplinary, and ethnically/racially/culturally diverse clinical and translational workforce with skills to meet the health care needs of our community, the region and the nation. The KL2 Mentored Career Development Program (KL2 Program) will engage talented and motivated scholars in any health science discipline (including medicine, nursing, dental, pharmacy, public health) to join the clinical and translational science workforce to develop new diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic interventions for diseases with emphasis on addressing health disparities affecting our communities. We will train scholars to use an interdisciplinary approach to translate basic and clinical advances into improved healthcare. We will develop an ethnic/racial/culturally diverse workforce to overcome the growing divide between clinical and research careers, and to address health inequities in communities such as Buffalo. Buffalo is the 3rd poorest city in the country, where over 50% of its population belongs to traditional underrepresented [(AA (39%), HA (11%), NA/PI (0.8%)] (2010 Census) and/or underserved minorities. Refugees represent over 5% of the Buffalo population. The goal of this KL2 Program is to train at least four junior faculty/physician scientist scholars by supporting them for two years with the expectation that, with training and mentor assistance, they secure an additional three years of individual funding through K awards to complete the five-year training program. The program is complemented by and integrated with an institutionally funded Dean's Scholars program, which allows us to train 6 additional scholars under the same terms. There will be 5 scholars in the program in Years 1 and 2 and 10 thereafter. We will focus on recruiting individuals from underrepresented backgrounds in health science professions. The program has four specific aims: 1) Attract, engage, and train in state-of-the-art clinical and translational science and a broad range of health science disciplines talented and motivated early career investigators who come from underrepresented groups or disadvantaged backgrounds and/or bring new perspectives to health disparities challenges; 2) Develop comprehensive mentoring programs for mentors and trainees tailored to individual needs; 3) Promote pathways to independence by fostering inter-professional and inter-disciplinary training for scholars to master team science concepts; and 4) Empower our Community of Scholars to collaborate and identify new areas of engagement with other CTSA hubs. The program will train and develop KL2 Scholars' professional skills and facilitate a seamless transition to their next career level within the clinical and translational workforce pipeline. KL2 Scholars, as leaders of the CTSA Community of Scholars, will have the opportunity to give back by providing mentoring and guidance in the discipline to students and peers from our community, the region, and nationwide through the CTSA consortium.

"Center for Clinical and Translational Science ABSTRACT − OVERALL. The vision of the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) is to reduce health disparities in diseases disproportionately represented within the Deep South as we accelerate discovery to improve human health. We have established a robust Partner Network – spanning Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana – to ensure that our research and training efforts serve the special populations in our region while maximizing collaborative synergies in translational research to advance fundamental and clinical discovery through to application to human health and healthcare delivery. The CCTS will further the development of a vibrant, diverse clinical and translational research workforce (Aim 1) by providing education and training programs for learners at all career stages in support of innovative, multidisciplinary, engaged team research. We will continue to create and apply novel approaches in gamification, experiential learning, mentoring, and team-focused design thinking in I-Corps™ to convey new skills, perspectives and understanding of the translation process. We will catalyze collaborative, coordinated data analytics and informatics across the Partner Network and the CTSA consortium (Aim 2) by extending the digitally integrated ecosystem enabling full utilization of high dimensional data together with rich, deep clinical information to enable discovery research from the bench to the learning healthcare system. In keeping with our goal of reducing regional health disparities, we will expand the involvement of our communities in trusting, productive relationships and broadly engaged teams that advance knowledge to impactful implementation (Aim 3). We will work closely with local constituencies to address health issues of particular significance to our region and will share best practices in pursuit of community engaged studies to enhance culturally sensitive participation, safety, confidentiality and effectiveness. Toward the rapid and efficient translation of rigorously designed and effectively implemented clinical studies and trials (Aim 4), the CCTS Partner Network will support the ethical conduct of scientifically rigorous pilot and clinical research by providing a range of specialized services, resources and consultations. This effort will develop and will leverage innovative processes established by the CTSA Consortium and will promote the use of collaborative tools and processes that enable the rapid and efficient execution of multi-site clinical trials, taking advantage of the electronic health record to inform feasibility and access to study populations. Finally, we understand the importance of evaluating the CCTS activities to assure efficiency, quality and sustainability (Aim 5). We will use quantitative and qualitative assessment and feedback to assure that training and research programs meet the needs of its scientific constituencies and the goals of the CCTS, consistent with consortium-wide Common Metrics and Results Based Accountability evaluation activities. By achieving these aims, the CCTS Partner Network will accelerate clinical and translational research in the Deep South and advance the amelioration the significant health disparities faced by our populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE.

"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined. Project Narrative The New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS), as a member of the CTSA Consortium, unites Rutgers University, Princeton University, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, clinical, community and industry partners in a shared vision to make New Jersey a healthier state. Building on New Jersey’s already significant capabilities to promote and facilitate clinical and translational research, NJ ACTS will serve as a catalyst, inspiring new approaches to diagnose and manage disease, and fostering career development of the next generation of translational researchers, and promoting population health.",New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ

"Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science: A Partnership to Improve Health Contact PD/PI: Clark, Robert A. Overall-Abstract San Antonio, positioned at the gateway to South Texas, is the 7th largest US city and the largest metropolitan area with a minority-majority population. Our 38-county region comprises an impoverished, rural, and largely Hispanic population with disproportionate rates of diabetes, obesity, and cancer, exacerbated by lack of health insurance and poor access to care. The region is home to major US military facilities, including the world's largest military medical complex. Service members and veterans form populations with special needs. Neither better access to care nor improved care delivery, on their own, can eliminate health disparities. Innovative translational research is required to fill knowledge gaps and establish real-world effectiveness to improve health. In 2006, UT Health Science Center-San Antonio established the Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science (IIMS) as the academic home for our growing translational science initiatives, training the translational science workforce, formalizing key strategic partnerships, and creating a community of scholars within a learning healthcare system. We expanded clinical research programs, dramatically increasing access to clinical trials. We developed 6 Practice-Based Research Networks that focus on diverse ambulatory populations. We created 6 county-wide Translational Advisory Boards that support engagement through priority setting and matching with academic investigators. IIMS pioneered IRB process harmonization, resulting in rapid review times and streamlined pathways to multisite study initiation. We operate a robust pilot grant program, leveraged among our partners, with a remarkable return on investment. Our workforce development programs, with matriculants reflecting our diverse population, have graduated 133 masters degree students, supported 27 successful KL2 Scholars and 16 TL1 Scholars, and established de novo a Translational Science PhD program. Our informatics team has led electronic health record data warehouse development, fostering matches between IIMS investigators and practice-relevant research priorities. IIMS is now poised to deploy our robust portfolio of programs across our growing, leveraged, and innovative network of institutional and community partners. In this proposal, we provide clear strategies to support clinical and translational science across partner organizations, catalyze research team success, and implement programs that produce creative, collaborative, and culturally diverse translational scientists. IIMS seeks exceptionalism in translating scientific discoveries across the T1 to T4 spectrum into improved health care outcomes. Our over-arching Specific Aims are:  1. Accelerate clinical and translational research innovation and team science along the entire T1 to T4  research spectrum by providing an academic home integrated with our strategic partner institutions  2. Expand, diversify, and enhance the workforce of interdisciplinary translational biomedical scientists  3. Implement effective methods to continuously evaluate and optimize services, increase efficiencies,  improve processes, endorse common metrics, and reduce costs across all IIMS programs Project Summary/Abstract Page 237 Contact PD/PI: Clark, Robert A. PROJECT NARRATIVE The vision of the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science is to improve health and reduce disparities by accelerating scientific discoveries and applications across the full translational research spectrum. We will accomplish this by strategic resource deployment, focusing on prevalent challenges in our region, including: 1) the health needs of our underserved Hispanic and rural populations, 2) the special health issues facing active- duty military and veteran populations, and 3) limitations in the translational science workforce required to fill in critical knowledge gaps and improve health in South Texas and the US.

"Institutional Clinical AND Translational Science Award Overall Project Summary: The University of Wisconsin (UW) Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) was created in 2007 against a backdrop of institutional change at UW during which the UW Medical School pivoted to become a School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH, 2005) and the other Health Sciences Schools retooled their missions to encompass health maintenance, preventative care, and improvements in health-delivery systems. Since its inception, ICTR succeeded in changing the culture of research at UW and at Marshfield Clinic (MC) and became recognized as the academic and administrative home for clinical and translational science. This section outlines the most notable ICTR accomplishments leading to transformative changes in the broad areas of administration, education of the translational workforce, and expansion of the research infrastructure. Many of the administrative successes were aligned with development of mutually- beneficial, collaborative relationships including the foundational UW and MC partnership, establishment of multi-site research networks, cross-CTSA program development, braided federal and local funding for ICTR programs and pilot awards, and affiliation with other UW centers and programs with overlapping missions. Translational workforce development included creating vigorous TL1 and KL2 training programs, establishing graduate degree and certificate programs in Clinical Investigation, and offering diverse non-degree options for learners at multiple levels and tracks. Additional collaborative efforts led to a nationally recognized program in research mentor training and the Health Equity Leadership Institute, a career development experience for investigators engaged in health disparities/health equity research. The central fact illustrating the expansion of the UW research infrastructure is that ICTR resources and services supported ~2,500 unique investigators, who have pursued 3,824 research projects. ICTR has provided pilot funding across the T0-T4 translational spectrum including awards specific to pediatric, geriatric, and minority populations. Consultations and other expert services span biostatistics, bioinformatics, laboratory services, and an array of clinical and regulatory services. Finally, the ICTR community engagement program is recognized as a national model for how to create partnerships with community stakeholders and organizations (431 to date) and now includes dissemination and implementation programs. Significantly, this section also provides examples of how ICTR- supported research programs have already impacted health care and health in Wisconsin and nationally. In the next grant cycle, ICTR will continue to address translational workforce development with an emphasis on team science and competency-based training, and community engagement in research with novel strategies for implementation of health advances and involvement of patient advocates. Additionally, the research infrastructure will be continuously improved through cycles of quality improvement and innovation and informatics methods for translational research will be introduced. Special populations research will be integrated across the T0-T4 spectrum and across the lifespan.

"Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science: A Partnership to Improve Health Contact PD/PI: Clark, Robert A. Overall-Abstract San Antonio, positioned at the gateway to South Texas, is the 7th largest US city and the largest metropolitan area with a minority-majority population. Our 38-county region comprises an impoverished, rural, and largely Hispanic population with disproportionate rates of diabetes, obesity, and cancer, exacerbated by lack of health insurance and poor access to care. The region is home to major US military facilities, including the world's largest military medical complex. Service members and veterans form populations with special needs. Neither better access to care nor improved care delivery, on their own, can eliminate health disparities. Innovative translational research is required to fill knowledge gaps and establish real-world effectiveness to improve health. In 2006, UT Health Science Center-San Antonio established the Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science (IIMS) as the academic home for our growing translational science initiatives, training the translational science workforce, formalizing key strategic partnerships, and creating a community of scholars within a learning healthcare system. We expanded clinical research programs, dramatically increasing access to clinical trials. We developed 6 Practice-Based Research Networks that focus on diverse ambulatory populations. We created 6 county-wide Translational Advisory Boards that support engagement through priority setting and matching with academic investigators. IIMS pioneered IRB process harmonization, resulting in rapid review times and streamlined pathways to multisite study initiation. We operate a robust pilot grant program, leveraged among our partners, with a remarkable return on investment. Our workforce development programs, with matriculants reflecting our diverse population, have graduated 133 masters degree students, supported 27 successful KL2 Scholars and 16 TL1 Scholars, and established de novo a Translational Science PhD program. Our informatics team has led electronic health record data warehouse development, fostering matches between IIMS investigators and practice-relevant research priorities. IIMS is now poised to deploy our robust portfolio of programs across our growing, leveraged, and innovative network of institutional and community partners. In this proposal, we provide clear strategies to support clinical and translational science across partner organizations, catalyze research team success, and implement programs that produce creative, collaborative, and culturally diverse translational scientists. IIMS seeks exceptionalism in translating scientific discoveries across the T1 to T4 spectrum into improved health care outcomes. Our over-arching Specific Aims are:  1. Accelerate clinical and translational research innovation and team science along the entire T1 to T4  research spectrum by providing an academic home integrated with our strategic partner institutions  2. Expand, diversify, and enhance the workforce of interdisciplinary translational biomedical scientists  3. Implement effective methods to continuously evaluate and optimize services, increase efficiencies,  improve processes, endorse common metrics, and reduce costs across all IIMS programs Project Summary/Abstract Page 237 Contact PD/PI: Clark, Robert A. PROJECT NARRATIVE The vision of the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science is to improve health and reduce disparities by accelerating scientific discoveries and applications across the full translational research spectrum. We will accomplish this by strategic resource deployment, focusing on prevalent challenges in our region, including: 1) the health needs of our underserved Hispanic and rural populations, 2) the special health issues facing active- duty military and veteran populations, and 3) limitations in the translational science workforce required to fill in critical knowledge gaps and improve health in South Texas and the US.

"Clinical and Translational Science Collaborative of Cleveland Clinical and translational (C/T) research is essential to bring the discoveries of biomedical science to benefit the health and well-being of our nation. The Clinical and Translational Science Collaborative (CTSC) of Cleveland, a collaborative among Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and its affiliated hospital systems, the Cleveland Clinic (CC), MetroHealth (MH), University Hospitals (UH), and the Louis Stokes Veterans Administration Medical Center (VA), aspires to be a catalyst for high quality C/T research both locally and nationally. The CTSC operates as a fully integrated cooperative, collaborative, and confluent research environment that supports all aspects of clinical and translational science, enabling full access by university faculty at all partner institutions to all CTSC-associated potential collaborators and research resources. It has positioned itself to assume leadership in disseminating best practices and promoting multi-site clinical research. It now seeks funding to support the development of program support required to advance the goals set forth by the 2013 recommendations for the CTSA Program by the IOM (now NAM). The CTSC of Cleveland has created a solid foundation on which to build from, to utilize the power of this collaborative to ensure rigorous and innovative training of the C/T/ workforce, to accelerate the translation of discoveries to patients, to improve the health of Cleveland, and to provide scalable models for other locations throughout the nation. To realize its vision, the CTSC of Cleveland proposes to engage all C/T science stakeholders, the workforce, patients and community members to collaborate locally, regionally, and nationally, to 1) advance human health, 2) develop and cultivate the current and next generation C/T research workforce, with special focus on preparation for team science and increasing the diversity of the workforce, 3) promote integration of our translational processes from discovery through clinical trials, of our community throughout the research enterprise, and of special and underserved populations into C/T research across the lifespan, 4) increase the quality and efficiency of C/T research, particularly multi-site trials, through innovative methods and processes and strong collaboration among CTSC Hubs, and 5) provide innovative informatics to support the training and research environment both within the CTSC and nationally. The CTSC has designed an Administrative Core, six C/T research components: Informatics, Community and Collaboration, Translational Endeavors, Research Methods, Hub Research Capacity, and Network Capacity; and two formal C/T training cores: Institutional Career Development Core (KL2), and the NRSA Training Core (TL1) to accomplish its goals. Commitment to collaboration and innovation in C/T research remain top priorities as the CTSC implements its aims and builds the new iteration of the Clinical and Translational Science Collaborative of Cleveland. The Clinical and Translational Science Collaborative (CTSC) of Cleveland has created a solid foundation to support its commitment to improve human health through the special expertise and population that Case Western Reserve University and its four partner hospital systems contribute to support clinical research and training in translational science.

"Institutional Career Development Core The objective of the Institutional Career Development Core (KL2), known locally as the Johns Hopkins Clinical Research Scholars Program, is to develop and support junior faculty from within the Johns Hopkins University and University of Maryland Baltimore Schools of Medicine, Public Health, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Engineering to become independent, ethical, innovative, and transformative clinical and translational research leaders. Scholars gain broad knowledge of the translational research pathway, acquire the skills to adapt and enhance translational research models, and are able to work creatively and collaboratively within multidisciplinary team environments to advance and generate new knowledge to improve human health. Fundamental program elements include advanced didactic coursework, practical training in conducting research, completion of a grant writing course, exposure to innovative research approaches and technology, “hands on” mentored research experience, and comprehensive career development activities designed to create an environment that encourages an interdisciplinary approach and maximizes the probability of successful careers in clinical and translational research. All Scholars will learn the basics about biodesign methods, “big data” approaches, academic entrepreneurship, and health disparities. The KL2 program will support nine junior faculty Scholars for 2 years, followed by an assurance of an additional year of support by the nominating divisions. The new program will merge the existing strengths within the Johns Hopkins Schools of Medicine, Public Health, Nursing, and Engineering, as well as the Johns Hopkins Health System with the expertise at our new ICTR partner at the University of Maryland Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Dentistry, Social Work, and Law, as well as the University of Maryland Medical Center. Integration of these programs will lead to trainee-centered, multidisciplinary learning and enhance junior faculty access to advanced training, especially those from disciplines without a history of formally trained clinical researchers; maximize possibilities for the widest possible cross-fertilization among disciplines; create core resources that facilitate top-notch research by junior faculty who may otherwise lack the resources to hire adequate analytic, statistical, and technical support; and heighten the impact of the approach on the culture of the institution. The intended outcome of the KL2 program is to develop and train the next generation of researchers, who are equipped with a foundation of skills in clinical and translational research, who will successfully transition to career development programs, e.g. K08 or K23 mentored clinician scientist awards, and ultimately to an independent career in clinical and translational research.

"Accelerating Excellence in Translational Science (AXIS) Abstract: Proposed Program Overview. The Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science proposes to continue the enhancement and success of the Accelerating Excellence in Translational Science (AXIS) Center. AXIS has shown to be the integrated hub for research conducted at CDU and continues to provide experienced leadership, and a myriad of clinical, translational, and community partnered activities. In the next five years, research will continue to grow and expand its enterprise alongside the Universities vision and mission to be a leader in eliminating health disparities by translating scientific discoveries into education, training, clinical care, treatment, and community service in three areas of focus which disproportionally affect Service Planning Area 6: Cancer, Cardiometabolic Disease (CMD), and HIV/AIDS. In addition, we look to build upon the application of Precision Medicine to understand and eliminate health disparities, while utilizing many of CDU’s outstanding resources in: Advanced Technologies such as Next Generation Sequencing for identifying Genomic Data; Drug Discovery; Integrated Clinical Tissues, Biorepository and Bio banking Facility; Clinical Studies/Trials Resources; Medical Bioinformatics; and Methods for Statistical and Epidemiological Studies. This approach will pave the pathway for CDU’s in becoming a competitive institution with sophisticated resources and services to better serve our communities. To accomplish this, we propose to continue with the three programmatic goals that align with the mission, vision, and strategic plan for the universities research enterprise: Goal 1: To enhance the infrastructure capacity in translational research using Precision Medicine model in the areas of Cancer, Cardiometabolic, and HIV/AIDS. Provide support for the emerging research pillars in Mental Health and Health Services Goal 2: To continue the integration of basic, clinical, behavioral and community-partnered research by fostering collaboration among disciplines, departments and schools at CDU, and sustainable collaboration with community leaders and investigators across other research institutions. Goal 3: To facilitate and elevate professional development and best practices in mentored clinical and translational research training on minority health and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The predominant ethnic and racial demographics of residents in South Los Angeles, Service Planning Area 6 is Hispanic/Latino (68%) and African American (27%). These communities reside in one of the most underserved and under-resourced location, where access to health care and socio- economic standards are lower than any other county in Los Angeles and in the US. As a result, these communities are more often diagnosed with chronic conditions associated with Obesity, Diabetes, Hypertension, Infectious Diseases, and Mental Health. The incidence, morbidity and mortality rates are highest from Cancer, Cardiovascular Diseases, and Infectious Diseases. Our proposed study will focus on understanding how these socio-economic and environmental factors impact cellular, molecular, genetic, and epigenetic drivers that cause poor health outcomes in our communities.

"Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research A. Center Overview Project Abstract  Diabetes mellitus is a significant health burden in the United States, affecting more than 20,000,000 people and costing more than $100 billion annually. The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is growing rapidly; the CDC estimates that up to 1/3 of Americans will have diabetes by the year 2050. The burden of T2DM is particularly great among ethnic minority populations and those of lower socioeconomic status. The evidence base for the prevention and care of T2DM is one of the most well-established of any chronic illness: clinical trials have shown the efficacy of cardiometabolic therapies in preventing mortality and morbidity in diabetes, and programs such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) have demonstrated that diabetes can be prevented in high-risk patients. However, the overall quality of care for diabetes remains sub-optimal, significant disparities in diabetes care and prevention persist, and there are very few effective population- based efforts to systematically reduce prevent diabetes and reduce diabetes risk. Programs that can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-based diabetes prevention and treatment into widespread practice are desperately needed.  In response to this need, diabetes researchers at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, and the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) created the Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research (HDS-CDTR) in 2011 (P30 DK092924). This CDTR fosters and supports translational research in diabetes within health care delivery systems affiliated with the Health Care Systems Research Network (formerly known as the HMO Research Network) and with UCSF. The HDS- CDTR brings together a multi-disciplinary network of well-established investigators with a strong history of receiving federal and foundation funding in diabetes translational research. The HDS-CDTR is structured around three Translational Research Cores in the areas of health care disparities; diabetes and obesity prevention; and health information technology. HDS-CDTR investigators have strong relationships with delivery systems, ranging from large integrated delivery systems to networks of safety net providers that serve as key partners for translating effective interventions into real-world clinical settings. Our CDTR will continue to be a strong resource to under- resourced delivery systems across the U.S. through its Resource Core, which will continue and expand our support of these systems in their efforts to provide high quality diabetes prevention and care. In addition, the HDS-CDTR is expanding its mission to address disparities through the creation of a new Core for Underserved Populations that will develop a strong partnership with junior and senior Underrepresented Minority (URM) investigators at the Morehouse School of Medicine. A.

Since 1980, rates of obesity in the United States have increased greatly, and Mississippi typically has among the highest rates of obesity in the nation, particularly among African Americans. We are proposing to establish a research center that will focus on obesity, studying questions from basic biology to issues of diet and lifestyle, and seeking treatments, including efforts to change diet and exercise habits that can help reduce obesity and the problems it causes, and also reduce racial and ethnic disparities related to obesity.                ",Mississippi Center for Clinical and Translational Research,9785261,U54GM115428,"['Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Industry ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Louisiana ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mississippi ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Rural Community ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Logistics ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' authority ', ' Ethics Consultation ', ' resource guides ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Biostatistics Core ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' NIGMS ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' investigator training ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Monitor ', ' Office of Administrative Management ', ' Administrative Management ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' obesity treatment ', ' implementation research ', ' next generation ', ' diet and exercise ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Center for Translational Science Activities ', ' translational sciences center ', ' translational research center ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' faculty research ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' clinical implementation ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,U54,2019,3989919,0.16889287042359097
"Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network IDeA-CTR MW CTR-IN Program -- Abstract  The diverse Mountain West (MW) population continues to be plagued by high rates of health disparities (HD) and lower life expectancy rates when compared to the rest of the US1. The MW Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network (CTR-IN) was established in 2013. During the last 4 years, we have created an impactful and transformative research network with our 13 MW university partners located geographically among 7 Institutional Development Award (IDeA) states to address the health disparities affecting the MW population in Year 6-10. Yet, despite this huge territory and an overall insufficient regional clinical research infrastructure, we have successfully created and implemented a highly functional CTR-IN program in the last 4 years that has seeded a transformative culture of CTR among the 13 MW universities. Over the last 4 years, we created and implemented 4 highly productive Cores consisting of Pilot Grants, Biostatistics, Professional Development and Administration that have positioned us to focus on addressing the health disparities in our MW region for the next 5 years.  Hence, we propose to expand the original mission of the MW CTR-IN Program by further enhancing the research infrastructure in the 7 MW IDeA states for the conduct of rigorous clinical and translational research (CTR) focused on health disparities. The 3 major themes of our proposal are as follows: (1) CTR focused on the MW health disparities; (2) Priority on the professional development of the MW junior faculty investigators; and (3) Providing leadership to the other IDeA programs & Universities in the MW region. Hence, we are proposing 4 major aims to focus our activities on the health disparities in the MW region through rigorous CTR as follows: Aim 1. Enhance the infrastructure and human resources required to conduct rigorous CTR in our 7 IDeA MW states at our 13 major public university partners. Aim 2. Focus on the health disparities experienced by our diverse populations such as the medically underserved and/or rural communities in our 7 IDeA MW states through our CTR programs. Aim 3. Enhance the ability of our IDeA universities and investigators to develop competitive clinical and translational research grants for subsequent extramural funding. Aim 4. Foster increased collaboration and coordination of clinical and translational activities within and across our 7 MW IDeA states and our 13 MW university partners. Overall -- Project Narrative In our 7 Mountain West (MW) IDeA states, health disparities are a major health crisis. During the past four years, the MW CTR-IN program has established a research infrastructure working in conjunction with our 13 MW University partners located geographically among our 7 IDeA states.

"West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute: Improving Health through Partnerships and Transformative Research Mortality rates in Appalachia have progressively increased over recent years, in contrast to decreasing mortality rates observed in the remainder of the US. West Virginia was ranked 47th overall among the 50 states in the 2015 America's Health Rankings. In addition, WV remains at, or near, the bottom for a number of chronic diseases including cancer and cardiovascular disease. These observations alone do not capture the entire continuum of health related challenges in the state or region, but clearly emphasize the need for continued focus on, and investment in, research that underpins real solutions. The West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI) was created in 2012 through the initial Clinical and Translational Research (CTR) award and has subsequently formed a well-connected, statewide research network, creating the infrastructure to address the substantial health disparities that exist in West Virginia. The overarching goal of the WVCTSI is to serve as a collaborative hub to lead statewide innovation in clinical and translational research, catalyzing and accelerating development of solutions to vexing health problems. Over the past four years, WVCTSI has been a transformative force, implementing investigator mentoring services, establishing pilot project funding, forming a practice-based research network of 68 sites (mostly rural), creating an integrated data repository of two million unique electronic medical records, developing a broad-based culture of research integrity, and working with our partners to establish trust and effective collaboration. WVCTSI is now well positioned to attain the goals of this renewal application that include: 1) building sustainable research infrastructure that substantively contributes to improving WV health outcomes by 2022, 2) recruiting the next generation of clinician scientists and translational researchers that excel in team science and are positioned for long-term success, and 3) actively engaging with multiple stakeholders that include communities, medical providers, and policy makers to drive research that improves health of West Virginians. Our partners include all academic medical centers within the state as well as the University of Kentucky, the Veterans Administration, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Through its collective activities and powerful partnerships, the WVCTSI will play a critical role in reversing the trend of increasing mortality rates in West Virginia and serve as a model for developing effective research infrastructure that provides solutions to regional health issues. Mortality rates in Appalachia have progressively increased over recent years, in contrast to decreasing rates observed in the remainder of the United States.

"CDU-CRECD Mentored Postdoctoral Training in Translational Research and Biomedical Informatics Program PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed CDU-CRECD Mentored Postdoctoral Training in Translational Research and Biomedical Informatics Program at Charles R. Drew University (CDU) is a mentored clinical research and career development program designed to develop a diverse cadre of clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States (e.g., cancer, drug use and addiction, and mental health/psychiatric disorders), and to foster and facilitate professional development activities in clinical and translational sciences. Over the proposed 5-year program period, the CDU-CRECD Program will accept a total of 12 minority postdoctoral trainees at the junior faculty level at CDU. Phase I is comprised of two years of structured mentoring and support for earning a Master of Public Health (MPH) in Urban Health Disparities with a dual focus on the fields of Biomedical Informatics and Community Participatory Clinical Translational Research. Phase II is comprised of a clinical/translational research project to continue working toward establishing their own independent research program as clinical research scientists leading to applications for individual mentored career development (K) or research grant (R series) awards. The CRECD Program will be embedded within the existing, extensive clinical research and training infrastructure at CDU, and thus will mutually leverage resources with other CDU research education and career development programs so as to achieve maximal cross-program synergies as well as efficiencies from utilizing already-in-place education and training curricula and related resources germane to the CRECD agenda. The CRECD Program will also carve out a unique niche of training and career development opportunities within the broader CDU science- generating “critical mass” by (1) focusing exclusively on urban health disparities and mastery of biomedical informatics and community-partnered participatory methods in the research and research training agenda and (2) providing to each trainee an intensive and community-immersive mentoring configuration that includes CDU faculty from both the conventional Academic Career track and the Community Faculty track. This intensive mentoring innovation directly emerges from, and formalizes and systematizes into a signature trainee mentoring configuration, a long and fruitful history of community-engaged research, training, and educational curricula at CDU. As an integrated research training and career development package, this approach is designed to bring social determinants of health to the forefront of molecular and clinical research. Ultimately, the goal is to increase the impact of community-academic partnered research through comprehensive dissemination of research findings so as to encourage and facilitate implementation of evidence-based treatment and prevention practices within health care organizations and the communities most in need of reliable access to high-quality care. PROJECT NARRATIVE By providing underrepresented junior faculty and postdoctoral scholars the opportunity to earn a Master of Public Health (MPH) in Urban Health Disparities with a dual focus on the fields of Biomedical Informatics and Community Based Participatory Research, followed by intensive research mentoring, training, and career development, this renewal of the CRECD Program at Charles R.

"Hispanic Clinical and Translational Research Education and Career Development (HCTRECD) Program The Hispanic Clinical and Translational Research Education and Career Development (HCTRECD) program at the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus (UPR-MSC) has a documented track record of increasing diversity in clinical and translational research by supporting research career development of Hispanics since 2002. Our program consists of formal research training (Phase I) through an established institutionally supported post-doctoral Master of Science in Clinical and Translational Research (MSc). We have already enrolled 89 health professionals from multiple disciplines, including medicine, occupational therapy, audiology, dental medicine, nursing, pharmacy and psychology, among others. These scholars have become leaders in clinical and translational research and health disparities and have produced 150 peer revie wed publications and 62 grant submissions on topics that disproportionately affect Hispanics. The most qualified graduates from Phase I compete to receive additional support for advanced clinical research experiences through Phase II. We have been successful in supporting 10 phase II scholars who have moved on to become independent clinical researchers. In addition, our program has contributed new knowledge on how to recruit and train professionals from underrepresented groups through active leadership in national programs and a productive publication record. The research that has been supported by the HCTRECD has added important knowledge to relevant areas of health disparities research among Hispanics including cancer, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, infant/maternal health, and mental health. The purpose of this renewal application is to develop and implement innovations that will strengthen our program. These enhancements will lead to more Hispanics entering the clinical and translational research workforce and t o new knowledge on how to reduce health disparities. Our proposed improvements are based on what we have learned from our 14-year trajectory training Hispanic clinical researchers. The overall goal of the HCTRECD program is to increase the number of Hispanics performing clinical and translational research while also increasing the knowledge on the causes and interventions that can help reduce health disparities. In order to continue pursuing this goal, we will now achieve the following specific aims: 1) Enhance the didactic program by providing our scholars with individualized training on advanced research tracks such as precision medicine, patient centered methodologies, population health and clinical trials and 2) Enrich the mentored research experiences to address the individual clinical and translational research skills needs of our scholars.

"Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science: A Partnership to Improve Health Contact PD/PI: Clark, Robert A. Overall-Abstract San Antonio, positioned at the gateway to South Texas, is the 7th largest US city and the largest metropolitan area with a minority-majority population. Our 38-county region comprises an impoverished, rural, and largely Hispanic population with disproportionate rates of diabetes, obesity, and cancer, exacerbated by lack of health insurance and poor access to care. The region is home to major US military facilities, including the world's largest military medical complex. Service members and veterans form populations with special needs. Neither better access to care nor improved care delivery, on their own, can eliminate health disparities. Innovative translational research is required to fill knowledge gaps and establish real-world effectiveness to improve health. In 2006, UT Health Science Center-San Antonio established the Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science (IIMS) as the academic home for our growing translational science initiatives, training the translational science workforce, formalizing key strategic partnerships, and creating a community of scholars within a learning healthcare system. We expanded clinical research programs, dramatically increasing access to clinical trials. We developed 6 Practice-Based Research Networks that focus on diverse ambulatory populations. We created 6 county-wide Translational Advisory Boards that support engagement through priority setting and matching with academic investigators. IIMS pioneered IRB process harmonization, resulting in rapid review times and streamlined pathways to multisite study initiation. We operate a robust pilot grant program, leveraged among our partners, with a remarkable return on investment. Our workforce development programs, with matriculants reflecting our diverse population, have graduated 133 masters degree students, supported 27 successful KL2 Scholars and 16 TL1 Scholars, and established de novo a Translational Science PhD program. Our informatics team has led electronic health record data warehouse development, fostering matches between IIMS investigators and practice-relevant research priorities. IIMS is now poised to deploy our robust portfolio of programs across our growing, leveraged, and innovative network of institutional and community partners. In this proposal, we provide clear strategies to support clinical and translational science across partner organizations, catalyze research team success, and implement programs that produce creative, collaborative, and culturally diverse translational scientists. IIMS seeks exceptionalism in translating scientific discoveries across the T1 to T4 spectrum into improved health care outcomes. Our over-arching Specific Aims are:  1. Accelerate clinical and translational research innovation and team science along the entire T1 to T4  research spectrum by providing an academic home integrated with our strategic partner institutions  2. Expand, diversify, and enhance the workforce of interdisciplinary translational biomedical scientists  3. Implement effective methods to continuously evaluate and optimize services, increase efficiencies,  improve processes, endorse common metrics, and reduce costs across all IIMS programs Project Summary/Abstract Page 237 Contact PD/PI: Clark, Robert A. PROJECT NARRATIVE The vision of the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science is to improve health and reduce disparities by accelerating scientific discoveries and applications across the full translational research spectrum. We will accomplish this by strategic resource deployment, focusing on prevalent challenges in our region, including: 1) the health needs of our underserved Hispanic and rural populations, 2) the special health issues facing active- duty military and veteran populations, and 3) limitations in the translational science workforce required to fill in critical knowledge gaps and improve health in South Texas and the US.

This diversity informs our highly individualized and competency based training program, anchored by equally-diverse dual/team mentorship in order to favor the pursuit of collaborative interdisciplinary team science addressing important health disparities. Plans are proposed to recruit highly qualified women, members of underrepresented minority groups and scholars with self-identified disabilities into our program. Scholar training plans, each constructed in response to a carefully-developed individualized development plan (IDP), flexibly but rigorously address the core competencies in translational research while developing the skills, attitudes, and behaviors that favor collaboration in team science. All scholars are educated in the responsible conduct of research, are offered mentored experiences to develop skills needed for their proposed research, are educated in human health and disease-related aspects of their research, are given practical training in grant writing and peer review, rigorous research and analytic methods, and skills in scientific communication. Likewise, their mentors are carefully-selected and rigorously trained. We propose an evaluation plan that focused on both program process and outcomes for scholars (during and after training), mentors, curricula, educational experiences, program leadership and administration along with specific metrics and advisory committee input in order to favor critical revision and continued improvement of the proposed career development program.

"Institutional Career Development Core The objective of the Institutional Career Development Core (KL2), known locally as the Johns Hopkins Clinical Research Scholars Program, is to develop and support junior faculty from within the Johns Hopkins University and University of Maryland Baltimore Schools of Medicine, Public Health, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Engineering to become independent, ethical, innovative, and transformative clinical and translational research leaders. Scholars gain broad knowledge of the translational research pathway, acquire the skills to adapt and enhance translational research models, and are able to work creatively and collaboratively within multidisciplinary team environments to advance and generate new knowledge to improve human health. Fundamental program elements include advanced didactic coursework, practical training in conducting research, completion of a grant writing course, exposure to innovative research approaches and technology, “hands on” mentored research experience, and comprehensive career development activities designed to create an environment that encourages an interdisciplinary approach and maximizes the probability of successful careers in clinical and translational research. All Scholars will learn the basics about biodesign methods, “big data” approaches, academic entrepreneurship, and health disparities. The KL2 program will support nine junior faculty Scholars for 2 years, followed by an assurance of an additional year of support by the nominating divisions. The new program will merge the existing strengths within the Johns Hopkins Schools of Medicine, Public Health, Nursing, and Engineering, as well as the Johns Hopkins Health System with the expertise at our new ICTR partner at the University of Maryland Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Dentistry, Social Work, and Law, as well as the University of Maryland Medical Center. Integration of these programs will lead to trainee-centered, multidisciplinary learning and enhance junior faculty access to advanced training, especially those from disciplines without a history of formally trained clinical researchers; maximize possibilities for the widest possible cross-fertilization among disciplines; create core resources that facilitate top-notch research by junior faculty who may otherwise lack the resources to hire adequate analytic, statistical, and technical support; and heighten the impact of the approach on the culture of the institution. The intended outcome of the KL2 program is to develop and train the next generation of researchers, who are equipped with a foundation of skills in clinical and translational research, who will successfully transition to career development programs, e.g. K08 or K23 mentored clinician scientist awards, and ultimately to an independent career in clinical and translational research.

"Institutional Clinical AND Translational Science Award Overall Project Summary: The University of Wisconsin (UW) Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) was created in 2007 against a backdrop of institutional change at UW during which the UW Medical School pivoted to become a School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH, 2005) and the other Health Sciences Schools retooled their missions to encompass health maintenance, preventative care, and improvements in health-delivery systems. Since its inception, ICTR succeeded in changing the culture of research at UW and at Marshfield Clinic (MC) and became recognized as the academic and administrative home for clinical and translational science. This section outlines the most notable ICTR accomplishments leading to transformative changes in the broad areas of administration, education of the translational workforce, and expansion of the research infrastructure. Many of the administrative successes were aligned with development of mutually- beneficial, collaborative relationships including the foundational UW and MC partnership, establishment of multi-site research networks, cross-CTSA program development, braided federal and local funding for ICTR programs and pilot awards, and affiliation with other UW centers and programs with overlapping missions. Translational workforce development included creating vigorous TL1 and KL2 training programs, establishing graduate degree and certificate programs in Clinical Investigation, and offering diverse non-degree options for learners at multiple levels and tracks. Additional collaborative efforts led to a nationally recognized program in research mentor training and the Health Equity Leadership Institute, a career development experience for investigators engaged in health disparities/health equity research. The central fact illustrating the expansion of the UW research infrastructure is that ICTR resources and services supported ~2,500 unique investigators, who have pursued 3,824 research projects. ICTR has provided pilot funding across the T0-T4 translational spectrum including awards specific to pediatric, geriatric, and minority populations. Consultations and other expert services span biostatistics, bioinformatics, laboratory services, and an array of clinical and regulatory services. Finally, the ICTR community engagement program is recognized as a national model for how to create partnerships with community stakeholders and organizations (431 to date) and now includes dissemination and implementation programs. Significantly, this section also provides examples of how ICTR- supported research programs have already impacted health care and health in Wisconsin and nationally. In the next grant cycle, ICTR will continue to address translational workforce development with an emphasis on team science and competency-based training, and community engagement in research with novel strategies for implementation of health advances and involvement of patient advocates. Additionally, the research infrastructure will be continuously improved through cycles of quality improvement and innovation and informatics methods for translational research will be introduced. Special populations research will be integrated across the T0-T4 spectrum and across the lifespan. Project Summary/Abstract Page 126 Contact PD/PI: DREZNER, MARC K  Overall - CTSA As a member of the NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards program since 2007, the mission of the University of Wisconsin (UW) Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) is to improve public health by translating basic research discoveries into direct, practical improvements in clinical care and health care delivery systems. Current ICTR-supported research programs have already directly impacted community health in Wisconsin and nationally. ICTR represents a partnership of five UW Health Sciences Schools and Marshfield Clinic who work synchronously to improve research infrastructure, enhance local and multisite collaborative research networks, engage patient advocates and community stakeholders in research, and train the future clinical and translational research workforce.

"Institutional Career Development Contact PD/PI: Murphy, Timothy F Inst-Career-Dev-001 (493) KL2 Mentored Career Development Award. The CTSA-Linked KL2 mentored career development award program (KL2 program) will strive to engage talented and motivated scholars to join the clinical and translational science workforce with the goal of developing new diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic interventions for diseases, with an emphasis on addressing health disparities. The KL2 program has stimulated clinical and translational research across the Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC) by attracting, mentoring, training and engaging scholars with diverse cultural, ethnic, racial and professional backgrounds and across scientific disciplines (i.e. RN-PhDs, PharmDs, PhDs, MDs, and/or DDS-PhDs). These scholars receive an interprofessional and interdisciplinary education where they learn with, about, and from each other, enabling effective collaboration and discoveries in clinical and translational research. In the proposed funding period, the KL2 program will train at least four junior faculty physician scientist scholars by supporting them for two years on their path to independence, with the option of receiving an additional third year of institutional funding upon completion of the program curriculum and objective evaluation of scholarly accomplishments. The program is complemented by and integrated with the institutionally-funded BTC scholars program, allowing us to train five (three in years 1-3; two in years 3-5) additional scholars under the same terms during the next funding period. Integration of all scholars’ activities under our well-established mentoring and training program brings together a critical mass of diverse professional experiences and talent benefiting all involved. The KL2 program has three specific aims towards these goals are: 1) attract skilled and motivated early career clinical and translational investigators from a broad range of health science disciplines, including individuals underrepresented in health science; 2) provide comprehensive tailored support to mentor and train the scholars to promote pathways to independence; and 3) engage scholars, facilitate interactions and enhance communications with the community to raise awareness and accelerate solutions for health disparities. Innovations in our KL2 program include the awarding of digital badges followed by micro-credentials, which are competency-based documentation of training in specific areas; inclusion of community agency advisors and partners on scholars’ mentoring teams, aligning with our goal to address health disparities in our community; and extensive partnering with other CTSA hubs. The program will mentor, train and develop KL2 scholars’ professional skills and facilitate a seamless transition to their next career level in the clinical and translational workforce. The overall goal of this KL2 program is to develop the next generation of 21st century leaders whose backgrounds mirror the diversity of our community to enhance excellence in clinical and translational research, locally and across the nation.

This application is for our second competitive renewal. The specific aims of GHUCCTS are presently: 1) To continue to improve the infrastructure that supports high quality, interdisciplinary clinical and translational research, both via inter-institutional collaborations among GHUCCTS institutions as well as multicenter clinical trials across the national CTSA consortium, with increasing efficiency; 2) To further establish GHUCCTS as a model of inter-institutional collaboration that leverages the strengths and attributes of its diverse participating institutions in order to maintain GHUCCTS as a regional CTSA hub with unique and synergistic strengths; 3) To leverage our location, expertise and the co-leadership of a minority-serving institution to design, implement and disseminate clinical and translational research that will have a high impact on populations with health disparities, particularly underserved groups in our communities who have been historically under- represented in clinical research studies, including people from diverse racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds, people with disabilities, older adults and Veterans; 4) To continue to provide new vibrant and innovative educational programs for multiple levels of trainees, faculty and staff that promote principles of team science, and to provide the high quality career development training and support for the clinical and translational investigators of the future; and 5) To continue to apply and develop innovative analytical and computational methods to speed and enhance translation. In achieving these specific aims and their corresponding strategic goals we will draw from and contribute to the collective efforts and mission of the National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS), and the national CTSA consortium. In the first 8 years as a funded CTSA program, GHUCCTS evolved into a fully functional multi-institutional center that has transformed CTR across each of the GHUCCTS member institutions with growing inter-institutional and inter-disciplinary collaboration and mentorship. Enrollment of under-represented groups is high in our research studies, and have increased to levels that more than double the national CTSA hub mean in our training programs. We have designed a new core in collaboration with ORNL that leverages their novel technologies to address environmental determinants of health risk in the District of Columbia.

"Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training Contact PD/PI: Heubi, James E OVERALL ABSTRACT The Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training (CCTST) was established at the University of Cincinnati (UC) in 2005 and awarded an institutional Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) in 2009. Since that time, basic science research, genomics, technology, and drug development have made remarkable progress, warranting new solutions for translating research to practice. Concurrent with these discoveries, the CCTST has created innovative solutions for our program functions, including biomedical informatics, biostatistics and study design, regulatory and ethics, community engagement and team science, recruitment and support for clinical trials, patient care interactions, pilot grants, and translational workforce development. With the competitive renewal application and the current revision and creation of CCTST 3.0, we will continue to utilize the guiding principles of learning health systems to develop stronger bidirectional relationships with our community and expeditiously bring discoveries to application. Indeed, we intend to capture this tremendous opportunity to better align the clinical/operational mission of the health system with the research mission of the University and its affiliates. The overarching goal of the CCTST is to maximize the impact of clinical and translational research to improve individual and population health locally and nationally, through 1) engaging stakeholders to collaboratively translate research into improved health care practice and community wellness across the lifespan; 2) developing a diverse, multidisciplinary workforce to conduct innovative, team-based, community-engaged translational research and to disseminate and implement findings that will improve health outcomes and reduce disparities; and 3) optimizing the use of biomedical data across the translational research continuum using innovative data science methods to advance discovery, dissemination, and implementation. For each of the programs and optional functions, these aims serve as the basis for planned innovative activities and to facilitate cross-core integration. We specifically target learning health systems as an optional module for this application because of the expertise available at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center that can be leveraged across the CCTST and its health care affiliates. In fulfilling these aims, CCTST 3.0 will catalyze the translation of discoveries into improved health outcomes locally and nationally. Page 307 Project Summary/Abstract Contact PD/PI: Heubi, James E NARRATIVE The CTSA consortium has matured to the point that 57 sites are working together to advance science with the goal to improve the health of the nation. The University of Cincinnati Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training has become a portal of entry for clinical and translational investigators to obtain support for the completion of their studies across the spectrum of translational science, from the bench to population health.

"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"Accelerating Excellence in Translational Science (AXIS) Abstract: Proposed Program Overview. The Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science proposes to continue the enhancement and success of the Accelerating Excellence in Translational Science (AXIS) Center. AXIS has shown to be the integrated hub for research conducted at CDU and continues to provide experienced leadership, and a myriad of clinical, translational, and community partnered activities. In the next five years, research will continue to grow and expand its enterprise alongside the Universities vision and mission to be a leader in eliminating health disparities by translating scientific discoveries into education, training, clinical care, treatment, and community service in three areas of focus which disproportionally affect Service Planning Area 6: Cancer, Cardiometabolic Disease (CMD), and HIV/AIDS. In addition, we look to build upon the application of Precision Medicine to understand and eliminate health disparities, while utilizing many of CDU’s outstanding resources in: Advanced Technologies such as Next Generation Sequencing for identifying Genomic Data; Drug Discovery; Integrated Clinical Tissues, Biorepository and Bio banking Facility; Clinical Studies/Trials Resources; Medical Bioinformatics; and Methods for Statistical and Epidemiological Studies. This approach will pave the pathway for CDU’s in becoming a competitive institution with sophisticated resources and services to better serve our communities. To accomplish this, we propose to continue with the three programmatic goals that align with the mission, vision, and strategic plan for the universities research enterprise: Goal 1: To enhance the infrastructure capacity in translational research using Precision Medicine model in the areas of Cancer, Cardiometabolic, and HIV/AIDS. Provide support for the emerging research pillars in Mental Health and Health Services Goal 2: To continue the integration of basic, clinical, behavioral and community-partnered research by fostering collaboration among disciplines, departments and schools at CDU, and sustainable collaboration with community leaders and investigators across other research institutions. Goal 3: To facilitate and elevate professional development and best practices in mentored clinical and translational research training on minority health and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The predominant ethnic and racial demographics of residents in South Los Angeles, Service Planning Area 6 is Hispanic/Latino (68%) and African American (27%). These communities reside in one of the most underserved and under-resourced location, where access to health care and socio- economic standards are lower than any other county in Los Angeles and in the US. As a result, these communities are more often diagnosed with chronic conditions associated with Obesity, Diabetes, Hypertension, Infectious Diseases, and Mental Health.

"University of Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years. A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation. We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region, opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in 2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium; 2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively contribute to the national consortium. The University at Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) is the coordinating center of the Buffalo Translational Consortium, which includes the region's premier research, educational and clinical institutions with influential community partners.

"UNM HSC Clinical and Translational Science Center Contact PD/PI: LARSON, RICHARD S UNM HSC CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE CENTER: OVERALL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our vision for the University of New Mexico (UNM) Health Sciences Center (HSC) Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) is to catalyze scientific discovery into improved health by enabling high quality clinical and translational research (CTR) – locally, regionally, and nationally. It is not an exaggeration that in our first two funding cycles (CTSC 1.0 funded in 2010 and CTSC 2.0 funded in 2015), UNM CTSC created a research ecosystem that transformed UNM HSC by providing needed services and training, demonstrating and disseminating methods and processes to support CTR, and building new partnerships, all of which substantially grew our research enterprise and its impact. We accomplished this by building on local strengths and addressing geographic and demographic needs. Being an agent of continuous improvement, we will further enhance our activities in CTSC 3.0. During CTSC 1.0 and 2.0, we catalyzed CTR through new training and services. These activities and findings were disseminated to CTR partners in all 34 counties statewide, including health organizations, community providers, social service agencies, K-12 schools, industry, and others. This established UNM CTSC as the academic focal point for CTR at UNM HSC, in NM, and in our regional consortium, which includes 7 states and 13 public universities. With this landscape, we are positioned to achieve the mission laid out by NCATS for CTSA hubs to “support high quality collaborative translational science locally, regionally, and nationally; foster scientific and operational innovation to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical translational research; and create, provide, and disseminate domain-specific translational science training and workforce development.” We will accomplish this through 5 aims: 1) build a diverse, sustainable biomedical research workforce, and ensure that investigators and their teams have skills and knowledge necessary to advance the translation of discoveries through innovations and execution of our career development, workforce training and related programs; 2) engage in beneficial collaboration and partnerships locally, regionally, and nationally; and includes stakeholder engagement at all stages of CTR; 3) discover, develop, demonstrate, and disseminate innovative research resources, methods, and processes to catalyze CTR from discovery to implementation in communities; 4) further integrate multiple phases and disciplines across the translational research spectrum and include special populations across the lifespan to ensure that translational advances are realized in all populations; and 5) expand our informatics capabilities with innovative solutions to deliver tools, training, collaboration, dissemination of best practices, and EHR data to accelerate the science and operations of CTR. By accomplishing these aims, CTSC 3.0 will: 1) continue expansion of CTR in NM and the MWRC; 2) catalyze new discoveries and developments, demonstrate efficacy, and disseminate findings through our resources and services; and 3) address health disparities, geographic and rural challenges, and special populations in our state and region.

"Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network IDeA-CTR MW CTR-IN Program -- Abstract  The diverse Mountain West (MW) population continues to be plagued by high rates of health disparities (HD) and lower life expectancy rates when compared to the rest of the US1. The MW Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network (CTR-IN) was established in 2013. During the last 4 years, we have created an impactful and transformative research network with our 13 MW university partners located geographically among 7 Institutional Development Award (IDeA) states to address the health disparities affecting the MW population in Year 6-10. Yet, despite this huge territory and an overall insufficient regional clinical research infrastructure, we have successfully created and implemented a highly functional CTR-IN program in the last 4 years that has seeded a transformative culture of CTR among the 13 MW universities. Over the last 4 years, we created and implemented 4 highly productive Cores consisting of Pilot Grants, Biostatistics, Professional Development and Administration that have positioned us to focus on addressing the health disparities in our MW region for the next 5 years.  Hence, we propose to expand the original mission of the MW CTR-IN Program by further enhancing the research infrastructure in the 7 MW IDeA states for the conduct of rigorous clinical and translational research (CTR) focused on health disparities. The 3 major themes of our proposal are as follows: (1) CTR focused on the MW health disparities; (2) Priority on the professional development of the MW junior faculty investigators; and (3) Providing leadership to the other IDeA programs & Universities in the MW region. Hence, we are proposing 4 major aims to focus our activities on the health disparities in the MW region through rigorous CTR as follows: Aim 1. Enhance the infrastructure and human resources required to conduct rigorous CTR in our 7 IDeA MW states at our 13 major public university partners. Aim 2. Focus on the health disparities experienced by our diverse populations such as the medically underserved and/or rural communities in our 7 IDeA MW states through our CTR programs. Aim 3. Enhance the ability of our IDeA universities and investigators to develop competitive clinical and translational research grants for subsequent extramural funding. Aim 4. Foster increased collaboration and coordination of clinical and translational activities within and across our 7 MW IDeA states and our 13 MW university partners. Overall -- Project Narrative In our 7 Mountain West (MW) IDeA states, health disparities are a major health crisis. During the past four years, the MW CTR-IN program has established a research infrastructure working in conjunction with our 13 MW University partners located geographically among our 7 IDeA states. The MW CTR-IN program plans to expand the original mission of the CTR-IN program by further enhancing the research infrastructure of the MW region for the conduct of rigorous clinical and translational research to focus on health disparities in years 6-10.",Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network IDeA-CTR,9979968,U54GM104944,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Rest ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Rural Community ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' programs ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Stretching ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Coordination and Collaboration ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' medically underserved ', ' operation ', ' Core Grant ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translational research program ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS,U54,2020,7108712,0.1874873944271167

"West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute: Improving Health through Partnerships and Transformative Research Emergence of a novel coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), has resulted in human disease (COVID-19) that has swept the globe in pandemic proportions with more than eight million confirmed cases and >440,000 deaths to date. Surges of COVID-19 have occurred throughout the United States (US) with urban centers such as New York City and New Orleans hardest hit. COVID-19 clinical descriptions have evolved from what was initially felt to be a respiratory illness to a multisystem disease with protean manifestations. Moreover, disparities in outcomes have been described with African Americans having higher infection and mortality rates. Populations residing in rural areas are often poorer, older, and have multiple co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes, obesity and hypertension, raising questions about disease manifestations and outcomes that may differ from those described in urban areas. COVID-19 cases and mortality in rural areas continues to climb with multiple outbreaks, many of which have been related to meat packing plants and prison clusters. The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) has been established by the National Center for Data to Health (CD2H) in partnership with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) for purposes of building a centralized national data resource for the study of COVID-19. As N3C will facilitate translation of data into knowledge urgently needed to effectively address the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critically important that this resource contain patient outcomes data from diverse populations throughout the US – both urban and rural – with inclusion of populations of color, Native Americans, and others. The Institutional Development Award Program Clinical Translational Research Centers (IDeA CTRs) are located in diverse areas of the US, serving rural populations as well as other vulnerable groups, including Native Americans and persons of color. IDeA CTRs are well poised to provide outcomes data that relate to a diverse group of medically underserved persons that may otherwise not receive adequate representation in the N3C. Specifically, eight IDeA CTRs located in Delaware, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and West Virginia have established relationships with healthcare organizations that have, to date, have conducted SARS CoV-2 testing among more than 285,000 persons, of whom more than 25,000 have tested positive. This project will enable rapid contribution of COVID-19 patient data from IDeA states to N3C, enhancing understanding of COVID-19 in the US and driving further research addressing COVID-19 patient outcomes in multiple underserved populations.

"West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute: Improving Health through Partnerships and Transformative Research Mortality rates in Appalachia have progressively increased over recent years, in contrast to decreasing mortality rates observed in the remainder of the US. West Virginia was ranked 47th overall among the 50 states in the 2015 America's Health Rankings. In addition, WV remains at, or near, the bottom for a number of chronic diseases including cancer and cardiovascular disease. These observations alone do not capture the entire continuum of health related challenges in the state or region, but clearly emphasize the need for continued focus on, and investment in, research that underpins real solutions. The West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI) was created in 2012 through the initial Clinical and Translational Research (CTR) award and has subsequently formed a well-connected, statewide research network, creating the infrastructure to address the substantial health disparities that exist in West Virginia. The overarching goal of the WVCTSI is to serve as a collaborative hub to lead statewide innovation in clinical and translational research, catalyzing and accelerating development of solutions to vexing health problems. Over the past four years, WVCTSI has been a transformative force, implementing investigator mentoring services, establishing pilot project funding, forming a practice-based research network of 68 sites (mostly rural), creating an integrated data repository of two million unique electronic medical records, developing a broad-based culture of research integrity, and working with our partners to establish trust and effective collaboration. WVCTSI is now well positioned to attain the goals of this renewal application that include: 1) building sustainable research infrastructure that substantively contributes to improving WV health outcomes by 2022, 2) recruiting the next generation of clinician scientists and translational researchers that excel in team science and are positioned for long-term success, and 3) actively engaging with multiple stakeholders that include communities, medical providers, and policy makers to drive research that improves health of West Virginians. Our partners include all academic medical centers within the state as well as the University of Kentucky, the Veterans Administration, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

"Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science: A Partnership to Improve Health San Antonio, positioned at the gateway to South Texas, is the 7th largest US city and the largest metropolitan area with a minority-majority population. Our 38-county region comprises an impoverished, rural, and largely Hispanic population with disproportionate rates of diabetes, obesity, and cancer, exacerbated by lack of health insurance and poor access to care. The region is home to major US military facilities, including the world's largest military medical complex. Service members and veterans form populations with special needs. Neither better access to care nor improved care delivery, on their own, can eliminate health disparities. Innovative translational research is required to fill knowledge gaps and establish real-world effectiveness to improve health. In 2006, UT Health Science Center-San Antonio established the Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science (IIMS) as the academic home for our growing translational science initiatives, training the translational science workforce, formalizing key strategic partnerships, and creating a community of scholars within a learning healthcare system. We expanded clinical research programs, dramatically increasing access to clinical trials. We developed 6 Practice-Based Research Networks that focus on diverse ambulatory populations. We created 6 county-wide Translational Advisory Boards that support engagement through priority setting and matching with academic investigators. IIMS pioneered IRB process harmonization, resulting in rapid review times and streamlined pathways to multisite study initiation. We operate a robust pilot grant program, leveraged among our partners, with a remarkable return on investment. Our workforce development programs, with matriculants reflecting our diverse population, have graduated 133 masters degree students, supported 27 successful KL2 Scholars and 16 TL1 Scholars, and established de novo a Translational Science PhD program. Our informatics team has led electronic health record data warehouse development, fostering matches between IIMS investigators and practice-relevant research priorities. IIMS is now poised to deploy our robust portfolio of programs across our growing, leveraged, and innovative network of institutional and community partners. In this proposal, we provide clear strategies to support clinical and translational science across partner organizations, catalyze research team success, and implement programs that produce creative, collaborative, and culturally diverse translational scientists. IIMS seeks exceptionalism in translating scientific discoveries across the T1 to T4 spectrum into improved health care outcomes. Our over-arching Specific Aims are:  1. Accelerate clinical and translational research innovation and team science along the entire T1 to T4  research spectrum by providing an academic home integrated with our strategic partner institutions  2. Expand, diversify, and enhance the workforce of interdisciplinary translational biomedical scientists  3. Implement effective methods to continuously evaluate and optimize services, increase efficiencies,  improve processes, endorse common metrics, and reduce costs across all IIMS programs The vision of the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science is to improve health and reduce disparities by accelerating scientific discoveries and applications across the full translational research spectrum. We will accomplish this by strategic resource deployment, focusing on prevalent challenges in our region, including: 1) the health needs of our underserved Hispanic and rural populations, 2) the special health issues facing active- duty military and veteran populations, and 3) limitations in the translational science workforce required to fill in critical knowledge gaps and improve health in South Texas and the US.",Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science: A Partnership to Improve Health,9927715,UL1TR002645,"['health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitals ', ' Institutes ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Investments ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Ohio ', ' Program Development ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Science ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Toxin ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' care delivery ', ' metropolitan ', ' Informatics ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' TL1 ', ' TNF Ligand-Related Molecule 1 ', ' TNF15 ', ' TNFSF15 ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 15 ', ' VEGI ', ' Vascular Endothelial Growth Inhibitor ', ' TNFSF15 gene ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Department of Defense ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Health Sciences ', "" Master's Degree "", ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' practice-based research network ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' South Texas ', ' Trauma ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' faculty mentor ', ' workforce needs ', ' Workforce Development ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' service member ', ' translational investigator ', ' translational researcher ', ' translational scientist ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' Award ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' ']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,UL1,2020,4760141,0.1312675870466927
"Accelerating Excellence in Translational Science (AXIS) Abstract: Proposed Program Overview. The Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science proposes to continue the enhancement and success of the Accelerating Excellence in Translational Science (AXIS) Center. AXIS has shown to be the integrated hub for research conducted at CDU and continues to provide experienced leadership, and a myriad of clinical, translational, and community partnered activities. In the next five years, research will continue to grow and expand its enterprise alongside the Universities vision and mission to be a leader in eliminating health disparities by translating scientific discoveries into education, training, clinical care, treatment, and community service in three areas of focus which disproportionally affect Service Planning Area 6: Cancer, Cardiometabolic Disease (CMD), and HIV/AIDS. In addition, we look to build upon the application of Precision Medicine to understand and eliminate health disparities, while utilizing many of CDU’s outstanding resources in: Advanced Technologies such as Next Generation Sequencing for identifying Genomic Data; Drug Discovery; Integrated Clinical Tissues, Biorepository and Bio banking Facility; Clinical Studies/Trials Resources; Medical Bioinformatics; and Methods for Statistical and Epidemiological Studies. This approach will pave the pathway for CDU’s in becoming a competitive institution with sophisticated resources and services to better serve our communities. To accomplish this, we propose to continue with the three programmatic goals that align with the mission, vision, and strategic plan for the universities research enterprise: Goal 1: To enhance the infrastructure capacity in translational research using Precision Medicine model in the areas of Cancer, Cardiometabolic, and HIV/AIDS. Provide support for the emerging research pillars in Mental Health and Health Services Goal 2: To continue the integration of basic, clinical, behavioral and community-partnered research by fostering collaboration among disciplines, departments and schools at CDU, and sustainable collaboration with community leaders and investigators across other research institutions. Goal 3: To facilitate and elevate professional development and best practices in mentored clinical and translational research training on minority health and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The predominant ethnic and racial demographics of residents in South Los Angeles, Service Planning Area 6 is Hispanic/Latino (68%) and African American (27%). These communities reside in one of the most underserved and under-resourced location, where access to health care and socio- economic standards are lower than any other county in Los Angeles and in the US. As a result, these communities are more often diagnosed with chronic conditions associated with Obesity, Diabetes, Hypertension, Infectious Diseases, and Mental Health. The incidence, morbidity and mortality rates are highest from Cancer, Cardiovascular Diseases, and Infectious Diseases. Our proposed study will focus on understanding how these socio-economic and environmental factors impact cellular, molecular, genetic, and epigenetic drivers that cause poor health outcomes in our communities.

"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research A. Center Overview Project Abstract  Diabetes mellitus is a significant health burden in the United States, affecting more than 20,000,000 people and costing more than $100 billion annually. The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is growing rapidly; the CDC estimates that up to 1/3 of Americans will have diabetes by the year 2050. The burden of T2DM is particularly great among ethnic minority populations and those of lower socioeconomic status. The evidence base for the prevention and care of T2DM is one of the most well-established of any chronic illness: clinical trials have shown the efficacy of cardiometabolic therapies in preventing mortality and morbidity in diabetes, and programs such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) have demonstrated that diabetes can be prevented in high-risk patients. However, the overall quality of care for diabetes remains sub-optimal, significant disparities in diabetes care and prevention persist, and there are very few effective population- based efforts to systematically reduce prevent diabetes and reduce diabetes risk. Programs that can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-based diabetes prevention and treatment into widespread practice are desperately needed.  In response to this need, diabetes researchers at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, and the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) created the Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research (HDS-CDTR) in 2011 (P30 DK092924). This CDTR fosters and supports translational research in diabetes within health care delivery systems affiliated with the Health Care Systems Research Network (formerly known as the HMO Research Network) and with UCSF. The HDS- CDTR brings together a multi-disciplinary network of well-established investigators with a strong history of receiving federal and foundation funding in diabetes translational research. The HDS-CDTR is structured around three Translational Research Cores in the areas of health care disparities; diabetes and obesity prevention; and health information technology. HDS-CDTR investigators have strong relationships with delivery systems, ranging from large integrated delivery systems to networks of safety net providers that serve as key partners for translating effective interventions into real-world clinical settings. Our CDTR will continue to be a strong resource to under- resourced delivery systems across the U.S. through its Resource Core, which will continue and expand our support of these systems in their efforts to provide high quality diabetes prevention and care. In addition, the HDS-CDTR is expanding its mission to address disparities through the creation of a new Core for Underserved Populations that will develop a strong partnership with junior and senior Underrepresented Minority (URM) investigators at the Morehouse School of Medicine. A.

"South Carolina Clinical & Translational Research Institute (SCTR) PROJECT SUMMARY – SCTR INSTITUTE Parent Award UL1-TR001450 Since 2009, the South Carolina Clinical and Translational Research Institute (SCTR) has transformed the research environment across South Carolina (SC) by creating a Learning Health System that supports high- quality clinical and translational research (CTR) and fosters collaboration and innovation. Headquartered at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), SCTR has engaged stakeholders and created statewide partnerships to improve care and address social determinants of health across SC. However, greater than 75% of SC is rural, and all 46 counties contain areas designated as medically underserved, so health disparities remain an issue. Over the next five years, SCTR will strengthen its outreach to these medically underserved areas through collaboration with the Clemson University Health Extension Program and the MUSC Telehealth Center of Excellence. With a focus on implementation and dissemination as well as discovery, we will develop and demonstrate innovative technologies and outreach to improve the health of our stakeholders. We will build on prior successes and introduce innovative approaches to expand CTR across SC through the following aims: Aim 1. Extend and enhance high-quality, innovative, flexible curricula and training experiences for all levels of the CTR workforce, with particular emphasis on enhancing workforce heterogeneity and team science. Aim 2. Engage a diverse group of stakeholders as active partners in CTR to address health care priorities while enhancing the scientific knowledge base about collaboration and engagement. Aim 3. Promote greater inclusion across the full translational spectrum of research by engaging investigators from many disciplines and patient populations from diverse demographic backgrounds and geographic areas. Aim 4. Develop, demonstrate and disseminate innovative methods and processes to address barriers and accelerate the translation of research discoveries to improvements in human health that can be generalized to a variety of practice settings. Aim 5. Enhance the conduct of translational research through the development of secure and innovative informatics and digital health solutions, tools and methodologies that affect every aspect of CTR. SCTR’s vision is to be a major force in facilitating the translation of innovative science into practice to address the health priorities of the citizens of SC and beyond.

"Hispanic Clinical and Translational Research Education and Career Development (HCTRECD) Program The Hispanic Clinical and Translational Research Education and Career Development (HCTRECD) program at the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus (UPR-MSC) has a documented track record of increasing diversity in clinical and translational research by supporting research career development of Hispanics since 2002. Our program consists of formal research training (Phase I) through an established institutionally supported post-doctoral Master of Science in Clinical and Translational Research (MSc). We have already enrolled 89 health professionals from multiple disciplines, including medicine, occupational therapy, audiology, dental medicine, nursing, pharmacy and psychology, among others. These scholars have become leaders in clinical and translational research and health disparities and have produced 150 peer revie wed publications and 62 grant submissions on topics that disproportionately affect Hispanics. The most qualified graduates from Phase I compete to receive additional support for advanced clinical research experiences through Phase II. We have been successful in supporting 10 phase II scholars who have moved on to become independent clinical researchers. In addition, our program has contributed new knowledge on how to recruit and train professionals from underrepresented groups through active leadership in national programs and a productive publication record. The research that has been supported by the HCTRECD has added important knowledge to relevant areas of health disparities research among Hispanics including cancer, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, infant/maternal health, and mental health. The purpose of this renewal application is to develop and implement innovations that will strengthen our program. These enhancements will lead to more Hispanics entering the clinical and translational research workforce and t o new knowledge on how to reduce health disparities. Our proposed improvements are based on what we have learned from our 14-year trajectory training Hispanic clinical researchers. The overall goal of the HCTRECD program is to increase the number of Hispanics performing clinical and translational research while also increasing the knowledge on the causes and interventions that can help reduce health disparities. In order to continue pursuing this goal, we will now achieve the following specific aims: 1) Enhance the didactic program by providing our scholars with individualized training on advanced research tracks such as precision medicine, patient centered methodologies, population health and clinical trials and 2) Enrich the mentored research experiences to address the individual clinical and translational research skills needs of our scholars.

"CDU-CRECD Mentored Postdoctoral Training in Translational Research and Biomedical Informatics Program PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed CDU-CRECD Mentored Postdoctoral Training in Translational Research and Biomedical Informatics Program at Charles R. Drew University (CDU) is a mentored clinical research and career development program designed to develop a diverse cadre of clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States (e.g., cancer, drug use and addiction, and mental health/psychiatric disorders), and to foster and facilitate professional development activities in clinical and translational sciences. Over the proposed 5-year program period, the CDU-CRECD Program will accept a total of 12 minority postdoctoral trainees at the junior faculty level at CDU. Phase I is comprised of two years of structured mentoring and support for earning a Master of Public Health (MPH) in Urban Health Disparities with a dual focus on the fields of Biomedical Informatics and Community Participatory Clinical Translational Research. Phase II is comprised of a clinical/translational research project to continue working toward establishing their own independent research program as clinical research scientists leading to applications for individual mentored career development (K) or research grant (R series) awards. The CRECD Program will be embedded within the existing, extensive clinical research and training infrastructure at CDU, and thus will mutually leverage resources with other CDU research education and career development programs so as to achieve maximal cross-program synergies as well as efficiencies from utilizing already-in-place education and training curricula and related resources germane to the CRECD agenda. The CRECD Program will also carve out a unique niche of training and career development opportunities within the broader CDU science- generating “critical mass” by (1) focusing exclusively on urban health disparities and mastery of biomedical informatics and community-partnered participatory methods in the research and research training agenda and (2) providing to each trainee an intensive and community-immersive mentoring configuration that includes CDU faculty from both the conventional Academic Career track and the Community Faculty track. This intensive mentoring innovation directly emerges from, and formalizes and systematizes into a signature trainee mentoring configuration, a long and fruitful history of community-engaged research, training, and educational curricula at CDU. As an integrated research training and career development package, this approach is designed to bring social determinants of health to the forefront of molecular and clinical research. Ultimately, the goal is to increase the impact of community-academic partnered research through comprehensive dissemination of research findings so as to encourage and facilitate implementation of evidence-based treatment and prevention practices within health care organizations and the communities most in need of reliable access to high-quality care. PROJECT NARRATIVE By providing underrepresented junior faculty and postdoctoral scholars the opportunity to earn a Master of Public Health (MPH) in Urban Health Disparities with a dual focus on the fields of Biomedical Informatics and Community Based Participatory Research, followed by intensive research mentoring, training, and career development, this renewal of the CRECD Program at Charles R.
