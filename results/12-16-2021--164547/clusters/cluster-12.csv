"Disparities in Care: Obesity and Cancer Screening DESCRIPTION: Obesity is the second leading cause of preventable deaths. Cancers of the colon, prostate, breast, and cervix account for many of these deaths. Despite their higher risk, preliminary analyses suggests that women with obesity may be screened less often than women without obesity for breast and cervical cancer. Whether disparities in cancer screening extend to men with obesity is unknown. Because of cultural and gender differences in self- perception, race and sex may also influence the relationship between obesity and disparities in screening. This project will use national data collected as part of the 1998 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to 1) compare the rates of screening for colon, prostate, breast, and cervical cancer between persons with and without obesity based on national screening guidelines, 2) examine whether differences in cancer screening rates associated with obesity vary by sex and race, and 3) examine whether differences in screening rates can be explained entirely by the higher illness burden experienced by persons with obesity. Using statistical modeling, the investigators will quantify differences in screening rates between persons with and without obesity after accounting for sociodemographic factors (such as age, race, education, income, region of the country), access to care, and medical conditions. The investigators will also examine the association between weight and cancer screening in different racial subgroups. For colon cancer screening, the relationship between obesity and screening will be examined among men and women separately. Findings from this project will help determine whether obesity is a barrier to cancer screening and help researchers and clinicians begin to understand factors that contribute to disparities in screening. Recognizing and understanding the role of obesity as a potential barrier to care is the first step towards improving quality of care for patients with obesity.

"CANCER SCREENING, MANAGED CARE, AND THE UNDERSERVED Low-income women are at high risk for developing cervical cancer due not only to the higher prevalence of risk factors and lack of access to screening, but also because of barriers to timely follow-up when screened and found to have an abnormality.  Lack of follow-up, therefore, contributes to the racial and ethnic health outcome disparities that exist for cervical cancer.  While other interventions have shown some success at improving Pap smear follow-up rates, there is no existing randomized intervention trial that has demonstrated such high rates of improvement in follow-up as the Pathfinders study that addresses follow-up barriers in a very high-risk population of ethnically diverse, low-income, inner city women.  The intervention consisted of computer-assisted tracking, education, counseling in consumer skills and ways of coping, transportation vouchers, and referrals for suspected mental health, alcohol/drug abuse, and domestic violence.  When analyzed by intention to treat, of 348 women who were randomized at the time of the institutional receipt of the abnormal result, twice as many women in the intervention group were confirmed to have a follow-up test within 6 mos. of their abnormal Pap smear than in the control group, 70% versus 36% (p<0.01).  By using an expanded tracking protocol, we were able to locate and to deliver the intervention to 128/178 women in the intervention group.  Of those who received the intervention, 83% had a documented follow-up test with 6 mos. versus 36% in the intervention group who did not receive the intervention (p<0.01).  Overall, we were unable to contact 18 (10%) women, 16 (9%) moved, and 11 (6%) refused the counseling intervention.  The average time-cost of tracking and outreach counseling per woman was 109 min.  With this project, we have demonstrated that low follow-up rates can be substantially improved by the implementation of a more personal and culturally tailored approach, coupled with utilization of state-of-the-art computer assistance.  This supplement addresses the need for dissemination of cost-effective interventions that improve Pap smear follow-up in high-risk populations.  We propose a strategy for dissemination and maintenance of the intervention on a local-scale.  If successful, we will adapt the intervention, based on what we have learned, for more widespread dissemination.

"Folate, Smoking, Race and Cervical Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nutrition, environment, and race are implicated in the etiology of several cancers. This study will assess the interrelationships of these three factors in cervical cancer, by examining the interaction of folate, smoking, and race. Smoking is an established risk factor for cervical cancer, but poor study designs, small sample sizes, and inadequate folate measurements have interfered with assessment of folate as a cervical cancer risk factor. Smoking has been associated with lower blood levels of folate, but we know of no study designed to test if the interaction between smoking and folate is associated with cancer. Many smoking-related cancers have disproportionately high mortality and incidence rates for black Americans. However, the interaction of nutrition with smoking has been relatively unexplored as a contributor to this racial disparity. By improving study design, increasing sample size, utilizing dietary folate equivalents (DFEs) and homocysteine levels (a functional marker of folate sufficiency) in assessing these inter-relationships, and sub-group analysis by race, our study will make a significant addition to the current body of knowledge. At three colposcopy clinics, 1500 women (50 percent black and 50 percent white race) will fill out a questionnaire on frequency of foods eaten, smoke exposure and other factors affecting folate levels and cervical cancer. Each woman will have blood drawn and cervical testing for 13 oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types. Only women testing positive for these HPV types will be kept in the study. Women with cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasms 2 or 3 (CIN 2 or 3) on biopsies will be classified as ""high risk"". All other oncogenic HPV positive women (with normal or CIN I biopsies) will be classified as ""low risk"". Plasma will be tested for homocysteine. The interaction between folate (dietary intake or plasma homocysteine) and smoking associated with increased cervical cancer risk will be analyzed using ordinal logistic or logistic regression, including analysis by race. Cervical cancer has a step-wise histologic progression (which allows ordinal analysis or increase in the number of ""cases"" collected in a short time period). It is one of the few cancers with a known necessary, though not sufficient, cause - HPV. By limiting analyses to women with HPV exposure, this study insures that all women have an equal chance of their smoking and folate exposure affecting whether they acquire the disease. This study may be the first cancer study to utilize DFEs, which reflect dietary folate bioavailability and are more likely to be associated with cancer risk than crude folate intake. Our study will be among the first to analyze the interaction of DFEs (or homocysteine) and cigarette associated with cancer. This study will have implications for smoking cessation, cancer prevention, folate supplementation and duration between Papanicolaou (Pap) smears. It may also explain some of the racial disparity in cervical cancer and possibly other smoking-related cancers.

"Enhanced Single-Visit Cervical Cancer Screening Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): An innovative approach to screen women for cervix cancer and provide early treatment for severe cervix dysplasia in a single-visit program (SVP) is ongoing in a Latino/Hispanic community as part of the current Single-Visit Cervical Cancer Prevention Program application (7/1/98-6/30/03).  This continuation application is designed to further increase the effectiveness of the single-visit program (SVP).  The first aim is to implement and evaluate a process to identify women in local Latino/Hispanic communities who have oncogenic type human Papilloma virus (HPV) infections, known precursors for cervix dysplasia and cervical cancer, and recruit them for the SVP.  Health disparities exist in the incidence of cervical cancer among racial/ethnic groups with Hispanic women (Latinas) among the groups experiencing higher rates. Screening procedures to identify Latinas with oncogenic type HPV infections may contribute to identification of women at most risk for cervix cancer. HPV self-sampling in the home, as proposed in this study, has not been tested. The process will involve the distribution of HPV Home Self-administered Sample Collection (HSASC) kits to 4000 Latinas. Recruitment will continue until a minimum of 1840 self-samples has been returned, of which 9.14% (N=168) are expected to be HPV-positive. Latinas with HPV-positive self-samples will be invited to come to one of two clinics offering the SVP. A 60% response rate (N=135) is expected. Additionally, twice as many women with HPV-negative samples matched by age and recruitment method will be invited to participate (N=270).  Sensitivity and specificity analysis will be done using samples obtained by a provider during the subsequent clinic visit as the reference. Satisfaction with self-sampling compared to provider sampling will be evaluated. An increase of approximately 60% is estimated in the proportion of women with severe cervix dysplasia who enter the SVP. The second aim is to evaluate the impact of Promotoras on the recruitment of Latinas in the clinical trial. Two recruitment and HSASC kit distribution methods will be used: media-based ad campaign with mail distribution and Promotora distribution. Promotoras will recruit 3,200 Latinas to receive HSASC kits with an estimated self-sample return rate of 50% (1,600 self-samples).  The media-based ad campaign will be used to recruit another 800 Latinas who will receive the HSASC kit in the mail.  A 30% (N=240) self-sample return rate is expected.  Comparisons of return rates and satisfaction with recruitment and distribution method will be tested.  The third aim is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the HSASC program and HPV testing as an adjunct to the SVP program.  Cost-effectiveness analysis will be used to measure the ratio of program dollar net costs or cost savings to program effectiveness, which are the non-dollar net program outcomes.  The incremental net cost associated with an incremental improvement in outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) will be measured.         ",Enhanced Single-Visit Cervical Cancer Screening Program,6614379,R01CA076502,"['cytology ', ' mass screening ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' mass information media ', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis ', ' cervix neoplasm ', ' cancer prevention ', ' preneoplastic state ', ' health behavior ', ' female ', ' Hispanic American ', ' culture ', ' human papillomavirus ', "" women's health "", ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' self examination ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2003,474582,0.19442783624415663
"Reducing Cervical Cancer in Appalachia    In response to RFA ES-02-009, a multi-disciplinary group of investigators from the Ohio State University and the University of Michigan have collaborated to propose a Center for Population Health and Health Disparities focusing on an important health issue in underserved populations,cancer. The Center will initially focus on the goal of understanding why high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are observed in Appalachia Ohio, a mainly rural area in Southern and Eastern Ohio. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research within the framework of the Social Determinants of Health model in three inter-related projects and four supporting cores. All studies will be conducted in 16 clinics which represent the general population of women aged 18 and older in the region. We will utilize the Center's internal and external advisory committees and community partners organized into a community advisory board and Consortium of communityorganizations to facilitate the accomplishment of project goals. Project 1 will recruit 1600 women to an observational study to  investigate multi-level (social, environmental, behavioral, and biological) correlates of ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization, in Phase I. From this cohort of women, those who smoke (30%) will be eligible to participate in Project 2, which tests the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote smoking cessation (behavioral) and validate cessation endpoints with saliva cotinine measurements (biological) in a quasi-experimental trial design; those women who are in need of & Pap test (48% of 1600) will be eligible to participate in Phase II of Project 1 which will test the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization (behavioral) and follow-up for abnormalities (biological) detected in a quasi-experimental trial design. Project 3 will examine the contribution of HPV (biological) to cervical abnormalities in Appalachia in relation to individual-level behaviors (e.g. smoking, sexual activity) within the social and environmental region of Appalachia in a case-control observational study among women who have Pap smears in these 16 clinics.The research will be supported by four cores: A) Administration - fiscal and Center oversight; B) Biostatistics and Data Resources - sample selection, data management, data analysis, and population data resources; C) Clinical Correlative Sciences - collect, obtain and process biomarker specimens; and D) Behavioral Assessment and Intervention - train interviewers and lay health educators, conduct interviews, design intervention material, and facilitate  communication amongst sites.

"Digital Multimedia Cervical Cancer Kiosks for Latinas DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although cervical cancer mortality rates declined by approximately 1.8 percent annually in the past decade among women in the U.S., the mortality rate for Latinas increased during this time period at a rate of 0.2 percent per year. The long-term goal of this study is to develop a cervical cancer education intervention for low-income, low literacy Latinas to address this health disparity. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) develop culturally and linguistically appropriate cervical cancer screening messages, (2) develop interactive, multimedia kiosks to deliver the education intervention, (3) evaluate the efficacy of the intervention to promote Pap screening, and (4) evaluate the acceptance of the interactive, multimedia kiosks by the target population.       The multimedia kiosks will integrate emerging technologies to create next-generation digital kiosks that deliver stunning full-motion video with crisp digital images and sound in compact, mobile, reliable and cost-accessible units. Interactive multimedia digital kiosks have great potential as a cancer education platform in the $931 million health education media market. These kiosks can reach multiple population groups with a single product through custom-tailored messages at a significant price point.       The study employs a randomized, pre-test and post-test, control-group experimental design. A total of 900 low-income Latinas will be accrued at one rural and two urban community clinics in California. Study participants will be randomly assigned to either an experimental or control condition in equal numbers after they are administered a pre-test. The experimental group will be exposed to a multimedia cervical cancer education intervention while the control group will receive a cervical cancer brochure, which represents standard care for cervical cancer education. Six-months from baseline, a post-test will be administered to both treatment and control groups. These data will be analyzed using chi-square tests to compare the study arms to determine behavioral and attitudinal outcomes, as well as change in self-efficacy and decisional balance. Multivariate models will be used to examine covariates of the intervention effect.

"Telecolposcopy in a Primary Care Women's Health Clinic DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Telemedicine services are rapidly becoming an integral part of many hospitals and rural clinics around the world and are perceived as having great potential for accessing underserved populations. Although the mortality from invasive cervical cancer in the US has declined over 50% during the past 40 years, likely due to aggressive screening programs, the decrease has not been as dramatic among minority populations and rurally located populations. The Arizona- Sonora Binational Commission has identified cervical cancer prevention as a high priority for Hispanic women. Since the majority of patients with frank cervical carcinoma and cervical dysplasia, its precursor lesion, are asymptomatic, Pap smear screening provides the best approach to early detection. Patients with an abnormal Pap smear and no visible lesion on visual cervical inspection are referred to colposcopy. The colposcope is a magnifying instrument that can directly detect dysplastic lesions of the cervix. Once visualized, the lesion can be biopsied and a tissue diagnosis can be made. Telecolposcopy allows for the collection and transmission of digital cervical images via telecommunications technology. Telecolposcopy can be performed live, in ""real-time,"" with direct communication between the colposcopist and the telecolposcopist, or the telecolposcopist can review the images at a later time via store-forward technology. The use of telecolposcopy provides a means for rural women to access this specialized care without being burdened by usual constraints includingtravel, time off from work due to travel and costs due to travel such as arrangements for child and elder care. Pilot data from a university tertiary care colposcopy clinic demonstrate that the efficacy of telecolposcopy is comparable to that of colposcopy. This study will build on the pilotdata by examining the feasibility of telecolposcopy outside of a tertiary care setting. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that telecolposcopy will be as clinically effective as in.person colposcopy in the assessment of the cervix after an abnormal Pap smear.

"Folate, Smoking, Race and Cervical Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nutrition, environment, and race are implicated in the etiology of several cancers. This study will assess the interrelationships of these three factors in cervical cancer, by examining the interaction of folate, smoking, and race. Smoking is an established risk factor for cervical cancer, but poor study designs, small sample sizes, and inadequate folate measurements have interfered with assessment of folate as a cervical cancer risk factor. Smoking has been associated with lower blood levels of folate, but we know of no study designed to test if the interaction between smoking and folate is associated with cancer. Many smoking-related cancers have disproportionately high mortality and incidence rates for black Americans. However, the interaction of nutrition with smoking has been relatively unexplored as a contributor to this racial disparity. By improving study design, increasing sample size, utilizing dietary folate equivalents (DFEs) and homocysteine levels (a functional marker of folate sufficiency) in assessing these inter-relationships, and sub-group analysis by race, our study will make a significant addition to the current body of knowledge. At three colposcopy clinics, 1500 women (50 percent black and 50 percent white race) will fill out a questionnaire on frequency of foods eaten, smoke exposure and other factors affecting folate levels and cervical cancer. Each woman will have blood drawn and cervical testing for 13 oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types. Only women testing positive for these HPV types will be kept in the study. Women with cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasms 2 or 3 (CIN 2 or 3) on biopsies will be classified as ""high risk"". All other oncogenic HPV positive women (with normal or CIN I biopsies) will be classified as ""low risk"". Plasma will be tested for homocysteine. The interaction between folate (dietary intake or plasma homocysteine) and smoking associated with increased cervical cancer risk will be analyzed using ordinal logistic or logistic regression, including analysis by race. Cervical cancer has a step-wise histologic progression (which allows ordinal analysis or increase in the number of ""cases"" collected in a short time period). It is one of the few cancers with a known necessary, though not sufficient, cause - HPV. By limiting analyses to women with HPV exposure, this study insures that all women have an equal chance of their smoking and folate exposure affecting whether they acquire the disease. This study may be the first cancer study to utilize DFEs, which reflect dietary folate bioavailability and are more likely to be associated with cancer risk than crude folate intake. Our study will be among the first to analyze the interaction of DFEs (or homocysteine) and cigarette associated with cancer. This study will have implications for smoking cessation, cancer prevention, folate supplementation and duration between Papanicolaou (Pap) smears. It may also explain some of the racial disparity in cervical cancer and possibly other smoking-related cancers.

"Facilitating Follow-up Adherence for Abnormal Pap Smears DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the overall decline in cervical cancer, there is a large disparity between disease-related incidence and mortality rates for African Americans (AA) and Latinas compared to Caucasians. Adherence to diagnostic colposcopy and follow-up regimens is crucial after an abnormal Pap smear result indicative of oncogenic HPV (approximately 75 percent of abnormalities), since early detection and medical management can prevent invasive cervical cancer. However, rates of adherence to initial diagnostic colposcopy and subsequent medical recommendations remain low among low-income minority populations. Hence, there is a need to develop and evaluate the efficacy of culturally- sensitive, transportable health communication protocols to facilitate adherence over time. Guided by the Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP) model, this randomized controlled trial aims to conduct a head-to-head comparison of a tailored counseling intervention protocol, delivered through either telephone or mail-home print, designed to assess and address cognitive- affective barriers to adherence among low-income AAs and Latinas prior to the initial diagnostic colposcopy appointment. Patients (N=730) will receive a barriers assessment and will be randomly assigned to: 1) standard care (SC; notification letter plus telephone appointment confirmation); 2) telephone barriers counseling (CAB-T; SC plus tailored Cognitive-Affective Barriers Counseling delivered by phone); or 3) print barriers counseling (CAB-P; SC plus tailored Cognitive-Affective Barriers Print materials delivered via mail). Additional aims are to explore the cognitive-affective mediators of intervention impact and the moderating role of attentional style on the individual's cognitive-affective processing profile. Outcome measures will assess adherence to initial colposcopy and to follow-up management recommendations over the 15-month cervical surveillance cycle, cognitive-affective processes (risk-related knowledge/perceptions, fatalism, motivation to adhere, intrusive/avoidant ideation, health-related planning) and intervention cost-effectiveness. Psychosocial assessments will be conducted by telephone at baseline (2-4 weeks pre-colposcopy), and at 1-week, 9-months, and 15-months post-index colposcopy. A dissemination plan will be developed from study outcomes data, the cost-effectiveness analysis, patient intervention evaluations, and input from a Community Advisory Committee and on-site staff. The study brings together two key strengths, expertise in: 1) cervical cancer risk assessment; and 2) the design and analysis of transportable tailored counseling protocols targeted to underserved at-risk groups. Findings are relevant not only to the management of precancerous cervical disease, but will also lay the groundwork for counseling protocols that can be readily disseminated into routine care to increase adherence to medical regimens, with a view to ultimately reducing the disparity in disease rates among underserved populations.

"Breaast and Cervical Cancer Screening in Obese Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate's long-term career goal is to understand how primary medical care impacts cancer outcomes and to develop interventions that will improve primary medical care in this regard.  Primary medical care is important in helping to decrease cancer incidence and mortality and to understand the causes of health disparities in cancer stage and survival.  UMDNJ- New Jersey Medical School, located in Newark, New Jersey is surrounded by a community affected by heavier burdens of cancer incidence, late stage cancer at diagnosis, and cancer mortality.  The adjacent counties surrounding the school contain 27.3 % of New Jersey's total population, but 52.4% of its African-American population and 49.7% of the state's Hispanic population.  This population is ideal for studying the causes of late stage cancer diagnosis and racial disparities in cancer stage and survival.  In collaboration with the Cancer Institute of New Jersey, the institution is developing, as a top priority, research and clinical programs to address deficits in cancer care in northern New Jersey and major health disparities evident in Newark and its environs.  The PI's career objectives of this proposal are to increase quantitative skills in data analysis, to refine skills in survey research, to learn qualitative research methods, and to learn how to integrate culture, language, and literacy into cancer control interventions.  The research career development plan includes: completion of a Masters in Public Health degree program, the NCI's ""Principles and Practice of Cancer Prevention and Control Course,"" a review course on SAS statistical software, a training course on SUDAAN Statistical Software, completion of the Cancer, Culture, and Literacy Institute, various other cancer and research forums, and the conduct of mentored multi-method research.      This multi-method research project will focus on breast and cervical cancer screening in an at risk subpopulation: obese women.  Obese women are more likely than nonobese women to be delayed in breast and cervical cancer screening.  Since African-American and Hispanic women are disproportionately obese compared to other races, this study may impact racial disparities in cancer.  First, new analyses will be conducted using data from the National Health Interview Survey to quantify the extent of the association of obesity to delayed cancer screening, and the impact of race/ethnicity and comorbidity on this association.  Next, focus groups will be conducted with obese women to identify their barriers to cancer screening.  In addition, in-depth interviews and a mail survey will be administered to physicians to identify their barriers to cancer screening in obese women and to elicit suggestions to overcome those barriers.  Finally, an interventional plan and materials will be developed that are appropriate for a multicultural target group and evaluated for appropriateness, readability, and feasibility through focus groups of patients and physicians.

"Enhanced Single-Visit Cervical Cancer Screening Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): An innovative approach to screen women for cervix cancer and provide early treatment for severe cervix dysplasia in a single-visit program (SVP) is ongoing in a Latino/Hispanic community as part of the current Single-Visit Cervical Cancer Prevention Program application (7/1/98-6/30/03).  This continuation application is designed to further increase the effectiveness of the single-visit program (SVP).  The first aim is to implement and evaluate a process to identify women in local Latino/Hispanic communities who have oncogenic type human Papilloma virus (HPV) infections, known precursors for cervix dysplasia and cervical cancer, and recruit them for the SVP.  Health disparities exist in the incidence of cervical cancer among racial/ethnic groups with Hispanic women (Latinas) among the groups experiencing higher rates. Screening procedures to identify Latinas with oncogenic type HPV infections may contribute to identification of women at most risk for cervix cancer. HPV self-sampling in the home, as proposed in this study, has not been tested. The process will involve the distribution of HPV Home Self-administered Sample Collection (HSASC) kits to 4000 Latinas. Recruitment will continue until a minimum of 1840 self-samples has been returned, of which 9.14% (N=168) are expected to be HPV-positive. Latinas with HPV-positive self-samples will be invited to come to one of two clinics offering the SVP. A 60% response rate (N=135) is expected. Additionally, twice as many women with HPV-negative samples matched by age and recruitment method will be invited to participate (N=270).  Sensitivity and specificity analysis will be done using samples obtained by a provider during the subsequent clinic visit as the reference. Satisfaction with self-sampling compared to provider sampling will be evaluated. An increase of approximately 60% is estimated in the proportion of women with severe cervix dysplasia who enter the SVP. The second aim is to evaluate the impact of Promotoras on the recruitment of Latinas in the clinical trial. Two recruitment and HSASC kit distribution methods will be used: media-based ad campaign with mail distribution and Promotora distribution. Promotoras will recruit 3,200 Latinas to receive HSASC kits with an estimated self-sample return rate of 50% (1,600 self-samples).  The media-based ad campaign will be used to recruit another 800 Latinas who will receive the HSASC kit in the mail.  A 30% (N=240) self-sample return rate is expected.  Comparisons of return rates and satisfaction with recruitment and distribution method will be tested.  The third aim is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the HSASC program and HPV testing as an adjunct to the SVP program.  Cost-effectiveness analysis will be used to measure the ratio of program dollar net costs or cost savings to program effectiveness, which are the non-dollar net program outcomes.  The incremental net cost associated with an incremental improvement in outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) will be measured.         ",Enhanced Single-Visit Cervical Cancer Screening Program,6915554,R01CA076502,"['cytology ', ' mass screening ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' mass information media ', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis ', ' cervix neoplasm ', ' cancer prevention ', ' preneoplastic state ', ' health behavior ', ' female ', ' Hispanic American ', ' culture ', ' human papillomavirus ', "" women's health "", ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' self examination ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2005,518201,0.19442783624415663
"""Patient Navigation in the SafetyNet: CONNECTeDD""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Despite advances in early detection and treatment options, racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status women continue to suffer advanced stage at diagnosis and higher mortality for both breast and cervical cancer. Delays in diagnosis and treatment, which contribute to poorer outcomes, have been associated with well known barriers to care. These disparities persist despite this knowledge represents a gap between discovery and delivery of cancer care resulting in a pressing need for effective interventions.   The objective of this study is to design, implement and evaluate a patient navigator intervention at six community health centers in Boston, Massachusetts. These sites represents a wide range of racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status women served by an urban safety net institution that mirrors the infrastructure of this country's urban health systems. The intervention is a model based on Andersen's Model of Health Services Use. Aided by an Electronic Medical Record tracking system and theory based cultural competency training, patient navigators will: identify cases, provide service coordination and direct patient support.   Our specific aims are to determine if the intervention will:   1. Reduce time to diagnosis (or resolution of abnormality) after an abnormal mammogram or Pap smear; 2. Reduce time to complete treatment and provide higher quality treatment after a cancer diagnosis; 3. Improve patient satisfaction with health care services; 4. Have critical components (time with patient vs. time coordinating care) which drive its success; 5. Result in more cost-effective care.   We will use a quasi-experimental design with block randomization of six community health centers whose primary affiliation is with Boston Medical Center. Each site will be randomly assigned to either Breast or Cervical Patient Navigation. Thus, each of the Breast intervention sites will serve as a continuous comparison site for the Cervical intervention sites and vice versa.   We expect that the results of this study will inform the design of a generalizable standard, effective and cost efficient patient navigation model that will eliminate barriers to timely, quality cancer care among racial/ethnic minority and lower income populations         ","""Patient Navigation in the SafetyNet: CONNECTeDD""",6986613,U01CA116892,[''],NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2005,637203,0.045219341004168245
"Reducing Cervical Cancer in Appalachia    In response to RFA ES-02-009, a multi-disciplinary group of investigators from the Ohio State University and the University of Michigan have collaborated to propose a Center for Population Health and Health Disparities focusing on an important health issue in underserved populations,cancer. The Center will initially focus on the goal of understanding why high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are observed in Appalachia Ohio, a mainly rural area in Southern and Eastern Ohio. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research within the framework of the Social Determinants of Health model in three inter-related projects and four supporting cores. All studies will be conducted in 16 clinics which represent the general population of women aged 18 and older in the region. We will utilize the Center's internal and external advisory committees and community partners organized into a community advisory board and Consortium of communityorganizations to facilitate the accomplishment of project goals. Project 1 will recruit 1600 women to an observational study to  investigate multi-level (social, environmental, behavioral, and biological) correlates of ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization, in Phase I. From this cohort of women, those who smoke (30%) will be eligible to participate in Project 2, which tests the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote smoking cessation (behavioral) and validate cessation endpoints with saliva cotinine measurements (biological) in a quasi-experimental trial design; those women who are in need of & Pap test (48% of 1600) will be eligible to participate in Phase II of Project 1 which will test the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization (behavioral) and follow-up for abnormalities (biological) detected in a quasi-experimental trial design. Project 3 will examine the contribution of HPV (biological) to cervical abnormalities in Appalachia in relation to individual-level behaviors (e.g. smoking, sexual activity) within the social and environmental region of Appalachia in a case-control observational study among women who have Pap smears in these 16 clinics.The research will be supported by four cores: A) Administration - fiscal and Center oversight; B) Biostatistics and Data Resources - sample selection, data management, data analysis, and population data resources; C) Clinical Correlative Sciences - collect, obtain and process biomarker specimens; and D) Behavioral Assessment and Intervention - train interviewers and lay health educators, conduct interviews, design intervention material, and facilitate  communication amongst sites. The Center includes a mechanism for pilot project solicitation, review and funding. This Center has institutional commitment in terms of personnel, funds and space, as well as, a commitment to focus on the problem of health disparities in the region. Finally, members of the team have worked together in the past in various settings that focus on the goals of the proposed Center and have an established relationship in Appalachian Ohio for the purpose of improving the health of the population.

"Digital Multimedia Cervical Cancer Kiosks for Latinas DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although cervical cancer mortality rates declined by approximately 1.8 percent annually in the past decade among women in the U.S., the mortality rate for Latinas increased during this time period at a rate of 0.2 percent per year. The long-term goal of this study is to develop a cervical cancer education intervention for low-income, low literacy Latinas to address this health disparity. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) develop culturally and linguistically appropriate cervical cancer screening messages, (2) develop interactive, multimedia kiosks to deliver the education intervention, (3) evaluate the efficacy of the intervention to promote Pap screening, and (4) evaluate the acceptance of the interactive, multimedia kiosks by the target population.       The multimedia kiosks will integrate emerging technologies to create next-generation digital kiosks that deliver stunning full-motion video with crisp digital images and sound in compact, mobile, reliable and cost-accessible units. Interactive multimedia digital kiosks have great potential as a cancer education platform in the $931 million health education media market. These kiosks can reach multiple population groups with a single product through custom-tailored messages at a significant price point.       The study employs a randomized, pre-test and post-test, control-group experimental design. A total of 900 low-income Latinas will be accrued at one rural and two urban community clinics in California. Study participants will be randomly assigned to either an experimental or control condition in equal numbers after they are administered a pre-test. The experimental group will be exposed to a multimedia cervical cancer education intervention while the control group will receive a cervical cancer brochure, which represents standard care for cervical cancer education. Six-months from baseline, a post-test will be administered to both treatment and control groups. These data will be analyzed using chi-square tests to compare the study arms to determine behavioral and attitudinal outcomes, as well as change in self-efficacy and decisional balance.

"Understand Disparities in Cervical Cancer Survival DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer is an entirely preventable disease yet in Texas approximately 1200 women are newly diagnosed and 300 die with this disease per year. Several recent studies suggest that poverty not minority ethnicity may be an important predictor of poor survival particularly for those diagnosed at an early stage. The purpose of this project is to explore disparities in cervical cancer stage at diagnosis, treatment and survival in Texas, a large state with great ethnic, income, and rural / urban diversity. We propose a population-based cohort study of all women diagnosed with cervical cancer and reported to the Texas Cancer Registry (TCR) between 1995-2002 (N>8800 women). Specific Aims are (1) To determine whether women of minority race or ethnicity (Asian, Hispanic, and African-American relative to White), those with lower income or education, and those living in more rural regions among women diagnosed with CxCa are more likely to die or have shorter survival, stratified by tumor stage. (2) To determine to what extent the differences in survival experienced by women of diverse ethnicity, income, or rurality can be explained by their treatment received, tumor stage at diagnosis or comorbid conditions. We plan to use (a) geocoded data to allow a more precise census tract level measures of socio-economic status and (b) multiple sources of cancer treatment data (Texas Medicaid, Medicare, and Hospital Discharge merged with TCR cancer and mortality data). A conceptual model is proposed to assess the role of disparities in (1) cervical cancer surivival, (2) intermediate outcomes (late stage at diagnosis and suboptimal treatment), and (3) comorbid conditions. Multilevel logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling are planned to estimate the risk of mortality and survival time, respectively. This R21 will provide pre-intervention data to identify those disparities indicators which should be the target of aggressive individual and health care provider level interventions to identify cervical cancer early and get women needed effective treatment in a timely manner.

"Cervical Cancer Control in Vietnamese Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vietnamese American women have higher rates of invasive cervical cancer than any other racial/ethnic group (43 per 100,000 compared to 8 per 100,000 among non-Latina white women). Further, approximately 25% of Vietnamese women have never received a Pap smear (compared to 5% of non-Latina white women). The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Panel on cervical cancer has recommended that funding priorities should include research focusing on racial/ethnic minority populations and women who have never had a Pap smear.   We have previously developed a culturally and linguistically appropriate cervical cancer control outreach intervention for Vietnamese women, and documented its acceptability and feasibility in terms of program delivery. Our primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of our outreach intervention in increasing the uptake of Pap testing among never screened Vietnamese women. Secondary objectives are as follows: to examine the effectiveness of the intervention in improving knowledge about cervical cancer and Pap testing; to document the costs of the program; and to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.  A randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Trial participants will include 250 Vietnamese American women, aged 20-79 years, who have never been screened for cervical cancer. These women will be identified from a community-based survey of 1,000 Vietnamese households. Participants will be individually randomized to intervention or control status. Bilingual, bicultural Vietnamese women will deliver the cervical cancer control outreach intervention to women in the intervention arm. The intervention will include home visits, follow-up telephone calls, use of a video and pamphlet, and tailored counseling and logistic assistance.

"Telecolposcopy in a Primary Care Women's Health Clinic DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Telemedicine services are rapidly becoming an integral part of many hospitals and rural clinics around the world and are perceived as having great potential for accessing underserved populations. Although the mortality from invasive cervical cancer in the US has declined over 50% during the past 40 years, likely due to aggressive screening programs, the decrease has not been as dramatic among minority populations and rurally located populations. The Arizona- Sonora Binational Commission has identified cervical cancer prevention as a high priority for Hispanic women. Since the majority of patients with frank cervical carcinoma and cervical dysplasia, its precursor lesion, are asymptomatic, Pap smear screening provides the best approach to early detection. Patients with an abnormal Pap smear and no visible lesion on visual cervical inspection are referred to colposcopy. The colposcope is a magnifying instrument that can directly detect dysplastic lesions of the cervix. Once visualized, the lesion can be biopsied and a tissue diagnosis can be made. Telecolposcopy allows for the collection and transmission of digital cervical images via telecommunications technology. Telecolposcopy can be performed live, in ""real-time,"" with direct communication between the colposcopist and the telecolposcopist, or the telecolposcopist can review the images at a later time via store-forward technology. The use of telecolposcopy provides a means for rural women to access this specialized care without being burdened by usual constraints includingtravel, time off from work due to travel and costs due to travel such as arrangements for child and elder care. Pilot data from a university tertiary care colposcopy clinic demonstrate that the efficacy of telecolposcopy is comparable to that of colposcopy. This study will build on the pilotdata by examining the feasibility of telecolposcopy outside of a tertiary care setting. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that telecolposcopy will be as clinically effective as in.person colposcopy in the assessment of the cervix after an abnormal Pap smear. The secondary hypotheses are (a) patients, their providers, and the telecolposcopists will be satisfied with telecolposcopy services and (b) telecolposcopy can be integrated into a primary care women's health clinical practice in a cost effective manner. The proposed study will result in the improved management of cervical lesions for women with decreased access to telecolposcopy services.

"Facilitating Follow-up Adherence for Abnormal Pap Smears DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the overall decline in cervical cancer, there is a large disparity between disease-related incidence and mortality rates for African Americans (AA) and Latinas compared to Caucasians. Adherence to diagnostic colposcopy and follow-up regimens is crucial after an abnormal Pap smear result indicative of oncogenic HPV (approximately 75 percent of abnormalities), since early detection and medical management can prevent invasive cervical cancer. However, rates of adherence to initial diagnostic colposcopy and subsequent medical recommendations remain low among low-income minority populations. Hence, there is a need to develop and evaluate the efficacy of culturally- sensitive, transportable health communication protocols to facilitate adherence over time. Guided by the Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP) model, this randomized controlled trial aims to conduct a head-to-head comparison of a tailored counseling intervention protocol, delivered through either telephone or mail-home print, designed to assess and address cognitive- affective barriers to adherence among low-income AAs and Latinas prior to the initial diagnostic colposcopy appointment. Patients (N=730) will receive a barriers assessment and will be randomly assigned to: 1) standard care (SC; notification letter plus telephone appointment confirmation); 2) telephone barriers counseling (CAB-T; SC plus tailored Cognitive-Affective Barriers Counseling delivered by phone); or 3) print barriers counseling (CAB-P; SC plus tailored Cognitive-Affective Barriers Print materials delivered via mail). Additional aims are to explore the cognitive-affective mediators of intervention impact and the moderating role of attentional style on the individual's cognitive-affective processing profile. Outcome measures will assess adherence to initial colposcopy and to follow-up management recommendations over the 15-month cervical surveillance cycle, cognitive-affective processes (risk-related knowledge/perceptions, fatalism, motivation to adhere, intrusive/avoidant ideation, health-related planning) and intervention cost-effectiveness. Psychosocial assessments will be conducted by telephone at baseline (2-4 weeks pre-colposcopy), and at 1-week, 9-months, and 15-months post-index colposcopy. A dissemination plan will be developed from study outcomes data, the cost-effectiveness analysis, patient intervention evaluations, and input from a Community Advisory Committee and on-site staff. The study brings together two key strengths, expertise in: 1) cervical cancer risk assessment; and 2) the design and analysis of transportable tailored counseling protocols targeted to underserved at-risk groups. Findings are relevant not only to the management of precancerous cervical disease, but will also lay the groundwork for counseling protocols that can be readily disseminated into routine care to increase adherence to medical regimens, with a view to ultimately reducing the disparity in disease rates among underserved populations.

"Community Intervention to Increase Carvical Cancer Screening-Chinese Amer Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chinese Americans comprise the largest group among the U.S. Asian population. Census 2000 data indicate that nearly three quarters of a million of the total U.S. Chinese population of 2.5 million reside in the Northeastern corridor of the country. A large subset of this group is comprised of recent immigrants. Demographic trends and distinctive characteristics of this group underscore the importance of addressing the group's needs and the design and implementation of specially adapted intervention strategies to meet their needs. Cervical cancer represents a serious health issue among Chinese women. Recent studies indicated that Chinese women are less aware of cervical cancer risk factors and showed that, in addition to a higher incidence of the disease, they experience worse survival rates post diagnosis of early stage cervical carcinoma than non-Asian groups. Although use of the of the Papanicolaou (Pap) test has placed cervical cancer in the range of most preventable cancers and has effected a dramatic drop in cervical cancer diagnoses in the general US population, disparities in incidence and mortality of this disease remain among certain minority groups, including Chinese women, where Pap test utilization rates have remained low. This study proposes to develop a culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate intervention program for underserved and mostly uninsured Chinese women to increase their knowledge, change their attitudes and improve their cervical cancer screening rate. The study will also identify health system access barriers and form the basis for developing a future viable navigation program. The study will use two-group quasi-experimental design, with pre- and post-intervention tests and a 6-month follow up telephone call. Participants in New York City (n=100), age 40 and above, will be assigned to intervention or comparison group. The intervention group will participate in a comprehensive educational intervention program designed to increase knowledge about and attitudes regarding cervical cancer, and provided navigation assistance (appointments, language, etc.), and will participate in an open discussion with Chinese-speaking physician and community health educators. Handouts on cervical cancer and Pap test and a video, in Chinese, will also be made available to the intervention group. The control group will be provided with small group education and materials on general cancer prevention and early detection, and encouraged to visit their health providers for screening. The pilot study aims represent an extension of our NCI-funded parent CNP grant, ATECAR-Asian Community Cancer Network. The study is directly related to ATECAR goals of reducing the incidence and risk behaviors of cancer among Asian Americans, stimulating partners' participation in and increasing research and training opportunities for Asian junior investigators in cancer interventions. Findings of the study, especially on patient navigation, will lay the groundwork for a full-scale randomized intervention trial of a culturally tailored cervical cancer intervention, focused on Chinese American women.           ",Community Intervention to Increase Carvical Cancer Screening-Chinese Amer Women,7226539,U01CA114582,[''],NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,U01,2006,63499,0.1696098497593698
"Disparities in Cancer Prevention and Control    DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT):  The purpose of this project is to extend our current work on the development of decision-analytic policy models in cancer to quantify the impact of disparities in screening, follow-up, and treatment in terms of its impact on cancer-related outcomes. We will initially develop a generalizable model that will serve as a framework for incorporating disparities in decision-analytic models. We will focus on disparities in cancer risk, cancer screening participation rates, treatment patterns, and their interactions. We will evaluate several hypothetical situations to highlight those areas where disparities are most concerning. In addition, we will leverage the work that we have already done to develop cohort-specific simulation models to address socially relevant policy questions that disproportionately affect certain segments of the population.  We will conduct analyses for questions pertaining to three major cancers: colorectal, cervical and breast.  The models will be evaluated as Monte Carlo simulations (one person at a time), which provide a substantial amount of flexibility in terms of keeping track of person-specific variables. The colorectal cancer and cervical cancer models simulate the evolution from a normal cervix or normal colonic epithelium to precancerous lesions (i.e., adenomatous polyps for the former model, cervical lesions for the latter) to malignancy. Cancer diagnosis occurs when a screening test is applied to a person with undiagnosed malignancy (based on the test sensitivity), or if symptoms occur that lead to a correct diagnosis (symptom-diagnosed cancer). Once a cancer is detected and staged, details of specific treatment strategies can be incorporated that affect cancer-specific mortality. The cancer-specific models will be used to analyze the effects of important contributors to disparities and how they relate to cancer control.          ",Disparities in Cancer Prevention and Control,7149001,R01HS015570,"['computer simulation ', ' mass screening ', ' health care model ', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis ', ' colorectal neoplasm ', ' breast neoplasm ', ' cervix neoplasm ', ' cancer prevention ', ' neoplasm /cancer therapy ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' human data ', "" women's health "", ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",AHRQ,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2006,12211,0.0730743128905376
"Reducing Cervical Cancer in Appalachia    In response to RFA ES-02-009, a multi-disciplinary group of investigators from the Ohio State University and the University of Michigan have collaborated to propose a Center for Population Health and Health Disparities focusing on an important health issue in underserved populations,cancer. The Center will initially focus on the goal of understanding why high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are observed in Appalachia Ohio, a mainly rural area in Southern and Eastern Ohio. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research within the framework of the Social Determinants of Health model in three inter-related projects and four supporting cores. All studies will be conducted in 16 clinics which represent the general population of women aged 18 and older in the region. We will utilize the Center's internal and external advisory committees and community partners organized into a community advisory board and Consortium of communityorganizations to facilitate the accomplishment of project goals. Project 1 will recruit 1600 women to an observational study to  investigate multi-level (social, environmental, behavioral, and biological) correlates of ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization, in Phase I. From this cohort of women, those who smoke (30%) will be eligible to participate in Project 2, which tests the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote smoking cessation (behavioral) and validate cessation endpoints with saliva cotinine measurements (biological) in a quasi-experimental trial design; those women who are in need of & Pap test (48% of 1600) will be eligible to participate in Phase II of Project 1 which will test the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization (behavioral) and follow-up for abnormalities (biological) detected in a quasi-experimental trial design. Project 3 will examine the contribution of HPV (biological) to cervical abnormalities in Appalachia in relation to individual-level behaviors (e.g. smoking, sexual activity) within the social and environmental region of Appalachia in a case-control observational study among women who have Pap smears in these 16 clinics.The research will be supported by four cores: A) Administration - fiscal and Center oversight; B) Biostatistics and Data Resources - sample selection, data management, data analysis, and population data resources; C) Clinical Correlative Sciences - collect, obtain and process biomarker specimens; and D) Behavioral Assessment and Intervention - train interviewers and lay health educators, conduct interviews, design intervention material, and facilitate  communication amongst sites. The Center includes a mechanism for pilot project solicitation, review and funding. This Center has institutional commitment in terms of personnel, funds and space, as well as, a commitment to focus on the problem of health disparities in the region. Finally, members of the team have worked together in the past in various settings that focus on the goals of the proposed Center and have an established relationship in Appalachian Ohio for the purpose of improving the health of the population. Future work of this Center will focus on moving this type of multi-level observational and interventional community-based research, into other areas where health disparities exist in relation to cancer withinour region.

"Enhanced Single-Visit Cervical Cancer Screening Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): An innovative approach to screen women for cervix cancer and provide early treatment for severe cervix dysplasia in a single-visit program (SVP) is ongoing in a Latino/Hispanic community as part of the current Single-Visit Cervical Cancer Prevention Program application (7/1/98-6/30/03).  This continuation application is designed to further increase the effectiveness of the single-visit program (SVP).  The first aim is to implement and evaluate a process to identify women in local Latino/Hispanic communities who have oncogenic type human Papilloma virus (HPV) infections, known precursors for cervix dysplasia and cervical cancer, and recruit them for the SVP.  Health disparities exist in the incidence of cervical cancer among racial/ethnic groups with Hispanic women (Latinas) among the groups experiencing higher rates. Screening procedures to identify Latinas with oncogenic type HPV infections may contribute to identification of women at most risk for cervix cancer. HPV self-sampling in the home, as proposed in this study, has not been tested. The process will involve the distribution of HPV Home Self-administered Sample Collection (HSASC) kits to 4000 Latinas. Recruitment will continue until a minimum of 1840 self-samples has been returned, of which 9.14% (N=168) are expected to be HPV-positive. Latinas with HPV-positive self-samples will be invited to come to one of two clinics offering the SVP. A 60% response rate (N=135) is expected. Additionally, twice as many women with HPV-negative samples matched by age and recruitment method will be invited to participate (N=270).  Sensitivity and specificity analysis will be done using samples obtained by a provider during the subsequent clinic visit as the reference. Satisfaction with self-sampling compared to provider sampling will be evaluated. An increase of approximately 60% is estimated in the proportion of women with severe cervix dysplasia who enter the SVP. The second aim is to evaluate the impact of Promotoras on the recruitment of Latinas in the clinical trial. Two recruitment and HSASC kit distribution methods will be used: media-based ad campaign with mail distribution and Promotora distribution. Promotoras will recruit 3,200 Latinas to receive HSASC kits with an estimated self-sample return rate of 50% (1,600 self-samples).  The media-based ad campaign will be used to recruit another 800 Latinas who will receive the HSASC kit in the mail.  A 30% (N=240) self-sample return rate is expected.  Comparisons of return rates and satisfaction with recruitment and distribution method will be tested.  The third aim is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the HSASC program and HPV testing as an adjunct to the SVP program.  Cost-effectiveness analysis will be used to measure the ratio of program dollar net costs or cost savings to program effectiveness, which are the non-dollar net program outcomes.  The incremental net cost associated with an incremental improvement in outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) will be measured.         ",Enhanced Single-Visit Cervical Cancer Screening Program,7078540,R01CA076502,"['cytology ', ' mass screening ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' mass information media ', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis ', ' cervix neoplasm ', ' cancer prevention ', ' preneoplastic state ', ' health behavior ', ' female ', ' Hispanic American ', ' culture ', ' human papillomavirus ', "" women's health "", ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' self examination ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2006,517669,0.19442783624415663
"Cervical Cancer Control in Vietnamese Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vietnamese American women have higher rates of invasive cervical cancer than any other racial/ethnic group (43 per 100,000 compared to 8 per 100,000 among non-Latina white women). Further, approximately 25% of Vietnamese women have never received a Pap smear (compared to 5% of non-Latina white women). The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Panel on cervical cancer has recommended that funding priorities should include research focusing on racial/ethnic minority populations and women who have never had a Pap smear.   We have previously developed a culturally and linguistically appropriate cervical cancer control outreach intervention for Vietnamese women, and documented its acceptability and feasibility in terms of program delivery. Our primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of our outreach intervention in increasing the uptake of Pap testing among never screened Vietnamese women. Secondary objectives are as follows: to examine the effectiveness of the intervention in improving knowledge about cervical cancer and Pap testing; to document the costs of the program; and to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.  A randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Trial participants will include 250 Vietnamese American women, aged 20-79 years, who have never been screened for cervical cancer. These women will be identified from a community-based survey of 1,000 Vietnamese households. Participants will be individually randomized to intervention or control status. Bilingual, bicultural Vietnamese women will deliver the cervical cancer control outreach intervention to women in the intervention arm. The intervention will include home visits, follow-up telephone calls, use of a video and pamphlet, and tailored counseling and logistic assistance. Outcome evaluation will be based on a follow-up survey as well as medical record verification of self-reported Pap testing.

"SCCDCN: HPV Vaccine Acceptability and Promotion in Faith-Based Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In South Carolina (SC), African-American (AA) women experience excess cervical cancer mortality despite being screened more often that European American women. The reasons for this observation are complex and not well understood. The recent approval of a vaccine for some types of genital HPV infection, a main etiologic factor in the development of cervical disease, has made available a new tool for the prevention of cervical cancer and possible weapon in the fight against cancer disparities. The HPV vaccine is recommended for administration to 11-12 year old females (can be given as early as age 9 and ""catch up"" doses for 13-26 year olds), so adult parents and guardians will often be making the decision to vaccinate their minor daughters. The faith-based setting has been open to other cancer prevention and control and HIV initiatives for AAs in SC, which makes the faith-based setting ideal for exploring HPV vaccine acceptability and opportunities for promotion. To date, HPV vaccine acceptability research has not focused on intervention development in community, non-medical settings. Experts have indicated that the success of the HPV vaccine in terms of reducing cervical cancer mortality is contingent upon exploring the feasibility of promoting and offering the vaccine in non-medical settings (e.g., schools, churches, community centers). The goal of the proposed study is to explore the acceptance of and opportunities for promotion of the HPV vaccine in faith-based settings. The proposed research builds upon research previously conducted in the Pee Dee region, an area with high cervical cancer incidence and mortality. The specific aims for the proposed study are to: (1) Explore HPV vaccine acceptability in a faith-based setting; and (2) Identify opportunities for promoting the HPV vaccine in a faith-based setting. Focus groups (n=10) and in-depth interviews (n=20) will be conducted to address the specific aims. Focus group participants will be females and males (aged 18+) attending one of the participating AA churches. At least two focus groups will be conducted with parents of females in the target age group and at least two with females aged 18-26. In- depth interview participants will be members of church leadership and local community leaders. Data will be analyzed with a Project Advisory Team, including members of the community. All participants will be invited to take part in feedback sessions to review study findings and provide input to help investigators identify opportunities for interventions to increase acceptance, promote informed decision making about the vaccine, and potentially decrease cervical cancer incidence and mortality. A long-term outcome of the pilot project is to develop and test a relevant intervention to implement in faith-based settings.          ",SCCDCN: HPV Vaccine Acceptability and Promotion in Faith-Based Settings,7336720,U01CA114601,"['Daughter ', ' Decision Making ', ' Commit ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Genital Human Papilloma Virus Infection ', ' Genital Human papillomavirus Infection ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Cervical ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' European ', ' male ', ' Minor ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Networks ', ' Parents ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' tool ', ' Baptist Church ', ' Baptists ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Schools ', ' programs ', ' South Carolina ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Awareness ', ' interest ', ' Church ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Missionary ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' Communities ', ' fight against ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' 12 year old ', ' twelve year old ', ' age 12 years ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,U01,2007,75291,0.21518578554261664

"Cervical Cancer Control in Vietnamese Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vietnamese American women have higher rates of invasive cervical cancer than any other racial/ethnic group (43 per 100,000 compared to 8 per 100,000 among non-Latina white women). Further, approximately 25% of Vietnamese women have never received a Pap smear (compared to 5% of non-Latina white women). The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Panel on cervical cancer has recommended that funding priorities should include research focusing on racial/ethnic minority populations and women who have never had a Pap smear.   We have previously developed a culturally and linguistically appropriate cervical cancer control outreach intervention for Vietnamese women, and documented its acceptability and feasibility in terms of program delivery. Our primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of our outreach intervention in increasing the uptake of Pap testing among never screened Vietnamese women. Secondary objectives are as follows: to examine the effectiveness of the intervention in improving knowledge about cervical cancer and Pap testing; to document the costs of the program; and to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.  A randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Trial participants will include 250 Vietnamese American women, aged 20-79 years, who have never been screened for cervical cancer. These women will be identified from a community-based survey of 1,000 Vietnamese households. Participants will be individually randomized to intervention or control status. Bilingual, bicultural Vietnamese women will deliver the cervical cancer control outreach intervention to women in the intervention arm. The intervention will include home visits, follow-up telephone calls, use of a video and pamphlet, and tailored counseling and logistic assistance. Outcome evaluation will be based on a follow-up survey as well as medical record verification of self-reported Pap testing.  If effective and cost-effective, our cervical cancer control intervention could be incorporated into outreach programs conducted by health care facilities and community-based organizations serving Vietnamese Americans, as well an the national Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program.

"Facilitating Follow-up Adherence for Abnormal Pap Smears DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the overall decline in cervical cancer, there is a large disparity between disease-related incidence and mortality rates for African Americans (AA) and Latinas compared to Caucasians. Adherence to diagnostic colposcopy and follow-up regimens is crucial after an abnormal Pap smear result indicative of oncogenic HPV (approximately 75 percent of abnormalities), since early detection and medical management can prevent invasive cervical cancer. However, rates of adherence to initial diagnostic colposcopy and subsequent medical recommendations remain low among low-income minority populations. Hence, there is a need to develop and evaluate the efficacy of culturally- sensitive, transportable health communication protocols to facilitate adherence over time. Guided by the Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP) model, this randomized controlled trial aims to conduct a head-to-head comparison of a tailored counseling intervention protocol, delivered through either telephone or mail-home print, designed to assess and address cognitive- affective barriers to adherence among low-income AAs and Latinas prior to the initial diagnostic colposcopy appointment. Patients (N=730) will receive a barriers assessment and will be randomly assigned to: 1) standard care (SC; notification letter plus telephone appointment confirmation); 2) telephone barriers counseling (CAB-T; SC plus tailored Cognitive-Affective Barriers Counseling delivered by phone); or 3) print barriers counseling (CAB-P; SC plus tailored Cognitive-Affective Barriers Print materials delivered via mail). Additional aims are to explore the cognitive-affective mediators of intervention impact and the moderating role of attentional style on the individual's cognitive-affective processing profile. Outcome measures will assess adherence to initial colposcopy and to follow-up management recommendations over the 15-month cervical surveillance cycle, cognitive-affective processes (risk-related knowledge/perceptions, fatalism, motivation to adhere, intrusive/avoidant ideation, health-related planning) and intervention cost-effectiveness. Psychosocial assessments will be conducted by telephone at baseline (2-4 weeks pre-colposcopy), and at 1-week, 9-months, and 15-months post-index colposcopy. A dissemination plan will be developed from study outcomes data, the cost-effectiveness analysis, patient intervention evaluations, and input from a Community Advisory Committee and on-site staff. The study brings together two key strengths, expertise in: 1) cervical cancer risk assessment; and 2) the design and analysis of transportable tailored counseling protocols targeted to underserved at-risk groups. Findings are relevant not only to the management of precancerous cervical disease, but will also lay the groundwork for counseling protocols that can be readily disseminated into routine care to increase adherence to medical regimens, with a view to ultimately reducing the disparity in disease rates among underserved populations.

"Cervical Cancer Screening in Lesbians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates have decreased significantly during the last 50 years due to widespread screening with the Papanicolaou (Pap) test. However, subgroups of women continue to be at elevated risk of cervical cancer due to underutilization of screening services. Lesbians are an underserved group of women who participate in routine cervical cancer screening at rates below below recommended rates and below that of the general population of women. Failure to be screened is of great importance for these women because inadequate screening may lead to later diagnosis, diagnosis of more advanced disease, greater morbidity and mortality, and thus, disproportionate burden of disease for this subgroup of women. The primary aim of this proposal is to identify factors associated with participation in routine cervical cancer screening in lesbians based on constructs from the Health Belief and PRECEDE-PROCEED models. Factors that will be explored include: knowledge of cervical cancer risk factors and screening guidelines; perceived susceptibility, barriers, and benefits of cervical cancer screening; and cues to action (e.g., physician recommendation for Pap). We will also explorate contextual factors that are unique to lesbians and are related to cervical cancer screening behavior; factors that will be explored will include: perceived discrimination, insurance status, experiences in health care settings, and differing reproductive health care needs of lesbians. We hypothesize that compared to lesbians who participate in routine screening, lesbians that do not participate in routine cervical cancer screening will: (1)be less knowledgeable about cervical cancer risk factors and guidelines; (2)have lower perceived susceptibility to cervical cancer, and perceive greater barriers; (3)perceive fewer benefits to screening; and (4)be less likely to receive physician recommendation for Pap test. We propose a cross-sectional study of approximately 1,000 self-identified lesbians randomly selected from a large pool of internet survey respondents maintained by Harris Interactive. The proposed study will use Internet survey methodology. Successful completion of this study will contribute to the public health objective of increasing women's overall rates of participation in cervical cancer screening-a Healthy People 2010 objective-- and allow us to design an intervention to address barriers to screening in lesbians and increase their adherence to recommended screening guidelines. Lesbians are an underserved, understudied group of women who may be at greater risk for cervical cancer due to their health habits, perceptions, and behaviors. Reducing cancer disparities in underserved groups of women is a major public health objective outlined in the Healthy People 2010 plan. The proposed study will allow us to identify critical barriers to Pap screening in lesbians and to use these findings to design an intervention to address barriers to screening in order to increase rates of screening in this underserved group of women.             ",Cervical Cancer Screening in Lesbians,7305982,R21CA120635,"['Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Uninsured ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' base ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medical ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Incidence ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Lesbian ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Respondent ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Nature ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Woman ', ' Behavior ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Visit ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Misinformation ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cues ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Subgroup ', ' Rate ', ' Guidelines ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2007,204500,0.24311584968325872
"Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening in Obese Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate's long-term career goal is to understand how primary medical care impacts cancer outcomes and to develop interventions that will improve primary medical care in this regard.  Primary medical care is important in helping to decrease cancer incidence and mortality and to understand the causes of health disparities in cancer stage and survival.  UMDNJ- New Jersey Medical School, located in Newark, New Jersey is surrounded by a community affected by heavier burdens of cancer incidence, late stage cancer at diagnosis, and cancer mortality.  The adjacent counties surrounding the school contain 27.3 % of New Jersey's total population, but 52.4% of its African-American population and 49.7% of the state's Hispanic population.  This population is ideal for studying the causes of late stage cancer diagnosis and racial disparities in cancer stage and survival.  In collaboration with the Cancer Institute of New Jersey, the institution is developing, as a top priority, research and clinical programs to address deficits in cancer care in northern New Jersey and major health disparities evident in Newark and its environs.  The PI's career objectives of this proposal are to increase quantitative skills in data analysis, to refine skills in survey research, to learn qualitative research methods, and to learn how to integrate culture, language, and literacy into cancer control interventions.  The research career development plan includes: completion of a Masters in Public Health degree program, the NCI's ""Principles and Practice of Cancer Prevention and Control Course,"" a review course on SAS statistical software, a training course on SUDAAN Statistical Software, completion of the Cancer, Culture, and Literacy Institute, various other cancer and research forums, and the conduct of mentored multi-method research.      This multi-method research project will focus on breast and cervical cancer screening in an at risk subpopulation: obese women.  Obese women are more likely than nonobese women to be delayed in breast and cervical cancer screening.  Since African-American and Hispanic women are disproportionately obese compared to other races, this study may impact racial disparities in cancer.  First, new analyses will be conducted using data from the National Health Interview Survey to quantify the extent of the association of obesity to delayed cancer screening, and the impact of race/ethnicity and comorbidity on this association.  Next, focus groups will be conducted with obese women to identify their barriers to cancer screening.  In addition, in-depth interviews and a mail survey will be administered to physicians to identify their barriers to cancer screening in obese women and to elicit suggestions to overcome those barriers.  Finally, an interventional plan and materials will be developed that are appropriate for a multicultural target group and evaluated for appropriateness, readability, and feasibility through focus groups of patients and physicians.

"Reducing Cervical Cancer in Appalachia    In response to RFA ES-02-009, a multi-disciplinary group of investigators from the Ohio State University and the University of Michigan have collaborated to propose a Center for Population Health and Health Disparities focusing on an important health issue in underserved populations,cancer. The Center will initially focus on the goal of understanding why high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are observed in Appalachia Ohio, a mainly rural area in Southern and Eastern Ohio. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research within the framework of the Social Determinants of Health model in three inter-related projects and four supporting cores. All studies will be conducted in 16 clinics which represent the general population of women aged 18 and older in the region. We will utilize the Center's internal and external advisory committees and community partners organized into a community advisory board and Consortium of communityorganizations to facilitate the accomplishment of project goals. Project 1 will recruit 1600 women to an observational study to  investigate multi-level (social, environmental, behavioral, and biological) correlates of ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization, in Phase I. From this cohort of women, those who smoke (30%) will be eligible to participate in Project 2, which tests the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote smoking cessation (behavioral) and validate cessation endpoints with saliva cotinine measurements (biological) in a quasi-experimental trial design; those women who are in need of & Pap test (48% of 1600) will be eligible to participate in Phase II of Project 1 which will test the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization (behavioral) and follow-up for abnormalities (biological) detected in a quasi-experimental trial design. Project 3 will examine the contribution of HPV (biological) to cervical abnormalities in Appalachia in relation to individual-level behaviors (e.g. smoking, sexual activity) within the social and environmental region of Appalachia in a case-control observational study among women who have Pap smears in these 16 clinics.The research will be supported by four cores: A) Administration - fiscal and Center oversight; B) Biostatistics and Data Resources - sample selection, data management, data analysis, and population data resources; C) Clinical Correlative Sciences - collect, obtain and process biomarker specimens; and D) Behavioral Assessment and Intervention - train interviewers and lay health educators, conduct interviews, design intervention material, and facilitate  communication amongst sites. The Center includes a mechanism for pilot project solicitation, review and funding. This Center has institutional commitment in terms of personnel, funds and space, as well as, a commitment to focus on the problem of health disparities in the region.

"HPV Testing in Cervical Cancer Screening: Time Trends and Evidence-Based Practice    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching objective of this research is to describe time trends and identify potential barriers to use of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing in routine cervical cancer screening practice. High-risk HPV infection is a necessary, but insufficient cause of cervical cancer. A preponderance of evidence supports the use of HPV DNA testing in cervical cancer screening of women 30 years and older to improve the cost- effectiveness of cervical cancer prevention. However, little is known about actual provider use of the test. Rapid assessment of HPV DNA testing uptake in routine cervical cancer screening is directly responsive to the CDC's Health Protection Goal of `Healthy People at Every Stage in Life,' specifically starter objectives among adults, older adults, and the elderly, as related to chronic disease prevention, infectious diseases prevention, and increasing the number of individuals who receive preventive health services. Cervical cancer rates continue to reflect racial and socio-economic disparities and this research will focus on a CDC priority population, women, including low-income groups, minority groups, and the elderly. To examine provider use of HPV DNA testing in routine cervical cancer screening, provider practice data collected at Johns Hopkins Hospital & Health System in Baltimore, Maryland from 2001-2006 will be utilized. The Division of Cytopathology will provide cross-sectional specimen record data and associated de-identified patient information. Provider information will be purchased, de-identified, and appended to the appropriate specimen record. Specific Aim 1 will assess temporal trends of HPV DNA testing in women 30 years and older and will compare these trends with the uptake of HPV DNA testing for follow-up of abnormal Pap test results of undetermined significance (i.e., ASC-US triage). Specific Aim 2 will identify provider and patient characteristics associated with evidence-based and non-evidence based use of HPV DNA testing in general screening. This research will establish baseline screening practices prior to wide HPV vaccine coverage and release of updated screening guidelines. Identifying current factors related to appropriate practices may allow for preemptive intervention, if needed, for future guideline changes. If HPV DNA testing fails to be properly used in screening for women 30 years and older and annual Pap testing is maintained as the status quo, the US will divert critical health care dollars away from more pressing needs in this large, aging population. Broad uptake of HPV DNA testing in routine screening of women 30 years and older is critical for continuing the decline in cervical cancer incidence without inflating the cost of its prevention. In order to achieve the most cost-effective combination of screening and HPV vaccination, it's crucial to monitor and characterize the uptake of HPV DNA testing in routine screening.              ",HPV Testing in Cervical Cancer Screening: Time Trends and Evidence-Based Practice,7405649,R36CK000103,[''],CDC,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R36,2007,33684,0.2365150433317006
"HPV Vaccination: Acceptance, Delivery, and Policy Implications    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This pilot project, submitted by the University of Maryland School of Medicine's (UMSOM) ""Maryland Regional Community Network (MRCN)"", addresses the national priority to reduce and eventually eliminate cancer health disparities as experienced by racial/ethnic minorities. The pilot project is collaboration between UMSOM and its MRCN Community Partners. The pilot project's long-term goal is to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality through evidence guided community and health care professional education and state-level policy initiatives, which enhance delivery and uptake of HPV immunization: The short-term goals of the pilot project are to determine the facilitators and barriers to HPV vaccination delivery by health care professionals and uptake by eligible adolescents, and to determine policy and regulatory impediments to HPV immunization. The pilot project's specific aims are: Specific Aim#1: To determine, using qualitative methods, facilitators and barriers in terms of awareness, community readiness and acceptance of cervical cancer control and HPV immunization as viewed by key stakeholders (parents, faith based and community-based organization [CBO] leaders, adolescents, and health care professionals) by race/ethnicity (African Americans and non-Hispanic Whites), geography (rural and urban), and practice setting (academic and community health centers). Specific Airri#2: To develop a policy analysis model of Maryland cervical cancer policies and related regulations, and document feasibility/impediments to implement policies and regulations for mandated HPV immunization and cervical cancer control. Specific Aim#3: To develop educational programs specifically tailored for key stakeholders (parents, educators, faith based and CBO leaders), adolescents, health care professionals, and health policy/decision makers and designed to increase awareness and knowledge of cervical cancer disparities, cervical cancer prevention and control, HPV immunization recommendations, HPV vaccine availability and its role in cervical cancer prevention.          ","HPV Vaccination: Acceptance, Delivery, and Policy Implications",7336599,U01CA114650,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' training project ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Geography ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Site ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Interview ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' Maryland ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Nurse Practitioners ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatric Nursing ', ' Pediatric/Adolescence Nursing ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Target Populations ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Awareness ', ' Baltimore ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Regulation ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' design ', ' designing ', "" Maryland's Lower Eastern Shore "", ' Lower Eastern Shore ', ' Coupled ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,U01,2007,74500,0.2621841529899298
"Translating an Efficaious HPV Vaccine into the Control of Cervical Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The FDA approval in summer 2006 of an efficacious human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine provides an unprecedented opportunity for the primary prevention of cervical cancer. However, little is known about how to effectively deliver this vaccine to those most likely to benefit from its use: medically underserved pre- adolescent females. To translate this breakthrough into reduced cervical cancer incidence rates in the underserved, we must first take steps to enhance the likelihood that medically underserved teen and preteen females receive the HPV vaccine. The objective of this proposal is to gain information to develop effective educational interventions and then develop the intervention. To achieve this objective, we propose to address the following specific aims: 1) To conduct formative, qualitative research to identify factors that act as barriers to vaccines in general and to HPV vaccination in particular in medically underserved communities, especially among parents and pre- adolescent and early adolescent females. 2) To plan and develop an educational intervention to enhance informed decision-making in underserved communities concerning HPV vaccine delivery to pre-adolescent/early adolescent females. Using focus group methodology, we will characterize similarities and differences in perception of HPV vaccination in multiple groups of African Americans, Latinos, and white Americans. Focus groups will be conducted among both adult community stakeholders and pre-adolescent/adolescent females to assess inter- generational differences in perceptions. Comparisons of results between racial/ethnic groups will allow us to determine the value of tailoring subsequent interventions. This project addresses a timely, novel research topic that is translational by disseminating a scientific breakthrough to the general population to advance the public's health. This work will be carried out by a highly-qualified interdisciplinary research team, will address racial/ethnic disparities in the burden of cervical cancer, and will form the basis for a subsequent R01 to test interventions that will ultimately contribute to a U.S. model for cervical cancer control. The quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been shown to virtually prevent 70% of cervical cancers when given to preteen girls. Information about the vaccine and its utilization are critical components in making the prevention of cervical cancer a reality. Understanding barriers and misperceptions that underserved communities have concerning the vaccine and cervical cancer will enable researchers to develop and test educational interventions that are ethnically and culturally effective and that ultimately enable vaccine acceptance.          ",Translating an Efficaious HPV Vaccine into the Control of Cervical Cancer,7336975,R03CA130724,"['Human papillomavirus 6 ', ' Human papillomavirus type 6 ', ' Human papilloma virus type 6 ', ' Human papilloma virus 6 ', ' HPV6 ', ' HPV 6 ', ' Human papillomavirus 11 ', ' Human papillomavirus type 11 ', ' Human papilloma virus type 11 ', ' Human papilloma virus 11 ', ' HPV11 ', ' HPV 11 ', ' Decision Making ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Virus-like particle ', ' viruslike particle ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' vaccine delivery ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Qualifying ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Rate ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Gardasil ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Cervical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Ensure ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Papillomavirus ', ' Papilloma Viruses ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Prevent infection ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' preadolescence ', ' preteen ', ' novel ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' girls ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Cervical cancer vaccine ', ' Population ', ' Oncogenic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' novel vaccines ', ' next generation vaccines ', ' new vaccines ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Anogenital venereal warts ', ' Venereal Warts ', ' Genital Warts ', ' Condylomata Acuminata ', ' Condyloma Accuminata ', ' Human papillomavirus 16 ', ' type 16 Human papillomavirus ', ' type 16 Human papilloma virus ', ' human papilloma virus 16 ', ' Human papillomavirus type 16 ', ' Human papilloma virus type 16 ', ' HPV16 ', ' HPV-16 ', ' HPV 16 ', ' Human papillomavirus 18 ', ' human papilloma virus 18 ', ' Human papillomavirus type 18 ', ' Human papilloma virus type 18 ', ' HPV18 ', ' HPV-18 ', ' HPV 18 ', ' ']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R03,2007,76063,0.2426150485072101
"C-CAPRELA: Cervical Cancer Prevention for Latinas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latina women living in the U.S. are twice as likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer and 40% more likely to die from the disease than non-Latina whites. Lower utilization of Pap smear contributes to greater cervical cancer mortality among Latinas, with recently-immigrated, uninsured women from Mexico at greatest risk of inadequate Pap smear utilization. To reduce this disparity, we propose to: 1. Increase routine Pap smear screening rates among uninsured Latina women living in the southeast using an empowerment-based, communication skills-building intervention. 2. Explore changes in knowledge, barriers, self-efficacy, and shared-decision making after the intervention and evaluate the impact of these factors on Pap smear screening rates. This pilot study uses a quasi-experimental community trial design to address these aims. The proposed community-based intervention uses a lay health advisor model to educate women about cervical cancer etiology and preventive strategies and to empower them with communication skills that will help them negotiate the medical encounter. Our research has several advantages beyond what has been documented to date: (1) The research is targeted to women in need of a Pap smear and who are at highest risk of not having one ; (2) The intervention combines education AND empowerment, a considerable advantage over previous research that has focused exclusively on increasing knowledge. (3) Empowerment, through skills- building, is grounded in theory and is culturally-appropriate; (4) The quasi-experimental community-trial design allows us to move beyond feasibility and actually test the effect of the intervention at the community- level; (5) The intervention will be easily replicated and disseminated given the size and scope of the project; (6) To date, no such interventions have been rigorously tested among newly arrived uninsured Latinas in the southeast. Given that the southeast has the fastest growing Mexican immigrant population in the U.S. and health systems are just beginning to respond to their health needs, this research study is strongly justified. Our research aims address NCI's 2006 strategic investment cancer research to ""overcome the unequal burden of cancer experienced by various population groups by ....developing effective interventions to reduce those disparities, and facilitating intervention delivery.""          ",C-CAPRELA: Cervical Cancer Prevention for Latinas,7226352,R03CA115190,"['Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Population Group ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Community Trial ', ' Preparation ', ' Rate ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Custom ', ' Affect ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Medical ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Investments ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Learning ', ' Mexican ', ' Husband ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mexico ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Immigrant ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Punishment ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Residencies ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' English Language ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Route ', ' size ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Uninsured ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' ']",NCI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2007,74000,0.15613194239662603
"""Patient Navigation in the SafetyNet: CONNECTeDD""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Despite advances in early detection and treatment options, racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status women continue to suffer advanced stage at diagnosis and higher mortality for both breast and cervical cancer. Delays in diagnosis and treatment, which contribute to poorer outcomes, have been associated with well known barriers to care. These disparities persist despite this knowledge represents a gap between discovery and delivery of cancer care resulting in a pressing need for effective interventions.   The objective of this study is to design, implement and evaluate a patient navigator intervention at six community health centers in Boston, Massachusetts. These sites represents a wide range of racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status women served by an urban safety net institution that mirrors the infrastructure of this country's urban health systems. The intervention is a model based on Andersen's Model of Health Services Use. Aided by an Electronic Medical Record tracking system and theory based cultural competency training, patient navigators will: identify cases, provide service coordination and direct patient support.   Our specific aims are to determine if the intervention will:   1. Reduce time to diagnosis (or resolution of abnormality) after an abnormal mammogram or Pap smear; 2. Reduce time to complete treatment and provide higher quality treatment after a cancer diagnosis; 3. Improve patient satisfaction with health care services; 4. Have critical components (time with patient vs. time coordinating care) which drive its success; 5. Result in more cost-effective care.   We will use a quasi-experimental design with block randomization of six community health centers whose primary affiliation is with Boston Medical Center. Each site will be randomly assigned to either Breast or Cervical Patient Navigation. Thus, each of the Breast intervention sites will serve as a continuous comparison site for the Cervical intervention sites and vice versa.   We expect that the results of this study will inform the design of a generalizable standard, effective and cost efficient patient navigation model that will eliminate barriers to timely, quality cancer care among racial/ethnic minority and lower income populations         ","""Patient Navigation in the SafetyNet: CONNECTeDD""",7284808,U01CA116892,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Range ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resolution ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Scientific Evaluation ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Hospitals ', ' Cervical ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Low Income Population ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Boston ', ' Breast ', ' expectation ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Modeling ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' tv watching ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' safety net ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2007,801389,0.045219341004168245
"HPV in Heterosexual Couples    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Introduction: As effective human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines become available, epidemiologic research on HPV and cervical cancer will continue to be important: vaccine uptake will not be immediate or universal, and vaccines will not initially target all oncogenic types; furthermore, gains in knowledge may be relevant for other cancers. Methods: We have a time-sensitive opportunity to add substantially to our understanding of HPV transmission between young, high-risk heterosexual partners, and to clarify the controversial role of condom use and male circumcision, by adding an HPV sub-study to ""Dual STI Prevention Interventions for Minority Couples"", a randomized controlled trial of a cognitive-behavioral intervention to reduce sexually transmitted infections (STI). This study is currently enrolling 500 minority heterosexual couples; all women have non-viral STI at baseline. All 1000 individuals will be followed for one year, with specimen collection and detailed interviews at baseline, six months, and twelve months followup. For the proposed R03 project, ""HPV in Heterosexual Couples"", we will collect genital swab samples, and blood samples, from men and women in the parent study. These samples will provide a unique resource for an R01-scale study to evaluate transmission dynamics of HPV in a high-risk population of heterosexual minority couples. We have already submitted an R01 application to conduct genital HPV DNA typing and viral load for males and females; conduct serologic testing for HPV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 for males and females; assess cervical inflammation for females; and conduct detailed statistical analyses. We are also submitting the current R03 application, in light of the possibility that the R01 may not immediately be funded. Outcomes: The major contribution of this project will be to create a valuable bank of stored specimens. These specimens can be used in the future to shed light on heterosexual transmission of HPV, and factors affecting probability of transmission. In particular, we will be able to assess the role of male circumcision, the impact of condoms using extremely detailed behavioral data, the impact of concurrent STIs in either partner, and HPV viral load in the infecting partner. This study of ethnic minorities is a cost- effective way to answer current questions about factors affecting HPV transmission between heterosexual couples. Relevance: The proposed sample collection will provide the basis for future analyses to significantly increase our understanding of heterosexual transmission of HPV in a young, high-risk minority population. We will be able to elucidate the impact of condoms, male circumcision, and concurrent STIs, as well as help to shed light on ethnic disparities in cervical cancer risk.           ",HPV in

"A Population-Based HPV Survey of Women in South Carolina    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genital human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is the most common viral sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States (US). Much is known about the etiological relationship of oncogenic (called high- risk) types of HPV to cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer, yet little is delivered to the general population as demonstrated by limited HPV knowledge and lack of available HPV educational interventions for women. Furthermore, most psychosocial and behavioral HPV studies have been conducted in clinic-based samples of women; thus, the proposed study will include a population-based sample to fill a gap in scientific knowledge that will lead to subsequent action in South Carolina (SC), which has high rates of cervical cancer and excess cervical cancer mortality, and other similar populations. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: (1) determine key knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, experiences, and sociodemographic characteristics related to HPV knowledge, HPV vaccine and self-collection acceptability; (2) identify preferences for HPV educational information; and (3) gather preliminary data to inform the development of culturally- and linguistically-appropriate HPV educational interventions in the future. A cross-sectional study of a population-based sample of 1,000 women, aged 18 to 70, in SC will be conducted over a two month period. The sample will be approximately 40% African American and include rural women. Telephone interviews in English lasting approximately 25 minutes will be conducted by trained, female interviewers at the University of South Carolina (USC) survey research lab. The questionnaire will be developed for the study by conducting a systematic literature review, comparing newly identified items to items used previously by the investigators, expert review, and pretesting. Questionnaire development will be guided by a conceptual framework: Health Belief Model, self-efficacy construct of Social Cognitive Theory, and PEN-3 model. The items on the questionnaire will assess knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, experiences, and sociodemographic characteristics related to HPV and cervical cancer, HPV vaccine acceptability, and HPV self-collection. Data will be analyzed using appropriate statistical procedures for binary; summative, count, and continuous; and ordered discrete outcome variables to determine significant predictors of HPV knowledge, vaccine acceptability, and self-collection as well as determine preferences for HPV educational information. The proposed study will actively involve one graduate research assistant and other graduate students, as interested, in a supportive research environment at USC. The findings of the proposed study will be used to inform the development of future HPV educational interventions. Having a greater understand of women's experiences on a population- based level will lead to more effective educational interventions to promote informed decision making regarding emerging HPV technologies (i.e., vaccine, self-collection) to address excess cervical cancer mortality. The proposed study will provide crucial, preliminary, population-based data in order to submit a large- scale application to develop and implement innovative, culturally- and literacy- appropriate HPV educational interventions, especially for poor and underserved women, to address excess cervical cancer mortality, which is a public health priority. Additional studies of acceptance of emerging HPV technologies (i.e., vaccine and self-collection) that have the potential to eradicate cervical cancer are needed.                ",A Population-Based HPV Survey of Women in South Carolina,7193753,R15CA125600,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Institution ', ' Purpose ', ' Genital Human Papilloma Virus Infection ', ' Genital Human papillomavirus Infection ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Academic Research Enhancement Awards ', ' R15 Program ', ' R15 Mechanism ', ' Academic Research Enhancement Awards (Area) ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Collection ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Behavioral ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Procedures ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Interviewer ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' literacy ', ' Rural ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Collaborations ', ' Review Literature ', ' Papillomavirus ', ' Papilloma Viruses ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' South Carolina ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' Count ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervical dysplasia ', ' Cervix Dysplasia ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Oncogenic ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccines ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' Genital system ', ' urogenital system (genital part) ', ' Genital ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R15,2007,211854,0.2730846385717301
"Reducing Cervical Cancer in Appalachia In response to RFA ES-02-009, a multi-disciplinary group of investigators from the Ohio State University and the University of Michigan have collaborated to propose a Center for Population Health and Health Disparities focusing on an important health issue in underserved populations,cancer. The Center will initiallyfocus on the goal of understanding w_b_high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are observed in Appalachia Ohio, a mainly rural area in Southern and Eastern Ohio. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research within the framework of the Social Determinants of Health model in three inter-related projects and four supporting cores. All studies will be conducted in 16 clinicswhich represent the general population of women aged 18 and older in the region. We will utilize the Center's internal and external advisory committees and community partners organized into a community advisory board and Consortium of communityorganizations to facilitate the accomplishmentof project goals. Project 1 will recruit 1600 women to an observational study to investigatemulti-level (social, environmental, behavioral, and biological) correlates of ""risk-appropriate""Pap smear utilization, in Phase I. From this cohort of women, those who smoke (30%) will be eligible to participate in Project 2, which tests the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote smoking cessation (behavioral) and validate cessation endpoints with saliva cotinine measurements (biological) in a quasi-experimental trial .design; those women who are in need of & Pap test (48% of 1600) will be eligible to participate in Phase II of Project 1 which will test the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization (behavioral) and follow-up for abnormalities (biological) detected in a quasi-experimental trial design. Project 3 will examine the contributionof HPV (biological) to cervical abnormalities in Appalachia in relation to individual-level behaviors (e.g. smoking, sexual activity) within the social and environmental region of Appalachia in a case-control observational study among women who have Pap smears in these 16 clinics.The research will be supported by four cores: A) Administration - fiscal and Center oversight; B) Biostatistics and Data Resources - sample selection, data management, data analysis, and population data resources; C) Clinical Correlative Sciences - collect, obtain and process biomarker specimens; and D) Behavioral Assessment and Intervention - train interviewers and lay health educators, conduct interviews, design intervention material, and facilitate communication amongst sites. The Center includes a mechanism for pilot project solicitation, review and funding. This Center has institutionalcommitment in terms of personnel, funds and space, as well as, a commitment to focus on the problem of health disparities in the region. Finally, members of the team have worked together in the past in various settings that focus on the goals of the proposed Center and have an established relationship in Appalachian Ohio for the purpose of improvingthe health of the population. Future work of this Center will focus on moving this type of multi-level observational and interventional community-based research, into other areas where health disparitiesexist in relation to cancer withinour region.

"An Exploration of the Determinants that Impact Breast and Cervical Cancer Control    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Lay health advisor (LHA) intervention models have been increasingly utilized in American Indian and Alaskan Native (AI/AN) communities to address disparities in access to and utilization of recommended breast and cervical cancer early detection exams, including mammograms and Pap exams. While recent studies have documented moderate effectiveness of lay health advisor programs in increasing breast and cervical cancer screening rates in AI/AN communities, no studies have explored the attitudes, beliefs, and norms of tribal lay health advisors themselves, especially in interventions that target a highly stigmatized disease such as cancer. Further, researchers have yet to explore factors external to lay health advisors, such as fragmented health care systems and power imbalances, which may affect the capacity of LHAs to provide breast and cervical cancer-specific services. An investigation of these factors is therefore essential to elucidate future capacity development and intervention strategies for tribal lay health advisor programs to maximize their ability to bolster breast and cervical cancer early detection in their communities. To address this critical gap in scientific knowledge, this research project will conduct in-depth interviews with tribal lay health advisors to explore and analyze the key determinants which impact their ability to integrate cancer control activities into their scope of services. It is hypothesized that a host of determinants, not just cancer-specific knowledge and education alone, explains the variation in behavioral intentions of tribal LHAs to perform this critical health promotion role. Specific aims of this study are to: (1) develop an interview schedule that incorporates the constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior, to explore the attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control of tribal LHAs, and to elucidate the pathways through which these factors impact their behavioral intentions to provide breast & cervical cancer- specific health education and/or navigational services to community women; (2) conduct open-ended, in- depth interviews with at least 30 tribal LHAs and LHA Directors; (3) utilize Grounded Theory to systematically analyze interview transcripts and identify relevant patterns, themes, and theoretical associations that explain the linkages between attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavior control and the behavioral intentions of tribal LHAs to incorporate cancer control activities into their scope of services; (4) identify elements of the social, cultural, and political context of tribal communities that can be integrated into pre-intervention capacity development with tribal LHAs to maximize their effectiveness in providing cancer-specific educational and navigational services; and (5) identify community and health care system leverage points for intervention, which can be targeted concurrently with the implementation of LHA interventions, to improve the coordination and delivery of breast and cervical cancer early detection services in tribal communities. This study will explore and analyze the factors that impact the ability of tribal lay health advisors to promote early detection of breast and cervical cancer, two highly stigmatized diseases for which American Indian people experience disproportionately poor survival rates. It will also inform the capacity development needs of tribal lay health advisors to maximize their effectiveness in providing breast and cervical cancer-specific educational and navigational services. Moreover, this investigation will lead to the identification of tribal community and health care system leverage points for intervention, which can be targeted concurrently with the implementation of tribal lay health advisor interventions, to improve the coordination and delivery of breast and cervical cancer early detection services within American Indian communities.          ",An Exploration of the Determinants that Impact Breast and Cervical Cancer Control,7409945,R03CA132550,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Transcript ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' New Mexico ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Taboo ', ' Tribes ', ' Attitude ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Services ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Breast ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Native Alaskan ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Schedule ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Services ', ' care systems ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal communities ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' ']",NCI,ALBUQUERQUE AREA INDIAN HEALTH BOARD,R03,2007,50000,0.06335376560632895
"Learner Verification of Cervical Cancer Education with Mexican Immigrant Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): (ABSTRACT) Hispanic women in the U.S. have a 50% higher incidence of invasive cervical cancer than non-Hispanic women and Mexicans represent the largest faction of Hispanic immigrants. Findings from a preliminary study showed that elements of cervical cancer educational messages are not relevant to the needs of many Mexican immigrant women; messages are confusing, do not accurately transcend language barriers, do not relate to the women's existing knowledge and experience, and may elicit more fear than motivation. Additionally, aspects of language, reading level, structural format, and visual images within pamphlets pose learning problems for Mexican immigrant women, blocking their comprehension of the message at a fundamental level. The ultimate aim of the proposed research is to increase cervical cancer screening and decrease related morbidity and mortality for Mexican immigrant women. The specific aim of this study is to identify optimal educational presentations of cervical cancer education for this population, through a multi-site learner verification study. Learner verification and revision (LVR), a novel approach for cancer screening promotion, is an interview process to test the suitability of educational material for a targeted audience. In Phase I and II of the two year study, elements of cervical cancer education messages that have been shown to be troublesome for this population will be selected for study. Alternative approaches for presenting these elements will be developed, translated, and piloted, along with LVR interview questions. In Phase III, 45 interviews will be conducted in three cities in the Midwest and Texas, to assess responses of Mexican immigrant women to various presentations of key elements of the cervical cancer education. In Phase IV, findings will be analyzed to determine optimal presentation of key elements of cervical cancer education for Mexican immigrant women. Results of the study will expand the evidence base for culturally and literacy relevant cervical cancer control education for this vulnerable population. The evidence regarding optimal presentation of elements of the cervical cancer educational message can be applied in the development of various educational media formats aimed at decreasing the disparity of cervical cancer incidence in this population, and meeting the goals of Health People 2010. Results of the study will expand the evidence base for culturally and literacy relevant cervical cancer control education for a vulnerable population of Mexican immigrant women. The evidence regarding the effectiveness of presentation of elements of the cervical cancer education message can be applied in all media education formats. Enhanced learner comprehension of cervical cancer prevention education has the potential to decrease costs of suffering and death among Hispanic women, decrease costs of treatment for a largely uninsured population, decrease the disparity of cervical cancer incidence in this population, and aid in meeting the goals of Health People 2010.          ",Learner Verification of Cervical Cancer Education with Mexican Immigrant Women,7279576,R03CA124211,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ', ' ACOG ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cervical Cancer Education ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Comprehension ', ' Prevention education ', ' Future ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Cervical ', ' Site ', ' Invasive ', ' Phase ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Visual ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' literacy ', ' Mexican ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Immigrant ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Anthropology ', ' Population Decreases ', ' Population Growth ', ' Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Sociology ', ' Epistemology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Transcend ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' abstracting ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' response ', ' Uninsured ', ' theories ', ' Cities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cost ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Population ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI KANSAS CITY,R03,2007,74500,0.2003611381818339
"African American Attitudes Toward HPV Vaccination    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American cervical cancer mortality rates for Missouri are higher than those observed in the general population; and mortality rates in St. Louis City and county exceed the African American mortality rates for the state. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections among young people and it is associated with cervical cancer in women. The higher cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates observed among African Americans in St. Louis suggests the importance of HPV screening and vaccination for this community. While HPV consists of over 30 types of viruses that can be passed from one person to another through sexual contact, the HPV 16 virus accounts for approximately half of all cervical cancers in the world. Its prevalence in the US is highest among African American women (19.1 percent) compared to 12.5 percent among white women. There is now an approved prophylactic vaccine, Gardasil, available. The vaccine is recommended for girls 11 to12 years of age, but can be given to girls as young as nine and is also recommended for girls 13-18 year to catch up on or complete missed shots. Giving the vaccine to young girls is important because the vaccine is most effective when given to people prior to HPV infection. Surveys show that 68% of African American high school students are sexually active, which can result in HPV infection. St. Louis city is over 50% African American, with notable disparities in the teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease rates. These facts support the need for early vaccination if young African American girls are to be adequately protected from the effect of HPV. Historically, where there are no penalties or mandated vaccination requirements, immunization levels are consistently lower in the African American community compared to those of Whites or other minorities; a fact that suggests the need to assure that parents in the African American community are well-educated on HPV, HPV vaccination, and that we address barriers to vaccination. Working with our community partners, this project seeks to assess HPV knowledge, awareness of the vaccine, its benefits, and barriers to vaccination. We will conduct a cross sectional survey of 200 African American parents, and complete in depth interviews with 30 randomly selected parents to address three specific aims. The specific aims of this research effort are to: 1) determine knowledge about HPV, HPV vaccination and its relationship to cancer among African American parents; 2) determine acceptability of and intent to vaccinate among parents of African American girls nine to 17; and 3) describe the individual characteristics, cultural attitudes, social and environmental factors that affect African American parents' intent to vaccinate girls, nine to 17, against HPV. These data will be used to develop and test a culturally sensitive intervention designed to reduce the likelihood that disparities in HPV vaccination will emerge in the St. Louis African American community.      The Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECaD) is a multi- disciplinary community-focused program established to eliminate pervasive disparities of cancer education, prevention, and treatment. The SCC Senior Leadership made this program a top priority, and it subsequently developed a substantial infrastructure and scientific portfolio, which will be further strengthened by this proposal. Specific aims for the first year are: 1) To further develop the core organizational infrastructure within the SCC to support community-based participatory activities to reduce cancer health disparities by establishing a staff of multidisciplinary professionals critical to implementing the program. 2) To enhance existing relationships and build new partnerships with communities that suffer cancer health disparities and with other organizations with an interest in reducing cancer health disparities among members of these communities. 3) To form or further develop at least four collaborations with other NCI programs (i.e., NCI Centers/Divisions/offices other than the NCI Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities) for the purpose of reducing cancer health disparities. 4) To increase utilization of beneficial interventions to reduce cancer health disparities. 5) To leverage Community Networks Program (CNP) activities by maintaining and obtaining new non- CRCHD funding for community-based participatory activities directed at reducing cancer health disparities. 6) To identify specific metrics to measure effectiveness of this project. 7) To increase community participation in primary and secondary prevention activities. 8) To identify specific barriers to proportional accrual in clinical research studies. 9) To plan training program activities for investigators, staff, and trainees with regard to overcoming disparities and disparities-focused research.

"Participatory Research to Understand the Translation of HPV Vaccine Policy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In June of 2006, the FDA approved Merck's vaccine ""Guardasil"" which protects against 4 types of HPV infections, two which cause abnormal cervical dysplagia and two which cause genital warts. In the 15 months since the approval and the subsequent recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) that the vaccine be routinely administered to 11-12 year old girls, legislators in 41 states and the District of Columbia have introduced legislation to require, fund, or educate the public about the HPV vaccine, and at least 17 states have enacted some sort of legislation, including the state of New Mexico. In this application we propose to study the process of implementing policy regarding the HPV vaccine in the state of New Mexico, and related programmatic efforts to offer the vaccine and relevant education to parents and the public. This study is responsive to the call for proposals to conduct research on three areas of action: public policy, health care, and disease prevention. The Specific Aims are as follows: 1. Using a participatory process, identify and convene a stakeholder group composed of individuals involved in the health policy context 2. Explore the translation and impact of health policy initiatives regarding the dissemination of HPV vaccine and the promotion of informed decision making in New Mexico public schools and primary care settings. a. Conduct semi structured interviews with health policy makers, primary care providers, school based health providers and school administrators, in order to determine their perceptions of the roles b. Conduct focus group discussions with parents of 5th grade children c. Conduct ethnographic observations of the ongoing debate about the HPV vaccine dissemination policy 3. Together with the stakeholder group, interpret the data, develop and disseminate health policy recommendations regarding initiatives to support HPV vaccine dissemination and informed decision making leading to the reduction of cervical cancer health disparities in New Mexico. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The recent approval of the HPV vaccine is an important scientific advance but faces challenges in dissemination and implementation. This study will help to develop a better understanding of the factors that contribute to the development of HPV vaccine policy. These findings will be used to work toward the creation of strategies, both at the primary care and health policy level, to promote informed decision among patients with regard to the HPV vaccine that are consistent with community values.          ",Participatory Research to Understand the Translation of HPV Vaccine Policy,7497826,R21CA134259,"['methionylmethionine ', ' Met-Met ', ' Structure ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' social ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Administrator ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Communities ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' 12 year old ', ' twelve year old ', ' age 12 years ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Anogenital venereal warts ', ' Venereal Warts ', ' Genital Warts ', ' Condylomata Acuminata ', ' Condyloma Accuminata ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Institution ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Decision-Making about Childhood HPV Vaccination among Low SES Mothers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) and the necessary cause of cervical cancer, which disproportionately affects women of low socioeconomic status (SES). Introduction of the new HPV vaccine, currently available to females 9 to 26 years of age, therefore presents an unprecedented opportunity to eliminate disparities in cervical cancer morbidity and mortality through the primary prevention of the disease. Given the necessity of parental consent for the vaccination of minors, as well as the enhanced efficacy of the vaccine when delivered prior to the onset of the sexual activity, the present study explores decision-making regarding childhood HPV vaccination among low SES mothers of girl 9 to 17 years of age. A popular model of decision-making ' the Decision Support Framework (DSF) ' is used to guide both survey and brief, semi-structured interview questions aimed at determining the factors most predictive of mothers' expressed intentions towards HPV vaccination of their daughters and daughter's actual vaccination status at 8-month follow-up. Particular attention will be paid to modifiable barriers to HPV vaccination and will be used to guide future work to assist low SES mothers in making informed choices for their daughter regarding the vaccine. The ability of the new human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to eliminate socioeconomic disparities in cervical cancer will depend, in large part, on acceptability and uptake of the vaccine among low socioeconomic status (SES) mothers on behalf of their daughters, who are among those most at risk for the development of cervical cancer in the future. Given this, the present study explores decision-making about childhood HPV vaccination among low SES mothers of daughter 9 to 17 years of age (i.e., those who are eligible for the vaccine, but unable to provide their own consent for use). We use the Decision Support Framework (DSF) to guide baseline survey questions aimed at predicting mothers' vaccine intentions. Mothers will be recruited from an urban pediatric care clinic serving low income, primarily racial and ethnic minority patients. Eight months after their initial baseline assessment, clinic records will be used to determine daughter's HPV vaccination status, ranging from those who have completed the full series of three doses within 6 months to those who have not started the vaccine. Brief, semi-structured follow-up interviews will be conducted with a subset of mothers in each of the three child vaccination status groups. Questions will also be guided by the DSF and used to address the specific issues, concerns, and barriers that emerged for mothers in reference to pursuing the HPV vaccine for their daughter, including those who were successful completers of the vaccine series. Results from this research will be used to inform decision-making interventions for mothers from low SES backgrounds, many of whom may face unique barriers to vaccinating their daughters against HPV.             ",Decision-Making about Childhood HPV Vaccination among Low SES Mothers,7532200,R03CA130747,"['Daughter ', ' Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Caring ', ' Age-Years ', ' Consent ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Range ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Guidelines ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Series ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Interview ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minor ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Baseline Surveys ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Appointment ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Knowledge ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Trees ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Attention ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' Parental Consent ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Disease regression ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Completion Status ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' vaccine efficacy ', ' aged ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' ']",NCI,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R03,2008,88874,0.1892416019636083
"An Exploration of the Determinants that Impact Breast and Cervical Cancer Control    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Lay health advisor (LHA) intervention models have been increasingly utilized in American Indian and Alaskan Native (AI/AN) communities to address disparities in access to and utilization of recommended breast and cervical cancer early detection exams, including mammograms and Pap exams. While recent studies have documented moderate effectiveness of lay health advisor programs in increasing breast and cervical cancer screening rates in AI/AN communities, no studies have explored the attitudes, beliefs, and norms of tribal lay health advisors themselves, especially in interventions that target a highly stigmatized disease such as cancer. Further, researchers have yet to explore factors external to lay health advisors, such as fragmented health care systems and power imbalances, which may affect the capacity of LHAs to provide breast and cervical cancer-specific services. An investigation of these factors is therefore essential to elucidate future capacity development and intervention strategies for tribal lay health advisor programs to maximize their ability to bolster breast and cervical cancer early detection in their communities. To address this critical gap in scientific knowledge, this research project will conduct in-depth interviews with tribal lay health advisors to explore and analyze the key determinants which impact their ability to integrate cancer control activities into their scope of services. It is hypothesized that a host of determinants, not just cancer-specific knowledge and education alone, explains the variation in behavioral intentions of tribal LHAs to perform this critical health promotion role. Specific aims of this study are to: (1) develop an interview schedule that incorporates the constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior, to explore the attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control of tribal LHAs, and to elucidate the pathways through which these factors impact their behavioral intentions to provide breast & cervical cancer- specific health education and/or navigational services to community women; (2) conduct open-ended, in- depth interviews with at least 30 tribal LHAs and LHA Directors; (3) utilize Grounded Theory to systematically analyze interview transcripts and identify relevant patterns, themes, and theoretical associations that explain the linkages between attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavior control and the behavioral intentions of tribal LHAs to incorporate cancer control activities into their scope of services; (4) identify elements of the social, cultural, and political context of tribal communities that can be integrated into pre-intervention capacity development with tribal LHAs to maximize their effectiveness in providing cancer-specific educational and navigational services; and (5) identify community and health care system leverage points for intervention, which can be targeted concurrently with the implementation of LHA interventions, to improve the coordination and delivery of breast and cervical cancer early detection services in tribal communities. This study will explore and analyze the factors that impact the ability of tribal lay health advisors to promote early detection of breast and cervical cancer, two highly stigmatized diseases for which American Indian people experience disproportionately poor survival rates. It will also inform the capacity development needs of tribal lay health advisors to maximize their effectiveness in providing breast and cervical cancer-specific educational and navigational services. Moreover, this investigation will lead to the identification of tribal community and health care system leverage points for intervention, which can be targeted concurrently with the implementation of tribal lay health advisor interventions, to improve the coordination and delivery of breast and cervical cancer early detection services within American Indian communities.          ",An Exploration of the Determinants that Impact Breast and Cervical Cancer Control,7500786,R03CA132550,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Transcript ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' New Mexico ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Taboo ', ' Tribes ', ' Attitude ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Services ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Breast ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Native Alaskan ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Schedule ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Services ', ' care systems ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal communities ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' ']",NCI,ALBUQUERQUE AREA INDIAN HEALTH BOARD,R03,2008,50000,0.06335376560632895
"Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening in Obese Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate's long-term career goal is to understand how primary medical care impacts cancer outcomes and to develop interventions that will improve primary medical care in this regard.  Primary medical care is important in helping to decrease cancer incidence and mortality and to understand the causes of health disparities in cancer stage and survival.  UMDNJ- New Jersey Medical School, located in Newark, New Jersey is surrounded by a community affected by heavier burdens of cancer incidence, late stage cancer at diagnosis, and cancer mortality.  The adjacent counties surrounding the school contain 27.3 % of New Jersey's total population, but 52.4% of its African-American population and 49.7% of the state's Hispanic population.  This population is ideal for studying the causes of late stage cancer diagnosis and racial disparities in cancer stage and survival.  In collaboration with the Cancer Institute of New Jersey, the institution is developing, as a top priority, research and clinical programs to address deficits in cancer care in northern New Jersey and major health disparities evident in Newark and its environs.  The PI's career objectives of this proposal are to increase quantitative skills in data analysis, to refine skills in survey research, to learn qualitative research methods, and to learn how to integrate culture, language, and literacy into cancer control interventions.  The research career development plan includes: completion of a Masters in Public Health degree program, the NCI's ""Principles and Practice of Cancer Prevention and Control Course,"" a review course on SAS statistical software, a training course on SUDAAN Statistical Software, completion of the Cancer, Culture, and Literacy Institute, various other cancer and research forums, and the conduct of mentored multi-method research.      This multi-method research project will focus on breast and cervical cancer screening in an at risk subpopulation: obese women.  Obese women are more likely than nonobese women to be delayed in breast and cervical cancer screening.  Since African-American and Hispanic women are disproportionately obese compared to other races, this study may impact racial disparities in cancer.  First, new analyses will be conducted using data from the National Health Interview Survey to quantify the extent of the association of obesity to delayed cancer screening, and the impact of race/ethnicity and comorbidity on this association.  Next, focus groups will be conducted with obese women to identify their barriers to cancer screening.  In addition, in-depth interviews and a mail survey will be administered to physicians to identify their barriers to cancer screening in obese women and to elicit suggestions to overcome those barriers.  Finally, an interventional plan and materials will be developed that are appropriate for a multicultural target group and evaluated for appropriateness, readability, and feasibility through focus groups of patients and physicians.

"C-CAPRELA: Cervical Cancer Prevention for Latinas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latina women living in the U.S. are twice as likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer and 40% more likely to die from the disease than non-Latina whites. Lower utilization of Pap smear contributes to greater cervical cancer mortality among Latinas, with recently-immigrated, uninsured women from Mexico at greatest risk of inadequate Pap smear utilization. To reduce this disparity, we propose to: 1. Increase routine Pap smear screening rates among uninsured Latina women living in the southeast using an empowerment-based, communication skills-building intervention. 2. Explore changes in knowledge, barriers, self-efficacy, and shared-decision making after the intervention and evaluate the impact of these factors on Pap smear screening rates. This pilot study uses a quasi-experimental community trial design to address these aims. The proposed community-based intervention uses a lay health advisor model to educate women about cervical cancer etiology and preventive strategies and to empower them with communication skills that will help them negotiate the medical encounter. Our research has several advantages beyond what has been documented to date: (1) The research is targeted to women in need of a Pap smear and who are at highest risk of not having one ; (2) The intervention combines education AND empowerment, a considerable advantage over previous research that has focused exclusively on increasing knowledge. (3) Empowerment, through skills- building, is grounded in theory and is culturally-appropriate; (4) The quasi-experimental community-trial design allows us to move beyond feasibility and actually test the effect of the intervention at the community- level; (5) The intervention will be easily replicated and disseminated given the size and scope of the project; (6) To date, no such interventions have been rigorously tested among newly arrived uninsured Latinas in the southeast. Given that the southeast has the fastest growing Mexican immigrant population in the U.S. and health systems are just beginning to respond to their health needs, this research study is strongly justified.

"Facilitating Follow-up Adherence for Abnormal Pap Smears DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the overall decline in cervical cancer, there is a large disparity between disease-related incidence and mortality rates for African Americans (AA) and Latinas compared to Caucasians. Adherence to diagnostic colposcopy and follow-up regimens is crucial after an abnormal Pap smear result indicative of oncogenic HPV (approximately 75 percent of abnormalities), since early detection and medical management can prevent invasive cervical cancer. However, rates of adherence to initial diagnostic colposcopy and subsequent medical recommendations remain low among low-income minority populations. Hence, there is a need to develop and evaluate the efficacy of culturally- sensitive, transportable health communication protocols to facilitate adherence over time. Guided by the Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP) model, this randomized controlled trial aims to conduct a head-to-head comparison of a tailored counseling intervention protocol, delivered through either telephone or mail-home print, designed to assess and address cognitive- affective barriers to adherence among low-income AAs and Latinas prior to the initial diagnostic colposcopy appointment. Patients (N=730) will receive a barriers assessment and will be randomly assigned to: 1) standard care (SC; notification letter plus telephone appointment confirmation); 2) telephone barriers counseling (CAB-T; SC plus tailored Cognitive-Affective Barriers Counseling delivered by phone); or 3) print barriers counseling (CAB-P; SC plus tailored Cognitive-Affective Barriers Print materials delivered via mail). Additional aims are to explore the cognitive-affective mediators of intervention impact and the moderating role of attentional style on the individual's cognitive-affective processing profile. Outcome measures will assess adherence to initial colposcopy and to follow-up management recommendations over the 15-month cervical surveillance cycle, cognitive-affective processes (risk-related knowledge/perceptions, fatalism, motivation to adhere, intrusive/avoidant ideation, health-related planning) and intervention cost-effectiveness. Psychosocial assessments will be conducted by telephone at baseline (2-4 weeks pre-colposcopy), and at 1-week, 9-months, and 15-months post-index colposcopy. A dissemination plan will be developed from study outcomes data, the cost-effectiveness analysis, patient intervention evaluations, and input from a Community Advisory Committee and on-site staff. The study brings together two key strengths, expertise in: 1) cervical cancer risk assessment; and 2) the design and analysis of transportable tailored counseling protocols targeted to underserved at-risk groups. Findings are relevant not only to the management of precancerous cervical disease, but will also lay the groundwork for counseling protocols that can be readily disseminated into routine care to increase adherence to medical regimens, with a view to ultimately reducing the disparity in disease rates among underserved populations.

"Reducing Cervical Cancer in Appalachia    In response to RFA ES-02-009, a multi-disciplinary group of investigators from the Ohio State University and the University of Michigan have collaborated to propose a Center for Population Health and Health Disparities focusing on an important health issue in underserved populations,cancer. The Center will initially focus on the goal of understanding why high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are observed in Appalachia Ohio, a mainly rural area in Southern and Eastern Ohio. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research within the framework of the Social Determinants of Health model in three inter-related projects and four supporting cores. All studies will be conducted in 16 clinics which represent the general population of women aged 18 and older in the region. We will utilize the Center's internal and external advisory committees and community partners organized into a community advisory board and Consortium of communityorganizations to facilitate the accomplishment of project goals. Project 1 will recruit 1600 women to an observational study to  investigate multi-level (social, environmental, behavioral, and biological) correlates of ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization, in Phase I. From this cohort of women, those who smoke (30%) will be eligible to participate in Project 2, which tests the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote smoking cessation (behavioral) and validate cessation endpoints with saliva cotinine measurements (biological) in a quasi-experimental trial design; those women who are in need of & Pap test (48% of 1600) will be eligible to participate in Phase II of Project 1 which will test the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization (behavioral) and follow-up for abnormalities (biological) detected in a quasi-experimental trial design. Project 3 will examine the contribution of HPV (biological) to cervical abnormalities in Appalachia in relation to individual-level behaviors (e.g. smoking, sexual activity) within the social and environmental region of Appalachia in a case-control observational study among women who have Pap smears in these 16 clinics.The research will be supported by four cores: A) Administration - fiscal and Center oversight; B) Biostatistics and Data Resources - sample selection, data management, data analysis, and population data resources; C) Clinical Correlative Sciences - collect, obtain and process biomarker specimens; and D) Behavioral Assessment and Intervention - train interviewers and lay health educators, conduct interviews, design intervention material, and facilitate  communication amongst sites. The Center includes a mechanism for pilot project solicitation, review and funding. This Center has institutional commitment in terms of personnel, funds and space, as well as, a commitment to focus on the problem of health disparities in the region. Finally, members of the team have worked together in the past in various settings that focus on the goals of the proposed Center and have an established relationship in Appalachian Ohio for the purpose of improving the health of the population. Future work of this Center will focus on moving this type of multi-level observational and interventional community-based research, into other areas where health disparities exist in relation to cancer withinour region.

"""Patient Navigation in the SafetyNet: CONNECTeDD""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Despite advances in early detection and treatment options, racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status women continue to suffer advanced stage at diagnosis and higher mortality for both breast and cervical cancer. Delays in diagnosis and treatment, which contribute to poorer outcomes, have been associated with well known barriers to care. These disparities persist despite this knowledge represents a gap between discovery and delivery of cancer care resulting in a pressing need for effective interventions.   The objective of this study is to design, implement and evaluate a patient navigator intervention at six community health centers in Boston, Massachusetts. These sites represents a wide range of racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status women served by an urban safety net institution that mirrors the infrastructure of this country's urban health systems. The intervention is a model based on Andersen's Model of Health Services Use. Aided by an Electronic Medical Record tracking system and theory based cultural competency training, patient navigators will: identify cases, provide service coordination and direct patient support.   Our specific aims are to determine if the intervention will:   1. Reduce time to diagnosis (or resolution of abnormality) after an abnormal mammogram or Pap smear; 2. Reduce time to complete treatment and provide higher quality treatment after a cancer diagnosis; 3. Improve patient satisfaction with health care services; 4. Have critical components (time with patient vs. time coordinating care) which drive its success; 5. Result in more cost-effective care.   We will use a quasi-experimental design with block randomization of six community health centers whose primary affiliation is with Boston Medical Center. Each site will be randomly assigned to either Breast or Cervical Patient Navigation. Thus, each of the Breast intervention sites will serve as a continuous comparison site for the Cervical intervention sites and vice versa.   We expect that the results of this study will inform the design of a generalizable standard, effective and cost efficient patient navigation model that will eliminate barriers to timely, quality cancer care among racial/ethnic minority and lower income populations         ","""Patient Navigation in the SafetyNet: CONNECTeDD""",7686023,U01CA116892,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Range ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resolution ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Scientific Evaluation ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Hospitals ', ' Cervical ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Low Income Population ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Boston ', ' Breast ', ' expectation ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Modeling ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' tv watching ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' safety net ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2008,99978,0.045219341004168245
"Learner Verification of Cervical Cancer Education with Mexican Immigrant Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): (ABSTRACT) Hispanic women in the U.S. have a 50% higher incidence of invasive cervical cancer than non-Hispanic women and Mexicans represent the largest faction of Hispanic immigrants. Findings from a preliminary study showed that elements of cervical cancer educational messages are not relevant to the needs of many Mexican immigrant women; messages are confusing, do not accurately transcend language barriers, do not relate to the women's existing knowledge and experience, and may elicit more fear than motivation. Additionally, aspects of language, reading level, structural format, and visual images within pamphlets pose learning problems for Mexican immigrant women, blocking their comprehension of the message at a fundamental level. The ultimate aim of the proposed research is to increase cervical cancer screening and decrease related morbidity and mortality for Mexican immigrant women. The specific aim of this study is to identify optimal educational presentations of cervical cancer education for this population, through a multi-site learner verification study. Learner verification and revision (LVR), a novel approach for cancer screening promotion, is an interview process to test the suitability of educational material for a targeted audience. In Phase I and II of the two year study, elements of cervical cancer education messages that have been shown to be troublesome for this population will be selected for study. Alternative approaches for presenting these elements will be developed, translated, and piloted, along with LVR interview questions. In Phase III, 45 interviews will be conducted in three cities in the Midwest and Texas, to assess responses of Mexican immigrant women to various presentations of key elements of the cervical cancer education. In Phase IV, findings will be analyzed to determine optimal presentation of key elements of cervical cancer education for Mexican immigrant women. Results of the study will expand the evidence base for culturally and literacy relevant cervical cancer control education for this vulnerable population. The evidence regarding optimal presentation of elements of the cervical cancer educational message can be applied in the development of various educational media formats aimed at decreasing the disparity of cervical cancer incidence in this population, and meeting the goals of Health People 2010. Results of the study will expand the evidence base for culturally and literacy relevant cervical cancer control education for a vulnerable population of Mexican immigrant women. The evidence regarding the effectiveness of presentation of elements of the cervical cancer education message can be applied in all media education formats. Enhanced learner comprehension of cervical cancer prevention education has the potential to decrease costs of suffering and death among Hispanic women, decrease costs of treatment for a largely uninsured population, decrease the disparity of cervical cancer incidence in this population, and aid in meeting the goals of Health People 2010.          ",Learner Verification of Cervical Cancer Education with Mexican Immigrant Women,7458902,R03CA124211,"['literacy ', ' Mexican ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Immigrant ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Anthropology ', ' Population Decreases ', ' Population Growth ', ' Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Sociology ', ' Epistemology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Transcend ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' abstracting ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' response ', ' Uninsured ', ' theories ', ' Cities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cost ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Population ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ', ' ACOG ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cervical Cancer Education ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Comprehension ', ' Prevention education ', ' Future ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Cervical ', ' Site ', ' Invasive ', ' Phase ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Visual ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI KANSAS CITY,R03,2008,74500,0.2003611381818339
"Promoting cancer screening for mothers using a daughter-initiated approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dr. Mosavel's career goal is to establish herself as an independent investigator in cancer control and behavioral research with a focus on African-Americans in low-income neighborhoods. The goal of this application is to integrate a strong mentoring, training, and focused research agenda to enable her to: 1) become an independent health disparities researcher who conducts large scale, community-based behavioral cancer interventions and 2) develop and strengthen her mixed methods skill set to effectively evaluate cancer interventions. The research plan examines the feasibility of the mother and adolescent daughter dyad, particularly from low-income, African-American households, as a unique portal within which to communicate critical cancer prevention and control information. The prevailing health promotion paradigm is that parents give their children advice about health. Consequently, there has been minimal focus on the influence that adolescents can have on their parents' health behaviors. The present study will focus on assessing the daughters' ability to influence their mothers' cancer screening behaviors. There are three specific aims. The first aim is to explore and identify the necessary conditions for effective giving and receiving of breast and cervical cancer information within the mother-daughter dyad. The second aim is to   design the delivery and evaluate the comprehension, credibility and emotional response associated with the daughter-initiated cancer message. Finally, the third aim is to conduct a study of a daughter-focused intervention to examine its effect on mothers' breast and cervical cancer screening behaviors. This study has the potential to utilize the assets of the mother-daughter dyad and promote cancer dialogue in the family. Consequently, a daughter-initiated intervention may have a significant impact on mothers' health behavior. Mothers who receive guided support and encouragement from their daughters may be more responsive to cancer screening messages and more likely to obtain a Pap smear and mammogram when compared to mothers who do not. Likewise, adolescent daughters who are provided with opportunities to discuss cancer prevention may, in turn, grow more knowledgeable and intent on eventually obtaining a Pap smear and mammogram. The proposed research will highlight the conditions that will lead to effective mother-daughter communication about breast and cervical cancer and an understanding of the processes related to this information sharing.

Delays in diagnosis and treatment, which contribute to poorer outcomes, have been associated with well known barriers to care. These disparities persist despite this knowledge represents a gap between discovery and delivery of cancer care resulting in a pressing need for effective interventions.   The objective of this study is to design, implement and evaluate a patient navigator intervention at six community health centers in Boston, Massachusetts. These sites represents a wide range of racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status women served by an urban safety net institution that mirrors the infrastructure of this country's urban health systems. The intervention is a model based on Andersen's Model of Health Services Use. Aided by an Electronic Medical Record tracking system and theory based cultural competency training, patient navigators will: identify cases, provide service coordination and direct patient support.   Our specific aims are to determine if the intervention will:   1. Reduce time to diagnosis (or resolution of abnormality) after an abnormal mammogram or Pap smear; 2. Reduce time to complete treatment and provide higher quality treatment after a cancer diagnosis; 3. Improve patient satisfaction with health care services; 4. Have critical components (time with patient vs. time coordinating care) which drive its success; 5. Result in more cost-effective care.   We will use a quasi-experimental design with block randomization of six community health centers whose primary affiliation is with Boston Medical Center. Each site will be randomly assigned to either Breast or Cervical Patient Navigation. Thus, each of the Breast intervention sites will serve as a continuous comparison site for the Cervical intervention sites and vice versa.   We expect that the results of this study will inform the design of a generalizable standard, effective and cost efficient patient navigation model that will eliminate barriers to timely, quality cancer care among racial/ethnic minority and lower income populations         ","""Patient Navigation in the SafetyNet: CONNECTeDD""",7496489,U01CA116892,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Range ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resolution ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Scientific Evaluation ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Hospitals ', ' Cervical ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Low Income Population ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Boston ', ' Breast ', ' expectation ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Modeling ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' tv watching ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' safety net ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2008,799392,0.045219341004168245
"REACH UP & OUT: Eliminating Breast and Cervical Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been well documented that disparities exist between African American and white women with regard to morbidity and mortality associated with breast and cervical cancer. We have established a very active coalition, conducted comprehensive needs assessments, and developed and pilot-tested a community action plan to reduce breast and cervical cancer screening disparities between white and African American women in Alabama's Black Belt. Although effective and well received by the community, this intervention did not lead to behavior change among all women within the targeted population. The overall purpose of the proposed intervention is to further reduce breast and cervical cancer disparities between white and African American women in the Black Belt of Alabama by increasing Pap smear and mammography rates. We propose to develop and implement a multi-component intervention that uses media, education, and enhanced access, incorporating sociological and cognitive behavioral approaches in the development and implementation of the messages. This intervention is an extension of our pilot work utilizing community health advisors (CHAs) (sociologic approach). Although the pilot intervention showed significant increase in breast and cervical cancer screening among African American women in the Black Belt, there is still a hard to-reach group, which, despite our efforts, has not engaged in breast and cervical cancer screening. Based on the results of follow-up interviews with this group of women and discussions with our coalition members and CHAs, we propose the development, implementation, and evaluation of an enhanced intervention, which incorporates cognitive behavioral approaches that will challenge the barriers (e.g., fear of finding out they have cancer, the belief that screening will not make any difference) and reinforce the motivators (e.g., support from other women) to engage this group in breast and cervical cancer screening. Although the Community-Based Participatory Research and the Empowerment Model will be the overall conceptual framework used in this study, the PEN-3 and the Health Belief Model will guide intervention development and implementation. The intervention counties will receive education and cognitive/behavioral skills training delivered by CHAs, while the control counties will continue to receive our current intervention that has proven to be successful. The study will be carried out in two phases. In Phase I, we will refine the enhanced intervention and assessment tools through formative assessment. In Phase II, we will randomly assign the counties to intervention/control groups, implement, and evaluate the intervention.          ",REACH UP & OUT: Eliminating Breast and Cervical Cancer Disparities,7491951,R24MD002747,"['Data Reporting ', ' Purpose ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health behavior ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Alabama ', ' Phase ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Logic ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Funding ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' tool ', ' Condition ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Appendix ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' skills training ', ' American ', ' Breast ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' County ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Community Actions ', ' community intervention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R24,2008,580000,0.1337166819008851
"HPV in Heterosexual Couples    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Introduction: As effective human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines become available, epidemiologic research on HPV and cervical cancer will continue to be important: vaccine uptake will not be immediate or universal, and vaccines will not initially target all oncogenic types; furthermore, gains in knowledge may be relevant for other cancers. Methods: We have a time-sensitive opportunity to add substantially to our understanding of HPV transmission between young, high-risk heterosexual partners, and to clarify the controversial role of condom use and male circumcision, by adding an HPV sub-study to ""Dual STI Prevention Interventions for Minority Couples"", a randomized controlled trial of a cognitive-behavioral intervention to reduce sexually transmitted infections (STI). This study is currently enrolling 500 minority heterosexual couples; all women have non-viral STI at baseline. All 1000 individuals will be followed for one year, with specimen collection and detailed interviews at baseline, six months, and twelve months followup. For the proposed R03 project, ""HPV in Heterosexual Couples"", we will collect genital swab samples, and blood samples, from men and women in the parent study. These samples will provide a unique resource for an R01-scale study to evaluate transmission dynamics of HPV in a high-risk population of heterosexual minority couples. We have already submitted an R01 application to conduct genital HPV DNA typing and viral load for males and females; conduct serologic testing for HPV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 for males and females; assess cervical inflammation for females; and conduct detailed statistical analyses. We are also submitting the current R03 application, in light of the possibility that the R01 may not immediately be funded. Outcomes: The major contribution of this project will be to create a valuable bank of stored specimens. These specimens can be used in the future to shed light on heterosexual transmission of HPV, and factors affecting probability of transmission. In particular, we will be able to assess the role of male circumcision, the impact of condoms using extremely detailed behavioral data, the impact of concurrent STIs in either partner, and HPV viral load in the infecting partner. This study of ethnic minorities is a cost- effective way to answer current questions about factors affecting HPV transmission between heterosexual couples. Relevance: The proposed sample collection will provide the basis for future analyses to significantly increase our understanding of heterosexual transmission of HPV in a young, high-risk minority population. We will be able to elucidate the impact of condoms, male circumcision, and concurrent STIs, as well as help to shed light on ethnic disparities in cervical cancer risk.           ",HPV in

"Communication Inequalities on HPV, Cervical Cancer, and the HPV Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Research indicates that human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted infection that causes over 70% of cervical cancer cases, disproportionately affects Black women and women of African descent in the United States. Concomitantly, research shows that a ""knowledge gap"" exists, whereby Black women are significantly less likely to have heard of HPV than their White counterparts. Inadequate access to culturally appropriate health and cancer information may not only reduce racial/ethnic minority women's HPV awareness, but may hinder their abilities to utilize information to prevent and reduce HPV and cervical cancer risks. The proposed study will identify and document the communication needs around HPV infection and vaccination among low-socioeconomic position (SEP) Black women who are primary caregivers of young women and girls aged 7-20.       Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, we will work collaboratively with our community partner, Boston REACH 2010 Breast and Cervical Cancer Coalition (Boston REACH 2010 Coalition) to develop and conduct focus groups that will help to assess HPV and vaccination communication needs to raise community awareness. These activities should prove very useful in strategic communication and outreach with low -SEP Black women in Boston. Along with focus groups, we will systematically disseminate our findings to the Boston REACH 2010 partners, as well as the broader MassCONECT communities, through community-based workshops.       The goal of this study is to identify and target HPV communication barriers for low-SEP racial/ethnic minority women in order to reduce HPV and cervical cancer health disparities among this group.             ","Communication Inequalities on HPV, Cervical Cancer, and the HPV Vaccine",7459190,U01CA114644,"['aged ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Radio ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ', ' DF/HCC ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Information and Media ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' minority health ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Teaching Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Health Campaign ', ' racism ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' African ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Inequality ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mass Media ', ' mass information media ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Knowledge ', ' Television ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Awareness ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Boston ', ' Breast ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' outreach ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Friends ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Personal Communication ', ' Interpersonal Communication ', ' girls ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Information Technology ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Minority ', ' vaccine safety ', ' ']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,U01,2008,80117,0.24708086713423744
"Cervical Cancer Screening in Lesbians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates have decreased significantly during the last 50 years due to widespread screening with the Papanicolaou (Pap) test. However, subgroups of women continue to be at elevated risk of cervical cancer due to underutilization of screening services. Lesbians are an underserved group of women who participate in routine cervical cancer screening at rates below below recommended rates and below that of the general population of women. Failure to be screened is of great importance for these women because inadequate screening may lead to later diagnosis, diagnosis of more advanced disease, greater morbidity and mortality, and thus, disproportionate burden of disease for this subgroup of women. The primary aim of this proposal is to identify factors associated with participation in routine cervical cancer screening in lesbians based on constructs from the Health Belief and PRECEDE-PROCEED models. Factors that will be explored include: knowledge of cervical cancer risk factors and screening guidelines; perceived susceptibility, barriers, and benefits of cervical cancer screening; and cues to action (e.g., physician recommendation for Pap). We will also explorate contextual factors that are unique to lesbians and are related to cervical cancer screening behavior; factors that will be explored will include: perceived discrimination, insurance status, experiences in health care settings, and differing reproductive health care needs of lesbians. We hypothesize that compared to lesbians who participate in routine screening, lesbians that do not participate in routine cervical cancer screening will: (1)be less knowledgeable about cervical cancer risk factors and guidelines; (2)have lower perceived susceptibility to cervical cancer, and perceive greater barriers; (3)perceive fewer benefits to screening; and (4)be less likely to receive physician recommendation for Pap test. We propose a cross-sectional study of approximately 1,000 self-identified lesbians randomly selected from a large pool of internet survey respondents maintained by Harris Interactive. The proposed study will use Internet survey methodology. Successful completion of this study will contribute to the public health objective of increasing women's overall rates of participation in cervical cancer screening-a Healthy People 2010 objective-- and allow us to design an intervention to address barriers to screening in lesbians and increase their adherence to recommended screening guidelines. Lesbians are an underserved, understudied group of women who may be at greater risk for cervical cancer due to their health habits, perceptions, and behaviors. Reducing cancer disparities in underserved groups of women is a major public health objective outlined in the Healthy People 2010 plan. The proposed study will allow us to identify critical barriers to Pap screening in lesbians and to use these findings to design an intervention to address barriers to screening in order to increase rates of screening in this underserved group of women.             ",Cervical Cancer Screening in Lesbians,7484206,R21CA120635,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cues ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Subgroup ', ' Rate ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medical ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Incidence ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Lesbian ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Respondent ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Nature ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Woman ', ' Behavior ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Visit ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Misinformation ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Uninsured ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2008,120000,0.24311584968325872
"Cervical Cancer Beliefs in Ethnic Subgroups of Latina Immigrants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has highlighted the higher incidence, prevalence, and disproportionately high mortality rates of cervical cancer among Hispanic women (Latinas) compared to non-Hispanic whites in the U.S., signaling health disparities and the need for innovative approaches. Effective community-based interventions are needed to address these health disparities, but the development of such interventions are limited by gaps in our understanding of: 1) Hispanic beliefs toward cervical cancer and HPV depending on country of origin, and 2) culturally specific curriculum designed for community health worker (promotora) programs working with these subpopulation groups. The current application extends previous research suggesting that education and outreach programs have to address cultural beliefs in order to be effective. This collaborative, ethnographic pilot study aims to address cervical cancer disparities by partnering with a rural, Hispanic-serving community organization in order to conduct a cross-cultural examination of Hispanic beliefs toward cervical cancer and HPV. The findings will inform the development of curriculum modules on cervical cancer and HPV designed to be used by a promotora de salud (lay health adviser) intervention program. The specific aims are: 1) to explore levels of knowledge, cultural attitudes, perceptions of risk of cervical cancer and HPV, and screening behaviors with Hispanic subpopulations using ethnographic methods; and 2) to develop a pilot curriculum module on cervical cancer and HPV targeted to promotoras, infused with the ethnographic findings from Phase I. As the Hispanic immigrant population increases in the U.S., there is a growing recognition that interventions need to be tailored to Hispanics of different national origins and education levels. By gathering information on knowledge, risk perceptions, and cultural attitudes among various subgroups, culturally tailored public health outreach efforts can be targeted and potentially be more effective for impacting cervical cancer disparities in groups suffering the greatest burden of the disease. Systematic ethnographic research techniques are proposed to explore the knowledge, risk perceptions, and cultural attitudes of Hispanics toward cervical cancer and HPV in order to develop culturally and literacy-level appropriate educational interventions. Cultural consensus analysis will elicit cultural models of cognitive beliefs toward cervical cancer to collectively inform a comprehensive educational approach. This study is novel in that it 1) utilizes systematic ethnographic research techniques to develop curriculum modules on cervical cancer targeted to a diverse Hispanic audience, 2) recruits Hispanic CNA students to pilot the curriculum modules and introduces them to cancer outreach activities.

"Translating an Efficaious HPV Vaccine into the Control of Cervical Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The FDA approval in summer 2006 of an efficacious human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine provides an unprecedented opportunity for the primary prevention of cervical cancer. However, little is known about how to effectively deliver this vaccine to those most likely to benefit from its use: medically underserved pre- adolescent females. To translate this breakthrough into reduced cervical cancer incidence rates in the underserved, we must first take steps to enhance the likelihood that medically underserved teen and preteen females receive the HPV vaccine. The objective of this proposal is to gain information to develop effective educational interventions and then develop the intervention. To achieve this objective, we propose to address the following specific aims: 1) To conduct formative, qualitative research to identify factors that act as barriers to vaccines in general and to HPV vaccination in particular in medically underserved communities, especially among parents and pre- adolescent and early adolescent females. 2) To plan and develop an educational intervention to enhance informed decision-making in underserved communities concerning HPV vaccine delivery to pre-adolescent/early adolescent females. Using focus group methodology, we will characterize similarities and differences in perception of HPV vaccination in multiple groups of African Americans, Latinos, and white Americans. Focus groups will be conducted among both adult community stakeholders and pre-adolescent/adolescent females to assess inter- generational differences in perceptions. Comparisons of results between racial/ethnic groups will allow us to determine the value of tailoring subsequent interventions. This project addresses a timely, novel research topic that is translational by disseminating a scientific breakthrough to the general population to advance the public's health. This work will be carried out by a highly-qualified interdisciplinary research team, will address racial/ethnic disparities in the burden of cervical cancer, and will form the basis for a subsequent R01 to test interventions that will ultimately contribute to a U.S. model for cervical cancer control. The quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been shown to virtually prevent 70% of cervical cancers when given to preteen girls. Information about the vaccine and its utilization are critical components in making the prevention of cervical cancer a reality. Understanding barriers and misperceptions that underserved communities have concerning the vaccine and cervical cancer will enable researchers to develop and test educational interventions that are ethnically and culturally effective and that ultimately enable vaccine acceptance.           Narrative The quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been shown to virtually prevent 70% of cervical cancers when given to preteen girls.

"A Multicultural, Multilingual HPV Vaccine Education DVD for Diverse Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a multicultural, multilingual DVD designed to promote health literacy about the HPV vaccine and foster informed HPV immunization decisions among parents of girls and girls ages 9-17 at high risk for HPV infection: Koreans, Vietnamese, Filipinos, African Americans, Latinos and low-income whites. This study will focus on one of those target populations: Latinos. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) identify HPV vaccine literacy levels, attitudes, perceptions and information sources among parents of girls 9-17 old, (2) identify cultural values, beliefs, and practices that influence attention, comprehension, perception and evaluation of HPV vaccine information intended to inform an immunization decision, (3) identify specific themes, message elements and communication strategies for a patient-centered intervention that enhances comprehension of the risks and benefits of the vaccine and its health implications to adequately inform an immunization decision, (4) assess the accessibility of DVD technology and its acceptability as the medium for an HPV vaccine education intervention to parents of preadolescent girls and adolescent girls and (5) develop a prototype DVD to asses the feasibility using this medium to deliver comprehensible, culturally competent, health literacy information on HPV immunization. The HHS Initiative to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities calls attention to the gaps in access to preventive health resources, principally among racial and ethnic minorities. This study to assess the feasibility of developing a multicultural, multilingual HPV education intervention through DVD technology responds to the National Cancer Institute's program on Interactive Media Technologies in Cancer Prevention, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control to promote the use of innovative media technology and/or communication approaches in cancer prevention and control applications used in medical and community settings. The study employs focus groups and cognitive interviews to identify cognitive and affective factors that impede or promote an informed HPV immunization decision. It will accrue 64 Latina parents of preadolescent girls and 64 Latina adolescent girls ages 13-17 from urban and rural settings to participate in 12 focus groups and 32 individual interviews; half of the focus groups and interviews will be conducted in Spanish. Focus group data collection will be augment through the use of a short questionnaire to obtain qualitative data regarding knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and prior behaviors related to HPV, cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This health literacy study addresses the need for multilingual, multicultural, HPV vaccine education materials to empower individuals at high risk for HPV infection to make an informed immunization decision, which offers a significant public health benefit.                 Project Narrative This health literacy study addresses the need for multilingual, multicultural, HPV vaccine education materials to empower individuals at high risk for HPV infection to make an informed immunization decision, which offers a significant public health benefit.","A Multicultural, Multilingual HPV Vaccine Education DVD for Diverse Populations",7801938,R43MD005198,"['Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Health Educators ', ' Provider ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Division of Cancer Prevention ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Cognitive ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Text ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Comprehension ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' HPV-High Risk ', ' High risk Human papilloma virus ', ' High risk Human Papillomavirus ', ' High risk HPV ', ' High Risk Oncogenic HPV ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Group Practice ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Infection ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' literacy ', ' Filipino ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' Licensing ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Marketing ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Parents ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Asses ', ' Equus asinus ', ' Donkey ', ' Printing ', ' tool ', ' Koreans ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Solutions ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Vaccines ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' trafficking ', ' cultural values ', ' technological innovation ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Devices ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' girls ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' phase I trial ', ' phase I protocol ', ' phase 1 trial ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Affective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' commercial application ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' ']",NIMHD,VALDEZ AND ASSOCIATES,R43,2009,93448,0.13829857008003948

"""Patient Navigation in the SafetyNet: CONNECTeDD""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Despite advances in early detection and treatment options, racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status women continue to suffer advanced stage at diagnosis and higher mortality for both breast and cervical cancer. Delays in diagnosis and treatment, which contribute to poorer outcomes, have been associated with well known barriers to care. These disparities persist despite this knowledge represents a gap between discovery and delivery of cancer care resulting in a pressing need for effective interventions.   The objective of this study is to design, implement and evaluate a patient navigator intervention at six community health centers in Boston, Massachusetts. These sites represents a wide range of racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status women served by an urban safety net institution that mirrors the infrastructure of this country's urban health systems. The intervention is a model based on Andersen's Model of Health Services Use. Aided by an Electronic Medical Record tracking system and theory based cultural competency training, patient navigators will: identify cases, provide service coordination and direct patient support.   Our specific aims are to determine if the intervention will:   1. Reduce time to diagnosis (or resolution of abnormality) after an abnormal mammogram or Pap smear; 2. Reduce time to complete treatment and provide higher quality treatment after a cancer diagnosis; 3. Improve patient satisfaction with health care services; 4. Have critical components (time with patient vs. time coordinating care) which drive its success; 5. Result in more cost-effective care.   We will use a quasi-experimental design with block randomization of six community health centers whose primary affiliation is with Boston Medical Center. Each site will be randomly assigned to either Breast or Cervical Patient Navigation. Thus, each of the Breast intervention sites will serve as a continuous comparison site for the Cervical intervention sites and vice versa.

"Determinants of Participation in an Anal Cancer Prevention Trial    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (05) Comparative effectiveness research (CER) and specific Challenge Topic, 05-CA-102* Comparative Effectiveness Research on Cancer Screening. The project, ""Determinants of participation in an anal cancer prevention trial"" is designed to provide information that will be critical to the performance of a pivotal randomized clinical trial of screening and treatment of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) to prevent anal cancer. Anal cancer is a growing problem in the United States. Increasing by approximately 2 percent per year among both men and women in the general population, it is particularly common among certain high-risk groups such as HIV-positive men and women. Among HIV-positive individuals, the incidence of anal cancer has continued to increase despite the availability of effective anti-retroviral therapy (ART). The current incidence of anal cancer among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) may be as high as 137/100,000, or more than 10 times the current incidence of cervical cancer in the screened population of women in the U.S., and is higher than the highest incidence of cervical cancer in unscreened populations of women world-wide. The incidence of anal cancer is almost 7-fold higher among HIV-positive women compared with the general population. Like cervical cancer, anal cancer is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) and is preceded by a series of precancerous changes known as anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). The incidence of cervical cancer has been sharply reduced by screening with cervical cytology to identify women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which is then treated to prevent progression to cancer. Like cervical cancer anal cancer may be preventable through treatment of the anal equivalent, high-grade AIN (HGAIN). The combination of an unacceptably high incidence of anal cancer with the likelihood that anal cancer is preventable calls for urgent intervention. At this time however, there are no formal guidelines recommending anal screening and treatment of HGAIN. This is because no studies have yet been done to demonstrate that screening for and treatment of HGAIN reduced the incidence of anal cancer. The USPHS guidelines for the care of HIV-positive individuals currently state that ""anal cytology screening of HIV-seropositive MSM and of women may be useful preventive measures. However, studies of screening and treatment programs for AIN 2 or 3 need to be implemented before definitive recommendations for anal cytology screening can be made"". This application will provide critical information that will support the conduct of such a study, namely determinants of participation in a randomized clinical trial in which 50 percent of participants with HGAIN will be screened and treated, and 50 percent will be observed without treatment. At the end of a 5-year period, the number of anal cancer cases will be compared in both arms. Given the complexities of the underlying clinical issues that might govern willingness to participate, the increasing proportion of underrepresented minorities that comprise the HIV epidemic and the varying issues around participation that each of these racial/ethnic groups might have, a rigorous study to measure these determinants in geographically and racially/ethnically diverse groups that comprise the HIV epidemic in the U.S. is critical. The specific aims of this application are therefore to: 1. To identify and assess the determinants of provider willingness to refer eligible participants; 2. To identify and assess the determinants of patient willingness and motivation to participate in the RCT; and 3. To determine the optimum study design and sample size, and recruitment strategies based on the analysis of data from Aims 1 and 2. This application is responsive to this challenge topic in which data from earlier observational studies would be augmented with physician and patient acceptability data to permit the pivotal RCT to proceed. Although the results of the RCT will set standard of care for HIV-positive men and women, they will also have wide implications beyond that of the HIV-positive population. The results will guide screening and treatment for HIV-negative populations as well, and the study will provide a biobank of clinical specimens that will be invaluable to understanding molecular determinants of progression from anal intraepithelial neoplasia to anal cancer. These results will also be applicable to understanding the factors underlying progression to cervical cancer, and will be particularly important since assembly of such as biobank of women at risk for cervical cancer would be currently impossible given that the standard of care is to treat high-grade CIN to prevent cervical cancer. Finally, this study will have broad influence by informing strategies to enhance participation in clinical studies by underrepresented minority groups. 7. Project Narrative (for lay audience) The incidence of anal cancer among people with HIV is higher than cervical cancer was before routine cervical cytology screening was introduced, but unlike cervical cancer, there are currently no screening recommendations in place for anal cancer. The proposed focus group/survey study will be essential to planning a large definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) in HIV-positive men and women to test whether treatment of anal cancer precursors identified through anal cytology screening can prevent anal cancer. The RCT planned with the assistance of this proposed study will set the standard of care for HIV- positive men and women, but will also have wide implications for screening and treatment for HIV- negative populations, as well as understanding the factors underlying progression to cervical and anal cancer.                  7.

"Cervical Cancer Beliefs in Ethnic Subgroups of Latina Immigrants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has highlighted the higher incidence, prevalence, and disproportionately high mortality rates of cervical cancer among Hispanic women (Latinas) compared to non-Hispanic whites in the U.S., signaling health disparities and the need for innovative approaches. Effective community-based interventions are needed to address these health disparities, but the development of such interventions are limited by gaps in our understanding of: 1) Hispanic beliefs toward cervical cancer and HPV depending on country of origin, and 2) culturally specific curriculum designed for community health worker (promotora) programs working with these subpopulation groups. The current application extends previous research suggesting that education and outreach programs have to address cultural beliefs in order to be effective. This collaborative, ethnographic pilot study aims to address cervical cancer disparities by partnering with a rural, Hispanic-serving community organization in order to conduct a cross-cultural examination of Hispanic beliefs toward cervical cancer and HPV. The findings will inform the development of curriculum modules on cervical cancer and HPV designed to be used by a promotora de salud (lay health adviser) intervention program. The specific aims are: 1) to explore levels of knowledge, cultural attitudes, perceptions of risk of cervical cancer and HPV, and screening behaviors with Hispanic subpopulations using ethnographic methods; and 2) to develop a pilot curriculum module on cervical cancer and HPV targeted to promotoras, infused with the ethnographic findings from Phase I. As the Hispanic immigrant population increases in the U.S., there is a growing recognition that interventions need to be tailored to Hispanics of different national origins and education levels. By gathering information on knowledge, risk perceptions, and cultural attitudes among various subgroups, culturally tailored public health outreach efforts can be targeted and potentially be more effective for impacting cervical cancer disparities in groups suffering the greatest burden of the disease. Systematic ethnographic research techniques are proposed to explore the knowledge, risk perceptions, and cultural attitudes of Hispanics toward cervical cancer and HPV in order to develop culturally and literacy-level appropriate educational interventions. Cultural consensus analysis will elicit cultural models of cognitive beliefs toward cervical cancer to collectively inform a comprehensive educational approach. This study is novel in that it 1) utilizes systematic ethnographic research techniques to develop curriculum modules on cervical cancer targeted to a diverse Hispanic audience, 2) recruits Hispanic CNA students to pilot the curriculum modules and introduces them to cancer outreach activities. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 1 Continuation Format Page                 Project Narrative A better understanding of knowledge, risk perceptions, and cultural attitudes among various Hispanic subgroups around cervical cancer may be helpful in developing more effective outreach efforts and impacting cervical cancer disparities in groups suffering the greatest burden of the disease, thereby improving public health. Additionally, ethnographic research methods are uniquely suited to elicit these cultural domains around cancer. The proposed study will examine Hispanic beliefs toward cervical cancer and HPV.

"Promoting cancer screening for mothers using a daughter-initiated approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dr. Mosavel's career goal is to establish herself as an independent investigator in cancer control and behavioral research with a focus on African-Americans in low-income neighborhoods. The goal of this application is to integrate a strong mentoring, training, and focused research agenda to enable her to: 1) become an independent health disparities researcher who conducts large scale, community-based behavioral cancer interventions and 2) develop and strengthen her mixed methods skill set to effectively evaluate cancer interventions. The research plan examines the feasibility of the mother and adolescent daughter dyad, particularly from low-income, African-American households, as a unique portal within which to communicate critical cancer prevention and control information. The prevailing health promotion paradigm is that parents give their children advice about health. Consequently, there has been minimal focus on the influence that adolescents can have on their parents' health behaviors. The present study will focus on assessing the daughters' ability to influence their mothers' cancer screening behaviors. There are three specific aims. The first aim is to explore and identify the necessary conditions for effective giving and receiving of breast and cervical cancer information within the mother-daughter dyad. The second aim is to   design the delivery and evaluate the comprehension, credibility and emotional response associated with the daughter-initiated cancer message. Finally, the third aim is to conduct a study of a daughter-focused intervention to examine its effect on mothers' breast and cervical cancer screening behaviors. This study has the potential to utilize the assets of the mother-daughter dyad and promote cancer dialogue in the family. Consequently, a daughter-initiated intervention may have a significant impact on mothers' health behavior. Mothers who receive guided support and encouragement from their daughters may be more responsive to cancer screening messages and more likely to obtain a Pap smear and mammogram when compared to mothers who do not. Likewise, adolescent daughters who are provided with opportunities to discuss cancer prevention may, in turn, grow more knowledgeable and intent on eventually obtaining a Pap smear and mammogram. The proposed research will highlight the conditions that will lead to effective mother-daughter communication about breast and cervical cancer and an understanding of the processes related to this information sharing. Finally, the findings from the proposed research will lead to subsequent R21 and R01 community-based cancer intervention research.             ",Promoting cancer screening for mothers using a daughter-initiated approach,7658242,K01CA132960,"['Daughter ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Comprehension ', ' Intention ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Household Heads ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Household ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' African ', ' Literature ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Motivation ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Parents ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Breast ', ' skills ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Emotional ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' parental influence ', ' parent influence ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,K01,2009,26191,0.09332401619075449
"REACH UP & OUT: Eliminating Breast and Cervical Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been well documented that disparities exist between African American and white women with regard to morbidity and mortality associated with breast and cervical cancer. We have established a very active coalition, conducted comprehensive needs assessments, and developed and pilot-tested a community action plan to reduce breast and cervical cancer screening disparities between white and African American women in Alabama's Black Belt. Although effective and well received by the community, this intervention did not lead to behavior change among all women within the targeted population. The overall purpose of the proposed intervention is to further reduce breast and cervical cancer disparities between white and African American women in the Black Belt of Alabama by increasing Pap smear and mammography rates. We propose to develop and implement a multi-component intervention that uses media, education, and enhanced access, incorporating sociological and cognitive behavioral approaches in the development and implementation of the messages. This intervention is an extension of our pilot work utilizing community health advisors (CHAs) (sociologic approach). Although the pilot intervention showed significant increase in breast and cervical cancer screening among African American women in the Black Belt, there is still a hard to-reach group, which, despite our efforts, has not engaged in breast and cervical cancer screening. Based on the results of follow-up interviews with this group of women and discussions with our coalition members and CHAs, we propose the development, implementation, and evaluation of an enhanced intervention, which incorporates cognitive behavioral approaches that will challenge the barriers (e.g., fear of finding out they have cancer, the belief that screening will not make any difference) and reinforce the motivators (e.g., support from other women) to engage this group in breast and cervical cancer screening. Although the Community-Based Participatory Research and the Empowerment Model will be the overall conceptual framework used in this study, the PEN-3 and the Health Belief Model will guide intervention development and implementation. The intervention counties will receive education and cognitive/behavioral skills training delivered by CHAs, while the control counties will continue to receive our current intervention that has proven to be successful. The study will be carried out in two phases. In Phase I, we will refine the enhanced intervention and assessment tools through formative assessment. In Phase II, we will randomly assign the counties to intervention/control groups, implement, and evaluate the intervention.          ",REACH UP & OUT: Eliminating Breast and Cervical Cancer Disparities,7628493,R24MD002747,"['Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' base ', ' Alabama ', ' Phase ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' tool ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Belief ', ' behavior change ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' skills training ', ' Breast ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' County ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Community Actions ', ' community intervention ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R24,2009,579801,0.1337166819008851
"Reducing Health Disparities: Survey Validation for Black, Latina and Arab Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A critical undertaking in designing research interventions that study effective ways to reduce health disparities among racial/ethnic and underserved women is to have instruments that are linguistically and culturally appropriate and that have been validated for use in those specific populations. Health literacy is increasingly recognized as an important variable and related to breast and cervical cancer disparities. However, the current health literacy measurement tools are not sufficient to assess a woman's functional cancer literacy. In this developmental phase of our research, our goal is to determine the psychometric properties of two newly created measures of cancer literacy. The cancer literacy assessment tools (CLAT) will measure a woman's functional understanding of breast and cervical cancer. This research will produce two instruments for use in English, Spanish and Arabic women for measuring a women's functional understanding of breast and cervical cancer. The instruments will be validated with Black, Latina and Arab women, within the context of a female-family home-based educational intervention. Working with a recruitment model we have used successfully in prior research, we will recruit women who are connected with established public health programs who will serve as liaisons by recruiting other females in their families to take the cancer literacy assessments. Qualitative and quantitative analysis will be used to produce two instruments with good psychometric properties, including reliability, cross cultural measurement invariance, and predictive validity. Measurement invariance including identification of differential item functioning (DIF) will be established using multigroup structural equation modeling with means structures. Multilevel modeling will be used to take the hierarchical nature of the sampling into account. By having baseline cancer literacy measures, this research study will be increasing the capacity of the community of science and public health agencies to more effectively design interventions that promote screening and early detection among women who are at high risk for breast and cervical cancer mortality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this research will directly impact public health agencies and research on planning and intervention design; as to more effectively promote breast and cervical screening and early detection for medically underserved women. This will be done by providing a baseline measure for cancer literacy in three groups of women, Black, Latina and Arab, who are disproportionately affected by breast and cervical cancer mortality.                       Project Narrative Results from this research will directly impact public health agencies and research on planning and intervention design; as to more effectively promote breast and cervical screening and early detection for medically underserved women.

"Cervical Cancer Beliefs in Ethnic Subgroups of Latina Immigrants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has highlighted the higher incidence, prevalence, and disproportionately high mortality rates of cervical cancer among Hispanic women (Latinas) compared to non-Hispanic whites in the U.S., signaling health disparities and the need for innovative approaches. Effective community-based interventions are needed to address these health disparities, but the development of such interventions are limited by gaps in our understanding of: 1) Hispanic beliefs toward cervical cancer and HPV depending on country of origin, and 2) culturally specific curriculum designed for community health worker (promotora) programs working with these subpopulation groups. The current application extends previous research suggesting that education and outreach programs have to address cultural beliefs in order to be effective. This collaborative, ethnographic pilot study aims to address cervical cancer disparities by partnering with a rural, Hispanic-serving community organization in order to conduct a cross-cultural examination of Hispanic beliefs toward cervical cancer and HPV. The findings will inform the development of curriculum modules on cervical cancer and HPV designed to be used by a promotora de salud (lay health adviser) intervention program. The specific aims are: 1) to explore levels of knowledge, cultural attitudes, perceptions of risk of cervical cancer and HPV, and screening behaviors with Hispanic subpopulations using ethnographic methods; and 2) to develop a pilot curriculum module on cervical cancer and HPV targeted to promotoras, infused with the ethnographic findings from Phase I. As the Hispanic immigrant population increases in the U.S., there is a growing recognition that interventions need to be tailored to Hispanics of different national origins and education levels. By gathering information on knowledge, risk perceptions, and cultural attitudes among various subgroups, culturally tailored public health outreach efforts can be targeted and potentially be more effective for impacting cervical cancer disparities in groups suffering the greatest burden of the disease. Systematic ethnographic research techniques are proposed to explore the knowledge, risk perceptions, and cultural attitudes of Hispanics toward cervical cancer and HPV in order to develop culturally and literacy-level appropriate educational interventions. Cultural consensus analysis will elicit cultural models of cognitive beliefs toward cervical cancer to collectively inform a comprehensive educational approach. This study is novel in that it 1) utilizes systematic ethnographic research techniques to develop curriculum modules on cervical cancer targeted to a diverse Hispanic audience, 2) recruits Hispanic CNA students to pilot the curriculum modules and introduces them to cancer outreach activities.

"HPV Outcomes: Prevention Epidemiology and Surveillance (HOPES) New Mexico (NM) is the only state with the capacity to fully monitor cervical cancer screening and human  papillomavirus (HPV) prevention using a state-wide woman-based electronic informatics system under  mandated reporting. We are uniquely positioned to address gaps in understanding HPV vaccine impact and  effectiveness within a mulit-cultural US population suffering many disparities. Our project will accomplish  three integrated specific aims required to provide definitive baseline characterizations of the opportunistic  cervical cancer screening program in NM. In Aim 1, we will establish the individual HPV genotype distribution  of 37 HPV genotypes needed to appropriately monitor expected or unexpected population-based impact of  HPV vaccines. Although we have performed a state-wide sampling of over 60,000 cervical samples  targeting all women with abnormal Pap tests and a random sample of women with normal Pap tests, our  existing resources were limited to HPV genoytping of 40,000 samples. In this Aim we will achieve the  targeted sample size by performing the additional 20,000 HPV genotype assays.We will describe the agespecific  population-based genotype distribution and determine the genotype-specific risk for CIN2+  outcomes across the 2 year grant period. In Aim 2, we will convene a pathology panel to determine  consensus diagnoses for ~8,000 cervical biopsies including >CIN/AIS. The consensus diagnoses will be  compared to community-based diagnoses determined for the same specimens through use of the NM HPV  Pap Registry (NMHPVPR) data warehouse. We will create a gold standard slide set that will enable  standardization of future population-based assessments, a prerequisite for determining the real-world impact  and effectiveness of HPV vaccination. In Aim 3 we will develop a shared image resource of the cervical  biopsy tissues and validate the use of image-based versus glass-based diagnoses. Because the impact of  HPV vaccines is expected to increase over time, longitudinal periodic assessments will be expected to span  several decades. Image-based diagnostic standards will be critical to future population evaluations. In the interest of the health of all women, we will establish the population-basedprevalence of HPV  genotypes, HPV-related cervical abnormalities and establish a model of opportunistic cervical cancer  screening in the United States.

"Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening in Obese Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate's long-term career goal is to understand how primary medical care impacts cancer outcomes and to develop interventions that will improve primary medical care in this regard.  Primary medical care is important in helping to decrease cancer incidence and mortality and to understand the causes of health disparities in cancer stage and survival.  UMDNJ- New Jersey Medical School, located in Newark, New Jersey is surrounded by a community affected by heavier burdens of cancer incidence, late stage cancer at diagnosis, and cancer mortality.  The adjacent counties surrounding the school contain 27.3 % of New Jersey's total population, but 52.4% of its African-American population and 49.7% of the state's Hispanic population.  This population is ideal for studying the causes of late stage cancer diagnosis and racial disparities in cancer stage and survival.  In collaboration with the Cancer Institute of New Jersey, the institution is developing, as a top priority, research and clinical programs to address deficits in cancer care in northern New Jersey and major health disparities evident in Newark and its environs.  The PI's career objectives of this proposal are to increase quantitative skills in data analysis, to refine skills in survey research, to learn qualitative research methods, and to learn how to integrate culture, language, and literacy into cancer control interventions.  The research career development plan includes: completion of a Masters in Public Health degree program, the NCI's ""Principles and Practice of Cancer Prevention and Control Course,"" a review course on SAS statistical software, a training course on SUDAAN Statistical Software, completion of the Cancer, Culture, and Literacy Institute, various other cancer and research forums, and the conduct of mentored multi-method research.      This multi-method research project will focus on breast and cervical cancer screening in an at risk subpopulation: obese women.  Obese women are more likely than nonobese women to be delayed in breast and cervical cancer screening.  Since African-American and Hispanic women are disproportionately obese compared to other races, this study may impact racial disparities in cancer.  First, new analyses will be conducted using data from the National Health Interview Survey to quantify the extent of the association of obesity to delayed cancer screening, and the impact of race/ethnicity and comorbidity on this association.  Next, focus groups will be conducted with obese women to identify their barriers to cancer screening.  In addition, in-depth interviews and a mail survey will be administered to physicians to identify their barriers to cancer screening in obese women and to elicit suggestions to overcome those barriers.  Finally, an interventional plan and materials will be developed that are appropriate for a multicultural target group and evaluated for appropriateness, readability, and feasibility through focus groups of patients and physicians.

"University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Over 6 million new cases of sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPVs) infections are reported every year making HPV the most common sexually transmitted agent world-wide. At least 15 carcinogenic HPV types cause virtually all cervical cancers however; the costly HPV vaccine licensed in 2006 covers only HPV types 6/11/16/18 and has no therapeutic effect on established infections. Thus all women must continue routine cervical screening at a US cost of $4-5 billion annually. More importantly, the majority of women alive today are still at risk for developing cervical cancer. In addition, the current vaccine program presently leaves all men unprotected. Given these considerations and the fact that cervical cancer is a disease of disparities, it is unlikely that projected disease reductions will be realized with current strategies. Programs to characterize current US HPV vaccine implementation and effectiveness are needed and continuing efforts to better understand HPV biology and to develop broadly protective prevention strategies and therapeutics for existing infections remain critical. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To establish the University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center that incorporates research approaches to address these gaps in knowledge. 2) To fund and support 4 projects representing a spectrum of interdisciplinary approaches including: A) modeling of PV-host interactions in 3 dimensions to define elements of epithelial cell biology and immunity that contribute to the pathogenesis and prevention of infections; B) utilizing novel vaccine strategies based on virus-display technology to generate broad protection against a majority of HPV infections; C) utilizing a unique bioinformatics system that captures all events of a US population-based cervical screening program to characterize implementation and effectiveness of primary and secondary HPV interventions; and D) developing a set of web-based tools to promote the informed adoption of HPV and other STI prevention. 3) To establish 2 cores housing shared resources to support these interdisciplinary research approaches: A) a biostatistics and bioinformatics core and B) a virus infection core supporting technologies for virus production, quantitation, and animal imaging and housing a biospecimen resource.       PROJECT 1:  GENITAL PAPILLOMAVIRUS INFECTIONS IN EPITHELIAL TISSUES (OZBUN, M.)      PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Over 100 types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) infect mucosal and cutaneous epithelium, causing benign and malignant tumors. About 6.2 million new cases of HPV sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are reported every year; >20 million people in the US are currently infected, and HPV is considered as the most common known STI worldwide. Overall, data suggest that a single sexual act can promote infection, indicating that the viruses are quite effective transmissible agents in vivo. Recently, we have been able to produce high-titer HPV stocks in the laboratory. Our studies using infectious HPV virions in cell culture studies and our colleagues' work with animal PVs indicate the viruses in general are poor at causing infections in vitro. We therefore postulate that the current monolayer cell culture PV infection model systems fail to accurately recapitulate the infectious process in vivo. Indeed, the major deficiencies in the study of genital HPV-related infections have included the lack of high titer infectious viral stocks and the lack of appropriate tissue-based model systems with which to study early infections, pathogenesis, and interventions. Our CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is that monolayer cell cultures fail to display essential aspects of epithelial tissue HPV infections and important features of HPV infection establishment can be determined from 3-dimensional (3-D) tissue-based models. We will use high titer HPV virion stocks to pursue this program's goals, which are to establish more physiologically relevant 3-D tissue models of HPV genital infections and to answer basic and essential questions about the initiation of productive HPV infections. To address our central hypothesis, we will pursue SPECIFIC AIMS that encompass three biologically integrated, and increasingly complex systems with regard to sexually transmitted PV infections. In Aim 1 we will define requirements for HPV infection of cells in differentiated epithelium in vitro. In Aim 2 we will use a rodent genital infection model to identify the cell types that are susceptible to HPV infection and to further determine how wounding potentiates infection in vivo. In Aim 3 we will evaluate genital PV infection establishment in the context of our non-human model of STI HPV infections wherein primate anatomy and immune response can be assessed. Hypotheses regarding specific aspects of genital PV binding and infection are posed so that whether supported or refuted, we will increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HPV-target cell interactions and the biology of epithelial tissue infection, areas vastly understudied. We expect this work will directly impact future development of broadly cross-protective prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for preventing persistent HPV STIs.           The University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary STI Prevention Center will focus on the most common sexually transmitted agents, human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. To maximally realize improvements in HPV prevention, the Center will partner basic biological discovery, technological advancements, populationbased effectiveness and diffusion of interventions across laboratory, clinical & real-world settings.",University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center,7736498,U19AI084081,[''],NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,U19,2009,2585878,0.15123059766701905
"""Patient Navigation in the SafetyNet: CONNECTeDD""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Despite advances in early detection and treatment options, racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status women continue to suffer advanced stage at diagnosis and higher mortality for both breast and cervical cancer. Delays in diagnosis and treatment, which contribute to poorer outcomes, have been associated with well known barriers to care. These disparities persist despite this knowledge represents a gap between discovery and delivery of cancer care resulting in a pressing need for effective interventions.   The objective of this study is to design, implement and evaluate a patient navigator intervention at six community health centers in Boston, Massachusetts. These sites represents a wide range of racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status women served by an urban safety net institution that mirrors the infrastructure of this country's urban health systems. The intervention is a model based on Andersen's Model of Health Services Use. Aided by an Electronic Medical Record tracking system and theory based cultural competency training, patient navigators will: identify cases, provide service coordination and direct patient support.   Our specific aims are to determine if the intervention will:   1. Reduce time to diagnosis (or resolution of abnormality) after an abnormal mammogram or Pap smear; 2. Reduce time to complete treatment and provide higher quality treatment after a cancer diagnosis; 3. Improve patient satisfaction with health care services; 4. Have critical components (time with patient vs. time coordinating care) which drive its success; 5.

"Participatory Research to Understand the Translation of HPV Vaccine Policy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In June of 2006, the FDA approved Merck's vaccine ""Guardasil"" which protects against 4 types of HPV infections, two which cause abnormal cervical dysplagia and two which cause genital warts. In the 15 months since the approval and the subsequent recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) that the vaccine be routinely administered to 11-12 year old girls, legislators in 41 states and the District of Columbia have introduced legislation to require, fund, or educate the public about the HPV vaccine, and at least 17 states have enacted some sort of legislation, including the state of New Mexico. In this application we propose to study the process of implementing policy regarding the HPV vaccine in the state of New Mexico, and related programmatic efforts to offer the vaccine and relevant education to parents and the public. This study is responsive to the call for proposals to conduct research on three areas of action: public policy, health care, and disease prevention. The Specific Aims are as follows: 1. Using a participatory process, identify and convene a stakeholder group composed of individuals involved in the health policy context 2. Explore the translation and impact of health policy initiatives regarding the dissemination of HPV vaccine and the promotion of informed decision making in New Mexico public schools and primary care settings. a. Conduct semi structured interviews with health policy makers, primary care providers, school based health providers and school administrators, in order to determine their perceptions of the roles b. Conduct focus group discussions with parents of 5th grade children c. Conduct ethnographic observations of the ongoing debate about the HPV vaccine dissemination policy 3. Together with the stakeholder group, interpret the data, develop and disseminate health policy recommendations regarding initiatives to support HPV vaccine dissemination and informed decision making leading to the reduction of cervical cancer health disparities in New Mexico. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The recent approval of the HPV vaccine is an important scientific advance but faces challenges in dissemination and implementation. This study will help to develop a better understanding of the factors that contribute to the development of HPV vaccine policy. These findings will be used to work toward the creation of strategies, both at the primary care and health policy level, to promote informed decision among patients with regard to the HPV vaccine that are consistent with community values.          ",Participatory Research to Understand the Translation of HPV Vaccine Policy,7690200,R21CA134259,"['Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Institution ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Better Breast and Cervical Cancer Control for Korean American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite considerable progress made in U.S. cancer control during the past 20 years, certain ethnic minority groups continue to experience significant health disparities. Breast and cervical cancer screening rates for Korean American (KA) women are far below the national goal, and below rates reported for other ethnic groups. As a result, KA women are often diagnosed at a later stage of cancer which can lead to a poor prognosis, high mortality, and subsequent emotional and financial burdens. Limited health literacy is emerging as a far-reaching, major barrier to cancer prevention behaviors, particularly among non-English speaking immigrant populations. This research application is formulated to answer research questions that address critical knowledge gaps in cancer control intervention research for linguistically and/or socially isolated ethnic minority communities using the KA community as an example. These questions are: (1) whether a health literacy-focused intervention using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) process will be effective in promoting health literacy and increasing breast and cervical cancer screening rates among KA women; and (2) whether a tailored intervention delivered by community health workers (CHWs) will be effective in such a community. The proposed study is a community-based, cluster-randomized clinical trial with two parallel arms, with a delayed intervention. A longitudinal repeated measures design will allow us to determine the effectiveness of the proposed health literacy-focused tailored cancer control intervention delivered by CHWs. A total of 480 KA women will participate in the study. The primary outcome of this study will be adherence to breast and cervical cancer screening. We hypothesize that, as compared to KA women in the control (delayed intervention) group, KA women who receive our literacy-focused tailored CHW intervention will demonstrate higher levels of adherence to screening for breast and cervical cancer. Through implementation of these research activities, we expect to establish a mechanism for disseminating critical health information for this population and to enhance a community network which will facilitate community access to breast and cervical cancer screening. While the focus of this research project is health literacy promotion and breast and cervical cancer screening among KA women, the core principles and methodology of this intervention can provide insights toward development of effective, culturally sensitive health literacy programs to meet the needs of socially and/or linguistically isolated minority groups with inadequate cancer control throughout the United States. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE: Korean American (KA) women have the second highest incidence of cervical cancer nationally and are experiencing rapid increases in breast cancer incidence. Limited capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions (i.e., limited health literacy) is a major barrier to early detection of cancer among KA women. This study proposes to test if a health literacy-focused intervention using a community- based participatory research process will be effective in promoting health literacy and increasing breast and cervical cancer screening rates among KA women; and (2) whether a tailored intervention delivered by trained community health workers will be effective in such a community.              Korean American (KA) women have the second highest incidence of cervical cancer nationally and are experiencing rapid increases in breast cancer incidence.

"HPV vaccine practices among Physicians Serving High Risk, Minority Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the United States, cervical cancer rates have declined in recent years, however ethnic and minority groups remain disproportionately affected. In Brooklyn, New York, an area with large immigrant populations and ethnically diverse communities, cervical cancer rates are significantly higher than national rates with some communities doubling the national incidence rate. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), and it is estimated that 6.2 million persons are newly infected every year. Although most infections with HPV are asymptomatic and self-limited, persistent infection with genital HPV infection can cause cervical cancer. Approximately 100 HPV serotypes have been identified; however there are two high-risk serotypes, HPV-16 and HPV-18 that cause approximately 70% of all cervical cancers. A quadrivalent HPV vaccine was licensed for use in the United States for females aged 9-26 years for prevention of HPV infection (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) and related cervical cancer in 2006. To date, most studies have focused on patient and parental barriers to vaccine acceptance. This study is unique in that it focuses on another key stakeholder in the HPV vaccine initiative- the physician and specifically those serving high risk populations. Physicians are often the primary and first source of information for parents and patients regarding vaccine awareness and knowledge. As such, the aims of this study are 1) To assess the self-reported rates of physician utilization of the HPV vaccine among their minority, high risk patient population, 2) To assess physicians' knowledge of, attitudes towards, beliefs regarding, and barriers to recommending the HPV vaccine, 3) To understand physician behaviors that affect the utilization of the HPV vaccine among high risk minority populations and 4) To propose a set of possible strategies to increase rates of HPV vaccination among high risk minority populations. The long term goal of the study is to improve utilization of the HPV vaccine, reducing HPV infection and cervical cancer among high risk, minority populations. A cross-sectional study will be utilized, and will include a random sample of pediatricians, adolescent medicine physicians and family practitioners that serve Brooklyn areas with high rates of cervical cancer. Five constructs will be addressed in a mailed, self administered survey: Knowledge about HPV, HPV vaccine and cervical cancer, Attitudes and beliefs towards the HPV vaccine, Physician barriers toward the HPV vaccine, Perceived patient barriers for the HPV vaccine and Evaluation of the perceived best modalities that could effect change in current HPV vaccine and cervical cancer prevention practices among their high risk patient population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of those affected by cervical cancer in the United States are from minority populations or foreign-born. Infection with the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is the most important risk factor for cervical cancer. In 2006, a vaccine to protect women against HPV was licensed and recommended for use in women as young as 9 years old. This study seeks to identify the issues that affect providers' utilization of the HPV vaccine with their high risk patients in order to develop strategies to assure that the populations most at risk for cervical cancer are given an opportunity to receive this important vaccine.              Project Narrative The majority of those affected by cervical cancer in the United States are from minority populations or foreign-born.

"Decision-Making about Childhood HPV Vaccination among Low SES Mothers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) and the necessary cause of cervical cancer, which disproportionately affects women of low socioeconomic status (SES). Introduction of the new HPV vaccine, currently available to females 9 to 26 years of age, therefore presents an unprecedented opportunity to eliminate disparities in cervical cancer morbidity and mortality through the primary prevention of the disease. Given the necessity of parental consent for the vaccination of minors, as well as the enhanced efficacy of the vaccine when delivered prior to the onset of the sexual activity, the present study explores decision-making regarding childhood HPV vaccination among low SES mothers of girl 9 to 17 years of age. A popular model of decision-making ' the Decision Support Framework (DSF) ' is used to guide both survey and brief, semi-structured interview questions aimed at determining the factors most predictive of mothers' expressed intentions towards HPV vaccination of their daughters and daughter's actual vaccination status at 8-month follow-up. Particular attention will be paid to modifiable barriers to HPV vaccination and will be used to guide future work to assist low SES mothers in making informed choices for their daughter regarding the vaccine. The ability of the new human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to eliminate socioeconomic disparities in cervical cancer will depend, in large part, on acceptability and uptake of the vaccine among low socioeconomic status (SES) mothers on behalf of their daughters, who are among those most at risk for the development of cervical cancer in the future. Given this, the present study explores decision-making about childhood HPV vaccination among low SES mothers of daughter 9 to 17 years of age (i.e., those who are eligible for the vaccine, but unable to provide their own consent for use). We use the Decision Support Framework (DSF) to guide baseline survey questions aimed at predicting mothers' vaccine intentions. Mothers will be recruited from an urban pediatric care clinic serving low income, primarily racial and ethnic minority patients. Eight months after their initial baseline assessment, clinic records will be used to determine daughter's HPV vaccination status, ranging from those who have completed the full series of three doses within 6 months to those who have not started the vaccine. Brief, semi-structured follow-up interviews will be conducted with a subset of mothers in each of the three child vaccination status groups. Questions will also be guided by the DSF and used to address the specific issues, concerns, and barriers that emerged for mothers in reference to pursuing the HPV vaccine for their daughter, including those who were successful completers of the vaccine series. Results from this research will be used to inform decision-making interventions for mothers from low SES backgrounds, many of whom may face unique barriers to vaccinating their daughters against HPV.             ",Decision-Making about Childhood HPV Vaccination among Low SES Mothers,7687472,R03CA130747,"['Daughter ', ' Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Caring ', ' Age-Years ', ' Consent ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Guidelines ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Series ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Interview ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minor ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Baseline Surveys ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Appointment ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Knowledge ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Trees ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Attention ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' Parental Consent ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' vaccine efficacy ', ' aged ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' ']",NCI,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R03,2009,75374,0.1892416019636083
"Promoting cancer screening for mothers using a daughter-initiated approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dr. Mosavel's career goal is to establish herself as an independent investigator in cancer control and behavioral research with a focus on African-Americans in low-income neighborhoods. The goal of this application is to integrate a strong mentoring, training, and focused research agenda to enable her to: 1) become an independent health disparities researcher who conducts large scale, community-based behavioral cancer interventions and 2) develop and strengthen her mixed methods skill set to effectively evaluate cancer interventions. The research plan examines the feasibility of the mother and adolescent daughter dyad, particularly from low-income, African-American households, as a unique portal within which to communicate critical cancer prevention and control information. The prevailing health promotion paradigm is that parents give their children advice about health. Consequently, there has been minimal focus on the influence that adolescents can have on their parents' health behaviors. The present study will focus on assessing the daughters' ability to influence their mothers' cancer screening behaviors. There are three specific aims. The first aim is to explore and identify the necessary conditions for effective giving and receiving of breast and cervical cancer information within the mother-daughter dyad. The second aim is to   design the delivery and evaluate the comprehension, credibility and emotional response associated with the daughter-initiated cancer message. Finally, the third aim is to conduct a study of a daughter-focused intervention to examine its effect on mothers' breast and cervical cancer screening behaviors. This study has the potential to utilize the assets of the mother-daughter dyad and promote cancer dialogue in the family. Consequently, a daughter-initiated intervention may have a significant impact on mothers' health behavior. Mothers who receive guided support and encouragement from their daughters may be more responsive to cancer screening messages and more likely to obtain a Pap smear and mammogram when compared to mothers who do not. Likewise, adolescent daughters who are provided with opportunities to discuss cancer prevention may, in turn, grow more knowledgeable and intent on eventually obtaining a Pap smear and mammogram. The proposed research will highlight the conditions that will lead to effective mother-daughter communication about breast and cervical cancer and an understanding of the processes related to this information sharing.

"HPV vaccine practices among Physicians Serving High Risk, Minority Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the United States, cervical cancer rates have declined in recent years, however ethnic and minority groups remain disproportionately affected. In Brooklyn, New York, an area with large immigrant populations and ethnically diverse communities, cervical cancer rates are significantly higher than national rates with some communities doubling the national incidence rate. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), and it is estimated that 6.2 million persons are newly infected every year. Although most infections with HPV are asymptomatic and self-limited, persistent infection with genital HPV infection can cause cervical cancer. Approximately 100 HPV serotypes have been identified; however there are two high-risk serotypes, HPV-16 and HPV-18 that cause approximately 70% of all cervical cancers. A quadrivalent HPV vaccine was licensed for use in the United States for females aged 9-26 years for prevention of HPV infection (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) and related cervical cancer in 2006. To date, most studies have focused on patient and parental barriers to vaccine acceptance. This study is unique in that it focuses on another key stakeholder in the HPV vaccine initiative- the physician and specifically those serving high risk populations. Physicians are often the primary and first source of information for parents and patients regarding vaccine awareness and knowledge. As such, the aims of this study are 1) To assess the self-reported rates of physician utilization of the HPV vaccine among their minority, high risk patient population, 2) To assess physicians' knowledge of, attitudes towards, beliefs regarding, and barriers to recommending the HPV vaccine, 3) To understand physician behaviors that affect the utilization of the HPV vaccine among high risk minority populations and 4) To propose a set of possible strategies to increase rates of HPV vaccination among high risk minority populations. The long term goal of the study is to improve utilization of the HPV vaccine, reducing HPV infection and cervical cancer among high risk, minority populations. A cross-sectional study will be utilized, and will include a random sample of pediatricians, adolescent medicine physicians and family practitioners that serve Brooklyn areas with high rates of cervical cancer. Five constructs will be addressed in a mailed, self administered survey: Knowledge about HPV, HPV vaccine and cervical cancer, Attitudes and beliefs towards the HPV vaccine, Physician barriers toward the HPV vaccine, Perceived patient barriers for the HPV vaccine and Evaluation of the perceived best modalities that could effect change in current HPV vaccine and cervical cancer prevention practices among their high risk patient population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of those affected by cervical cancer in the United States are from minority populations or foreign-born. Infection with the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is the most important risk factor for cervical cancer. In 2006, a vaccine to protect women against HPV was licensed and recommended for use in women as young as 9 years old. This study seeks to identify the issues that affect providers' utilization of the HPV vaccine with their high risk patients in order to develop strategies to assure that the populations most at risk for cervical cancer are given an opportunity to receive this important vaccine.              Project Narrative The majority of those affected by cervical cancer in the United States are from minority populations or foreign-born.

"Patn?? en Aksyon: Addressing Cervical Cancer Disparities in Little Haiti    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patnh en Aksyon (Partners in Action) is a well-established campus community partnership between the University of Miami and key Haitian community-based organizations in South Florida. Over the past four and a half years, Partnership members have been actively engaged in a Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) initiative to address the disproportionate burden of cervical cancer in Little Haiti, the predominately Haitian neighborhood in Miami. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in Little Haiti are significantly higher than elsewhere in the Miami metropolitan area, including other, low income, minority neighborhoods. As part of our effort to attenuate this disparity, we have learned about twalet deba, a feminine hygiene practice designed to cleanse, dry, and tighten the vagina for disease prevention and enhanced sexual pleasure of male partners. We believe, though have not yet empirically verified, that this practice may actually increase susceptibility to Human Papillomavirus (HPV), the principal cause of cervical cancer. The proposed research aims to fill this gap in understanding. We have planned a two-year exploratory study that integrates mixed methodologies. Indigenous Community Health Workers, or Ajan Fanm, will collect all study data. Integrating the Ajan Fanm into our study design is consistent with the tenets of CBPR and essential for achieving study aims, given their intimate knowledge of cultural norms related to the discussion of health and other sensitive topics. In the first phase of research, the Ajan Fanm will employ participant observation and in-depth interviewing techniques to better understand the socio-cultural significance of twalet deba, and how this practice is intricately tied to male-female relationships, lay perceptions of health and illness causation, and sexuality. Information learned from these data will inform the second phase of the proposed research. In this phase of inquiry, the Ajan Fanm will interview 250 Haitian women, and teach them to use a simple self- sampling device to collect a cervical specimen for HPV testing and cytology. This device has similar efficacy to the Pap smear, but it can be self-administered in the privacy of one's home, circumventing socio-cultural concerns about modesty prevalent among Haitian women. The cervical specimens will be evaluated by a certified pathologist for cytologic changes and tested for HPV using the Hologic/Third Wave Invader assay. In this exploratory study, our primary objective is to improve understanding about twalet deba and its potential association with HPV to inform future research and intervention that may attenuate the excess risk of cervical cancer in Little Haiti and other medically underserved, ethnic enclaves.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patne en Akyson (Partners in Action) is a well-established campus-community partnership between the University of Miami and key Haitian community-based organizations in South Florida.

"Better Breast and Cervical Cancer Control for Korean American Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite considerable progress made in U.S. cancer control during the past 20 years, certain ethnic minority groups continue to experience significant health disparities. Breast and cervical cancer screening rates for Korean American (KA) women are far below the national goal, and below rates reported for other ethnic groups. As a result, KA women are often diagnosed at a later stage of cancer which can lead to a poor prognosis, high mortality, and subsequent emotional and financial burdens. Limited health literacy is emerging as a far-reaching, major barrier to cancer prevention behaviors, particularly among non-English speaking immigrant populations. This research application is formulated to answer research questions that address critical knowledge gaps in cancer control intervention research for linguistically and/or socially isolated ethnic minority communities using the KA community as an example. These questions are: (1) whether a health literacy-focused intervention using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) process will be effective in promoting health literacy and increasing breast and cervical cancer screening rates among KA women; and (2) whether a tailored intervention delivered by community health workers (CHWs) will be effective in such a community. The proposed study is a community-based, cluster-randomized clinical trial with two parallel arms, with a delayed intervention. A longitudinal repeated measures design will allow us to determine the effectiveness of the proposed health literacy-focused tailored cancer control intervention delivered by CHWs. A total of 480 KA women will participate in the study. The primary outcome of this study will be adherence to breast and cervical cancer screening. We hypothesize that, as compared to KA women in the control (delayed intervention) group, KA women who receive our literacy-focused tailored CHW intervention will demonstrate higher levels of adherence to screening for breast and cervical cancer. Through implementation of these research activities, we expect to establish a mechanism for disseminating critical health information for this population and to enhance a community network which will facilitate community access to breast and cervical cancer screening. While the focus of this research project is health literacy promotion and breast and cervical cancer screening among KA women, the core principles and methodology of this intervention can provide insights toward development of effective, culturally sensitive health literacy programs to meet the needs of socially and/or linguistically isolated minority groups with inadequate cancer control throughout the United States. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE: Korean American (KA) women have the second highest incidence of cervical cancer nationally and are experiencing rapid increases in breast cancer incidence. Limited capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions (i.e., limited health literacy) is a major barrier to early detection of cancer among KA women. This study proposes to test if a health literacy-focused intervention using a community- based participatory research process will be effective in promoting health literacy and increasing breast and cervical cancer screening rates among KA women; and (2) whether a tailored intervention delivered by trained community health workers will be effective in such a community.

"South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION: South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities. The objective of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities (SUCCESS) is to establish a regional center addressing the unequal burden of cervical cancer in Miami Dade-County. SUCCESS will build on Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) relationships which we have established with Haitians in the city of Miami and Hispanics in the city of Hialeah. We will also partner with a 3rd multi ethnic less urban community located in the southern unincorporated Miami-Dade. Recognizing this as a very medically underserved area, our community partners selected this as our 3rd site. Our multiple PI leadership  team includes two investigators from the University of Miami's (UM) Departments of Medicine and   Epidemiology, both members of the UM Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. The third PI directs a large network of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). In partnership with three local FQHCs,  SUCCESS will to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment. Building on these findings and existing community partnerships we will conduct cancer outreach tailored to the unique needs of each community. Our major research project is a randomized study among 600 women in our three communities who have not been adequately screened for cervical cancer. At each site, one third of the women would be exposed to standard NCI approved outreach interventions and a second group will receive a comprehensive home based CHW intervention encouraging women to have Pap Smear testing at one of the three FQHCs. While CHWs are a promising approach, many women exposed to this intervention remain unscreened. Thus we propose a third approach in which women at each site receive the CHW intervention but also have the option of screening through HPV testing done via home based self-sampling. Our experience in Little Haiti is that by coupling this innovative molecular technology with a CHW led culturally tailored approach nearly all women agree to be screened. The SUCCESS pilot project will be led by one of our minority junior faculty. Through a pre-post test design, she will examine the impact of a CHW led educational curriculum that has been specifically tailored women who are HIV positive. Lastly, our training core will develop formal seminars in health disparities research and CBPR for twelve clinical fellows and post-doctoral trainees and provide a more intensive longitudinal practicum and mentorship on community-based participatory research to four early stage investigators including a preparing a CBPR grant proposal.          The vision of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities.(SUCCESS) is that through increased cervical cancer screening we could eliminate cervical cancer health disparities in our local community.

"Physicians' Intentions to Administer HPV Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer, genital warts, and other health conditions associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) exact substantial morbidity, mortality, and expenses. In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a quadrivalent HPV vaccine for females ages 9-26, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine vaccination for girls ages 11-12. Modest vaccination rates to date, however, indicate problems with increasing coverage and adherence to the recommended vaccine schedule, and may presage difficulties in realizing the vaccine's public health promise. Provider-oriented issues and challenges related to vaccine implementation may have been underestimated and remain insufficiently studied, especially with regard to primary care physicians (PCPs), who are well suited to provide vaccine to most young females. The broad objective of this study is to identify the appropriate constellation of factors that differentially relate to clinicians' stated intentions to administer HPV vaccine as recommended. Our central hypothesis is that clinicians' attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptions of issues as barriers significantly influence their intentions to administer the vaccine and, ultimately, their behavior, as predicted by the theory of planned behavior (TPB). We propose four specific aims: 1) to develop a theoretically-informed survey questionnaire for the assessment of TPB-based and other measures of PCPs' intentions to administer the HPV vaccine; 2) to implement the survey questionnaire among PCPs in Alabama and Mississippi; 3) to examine PCP characteristics and TPB-based measures regarding intention to administer HPV vaccine under different conditions; and 4) to identify groups of PCPs who can be differentiated with respect to the patterns of functional relations between the TPB-factors and intentionality. Using nominal group technique meetings and other steps, the survey instrument will be developed, pre-tested and piloted with PCPs and family practice residents and faculty. At least 300 complete survey responses will be collected from PCPs to allow examination of our hypotheses and relationships between relevant variables and intentionality under different patient conditions. Intentionality will be operationalized through a series of behaviorally anchored case vignettes. PCPs' awareness and attitudes regarding ACIP recommendations will also be evaluated. The study will be administered in two states with high HPV-associated disease burdens, acute PCP shortages, and low HPV immunization rates. The proposed research will yield important information to improve understanding of theoretical predictors and provider-based barriers to HPV vaccination in actual practice. This should also suggest useful direction for developing provider-based strategies to increase the likelihood of vaccine administration that could be studied in future research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HPV vaccination offers an effective prevention strategy for reducing the substantial morbidity and healthcare costs caused by persistent HPV infection, so long as problems besetting current modest vaccination rates are better understood and overcome. The proposed study will examine factors that differentially relate to clinicians' stated intentions to administer HPV vaccine, using new measures of intentionality and clinicians' evaluative perceptions of professional recommendations. Our work will help inform future research and the design of strategies to improve the likelihood that physicians would adopt recommendations for administering HPV vaccine.              Project narrative HPV vaccination offers an effective prevention strategy for reducing the substantial morbidity and healthcare costs caused by persistent HPV infection, so long as problems besetting current modest vaccination rates are better understood and overcome.

"A Multicultural, Multilingual HPV Vaccine Education DVD for Diverse Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a multicultural, multilingual DVD designed to promote health literacy about the HPV vaccine and foster informed HPV immunization decisions among parents of girls and girls ages 9-17 at high risk for HPV infection: Koreans, Vietnamese, Filipinos, African Americans, Latinos and low-income whites. This study will focus on one of those target populations: Latinos. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) identify HPV vaccine literacy levels, attitudes, perceptions and information sources among parents of girls 9-17 old, (2) identify cultural values, beliefs, and practices that influence attention, comprehension, perception and evaluation of HPV vaccine information intended to inform an immunization decision, (3) identify specific themes, message elements and communication strategies for a patient-centered intervention that enhances comprehension of the risks and benefits of the vaccine and its health implications to adequately inform an immunization decision, (4) assess the accessibility of DVD technology and its acceptability as the medium for an HPV vaccine education intervention to parents of preadolescent girls and adolescent girls and (5) develop a prototype DVD to asses the feasibility using this medium to deliver comprehensible, culturally competent, health literacy information on HPV immunization. The HHS Initiative to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities calls attention to the gaps in access to preventive health resources, principally among racial and ethnic minorities. This study to assess the feasibility of developing a multicultural, multilingual HPV education intervention through DVD technology responds to the National Cancer Institute's program on Interactive Media Technologies in Cancer Prevention, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control to promote the use of innovative media technology and/or communication approaches in cancer prevention and control applications used in medical and community settings. The study employs focus groups and cognitive interviews to identify cognitive and affective factors that impede or promote an informed HPV immunization decision. It will accrue 64 Latina parents of preadolescent girls and 64 Latina adolescent girls ages 13-17 from urban and rural settings to participate in 12 focus groups and 32 individual interviews; half of the focus groups and interviews will be conducted in Spanish. Focus group data collection will be augment through the use of a short questionnaire to obtain qualitative data regarding knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and prior behaviors related to HPV, cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This health literacy study addresses the need for multilingual, multicultural, HPV vaccine education materials to empower individuals at high risk for HPV infection to make an informed immunization decision, which offers a significant public health benefit.                 Project Narrative This health literacy study addresses the need for multilingual, multicultural, HPV vaccine education materials to empower individuals at high risk for HPV infection to make an informed immunization decision, which offers a significant public health benefit.","A Multicultural, Multilingual HPV Vaccine Education DVD for Diverse Populations",7944120,R43MD005198,"['Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Group Practice ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Infection ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' literacy ', ' Filipino ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' Licensing ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Marketing ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Parents ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Asses ', ' Equus asinus ', ' Donkey ', ' Printing ', ' tool ', ' Koreans ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Solutions ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Vaccines ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' trafficking ', ' cultural values ', ' technological innovation ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Devices ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' girls ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Affective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' commercial application ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Health Educators ', ' Provider ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Division of Cancer Prevention ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Cognitive ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Text ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Comprehension ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' HPV-High Risk ', ' High risk Human papilloma virus ', ' High risk Human Papillomavirus ', ' High risk HPV ', ' High Risk Oncogenic HPV ', ' ']",NIMHD,VALDEZ AND ASSOCIATES,R43,2010,61814,0.13829857008003948
"""Patient Navigation in the SafetyNet: CONNECTeDD""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Despite advances in early detection and treatment options, racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status women continue to suffer advanced stage at diagnosis and higher mortality for both breast and cervical cancer. Delays in diagnosis and treatment, which contribute to poorer outcomes, have been associated with well known barriers to care. These disparities persist despite this knowledge represents a gap between discovery and delivery of cancer care resulting in a pressing need for effective interventions.   The objective of this study is to design, implement and evaluate a patient navigator intervention at six community health centers in Boston, Massachusetts. These sites represents a wide range of racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status women served by an urban safety net institution that mirrors the infrastructure of this country's urban health systems. The intervention is a model based on Andersen's Model of Health Services Use. Aided by an Electronic Medical Record tracking system and theory based cultural competency training, patient navigators will: identify cases, provide service coordination and direct patient support.   Our specific aims are to determine if the intervention will:   1. Reduce time to diagnosis (or resolution of abnormality) after an abnormal mammogram or Pap smear; 2. Reduce time to complete treatment and provide higher quality treatment after a cancer diagnosis; 3. Improve patient satisfaction with health care services; 4. Have critical components (time with patient vs. time coordinating care) which drive its success; 5. Result in more cost-effective care.   We will use a quasi-experimental design with block randomization of six community health centers whose primary affiliation is with Boston Medical Center. Each site will be randomly assigned to either Breast or Cervical Patient Navigation. Thus, each of the Breast intervention sites will serve as a continuous comparison site for the Cervical intervention sites and vice versa.   We expect that the results of this study will inform the design of a generalizable standard, effective and cost efficient patient navigation model that will eliminate barriers to timely, quality cancer care among racial/ethnic minority and lower income populations         ","""Patient Navigation in the SafetyNet: CONNECTeDD""",8143948,U01CA116892,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resolution ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Scientific Evaluation ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Hospitals ', ' Cervical ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Low Income Population ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Boston ', ' Breast ', ' expectation ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Modeling ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' tv watching ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' safety net ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' effective intervention ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2010,200000,0.045219341004168245

"Promoting cancer screening for mothers using a daughter-initiated approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dr. Mosavel's career goal is to establish herself as an independent investigator in cancer control and behavioral research with a focus on African-Americans in low-income neighborhoods. The goal of this application is to integrate a strong mentoring, training, and focused research agenda to enable her to: 1) become an independent health disparities researcher who conducts large scale, community-based behavioral cancer interventions and 2) develop and strengthen her mixed methods skill set to effectively evaluate cancer interventions. The research plan examines the feasibility of the mother and adolescent daughter dyad, particularly from low-income, African-American households, as a unique portal within which to communicate critical cancer prevention and control information. The prevailing health promotion paradigm is that parents give their children advice about health. Consequently, there has been minimal focus on the influence that adolescents can have on their parents' health behaviors. The present study will focus on assessing the daughters' ability to influence their mothers' cancer screening behaviors. There are three specific aims. The first aim is to explore and identify the necessary conditions for effective giving and receiving of breast and cervical cancer information within the mother-daughter dyad. The second aim is to   design the delivery and evaluate the comprehension, credibility and emotional response associated with the daughter-initiated cancer message. Finally, the third aim is to conduct a study of a daughter-focused intervention to examine its effect on mothers' breast and cervical cancer screening behaviors. This study has the potential to utilize the assets of the mother-daughter dyad and promote cancer dialogue in the family. Consequently, a daughter-initiated intervention may have a significant impact on mothers' health behavior. Mothers who receive guided support and encouragement from their daughters may be more responsive to cancer screening messages and more likely to obtain a Pap smear and mammogram when compared to mothers who do not. Likewise, adolescent daughters who are provided with opportunities to discuss cancer prevention may, in turn, grow more knowledgeable and intent on eventually obtaining a Pap smear and mammogram. The proposed research will highlight the conditions that will lead to effective mother-daughter communication about breast and cervical cancer and an understanding of the processes related to this information sharing. Finally, the findings from the proposed research will lead to subsequent R21 and R01 community-based cancer intervention research.             ",Promoting cancer screening for mothers using a daughter-initiated approach,7890624,K01CA132960,"['Daughter ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Comprehension ', ' Intention ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Household Heads ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Household ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' African ', ' Literature ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Motivation ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Parents ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Breast ', ' skills ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Emotional ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' parental influence ', ' parent influence ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NCI,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,K01,2010,134460,0.09332401619075449
"Determinants of Participation in an Anal Cancer Prevention Trial    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (05) Comparative effectiveness research (CER) and specific Challenge Topic, 05-CA-102* Comparative Effectiveness Research on Cancer Screening. The project, ""Determinants of participation in an anal cancer prevention trial"" is designed to provide information that will be critical to the performance of a pivotal randomized clinical trial of screening and treatment of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) to prevent anal cancer. Anal cancer is a growing problem in the United States. Increasing by approximately 2 percent per year among both men and women in the general population, it is particularly common among certain high-risk groups such as HIV-positive men and women. Among HIV-positive individuals, the incidence of anal cancer has continued to increase despite the availability of effective anti-retroviral therapy (ART). The current incidence of anal cancer among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) may be as high as 137/100,000, or more than 10 times the current incidence of cervical cancer in the screened population of women in the U.S., and is higher than the highest incidence of cervical cancer in unscreened populations of women world-wide. The incidence of anal cancer is almost 7-fold higher among HIV-positive women compared with the general population. Like cervical cancer, anal cancer is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) and is preceded by a series of precancerous changes known as anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). The incidence of cervical cancer has been sharply reduced by screening with cervical cytology to identify women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which is then treated to prevent progression to cancer. Like cervical cancer anal cancer may be preventable through treatment of the anal equivalent, high-grade AIN (HGAIN). The combination of an unacceptably high incidence of anal cancer with the likelihood that anal cancer is preventable calls for urgent intervention. At this time however, there are no formal guidelines recommending anal screening and treatment of HGAIN. This is because no studies have yet been done to demonstrate that screening for and treatment of HGAIN reduced the incidence of anal cancer. The USPHS guidelines for the care of HIV-positive individuals currently state that ""anal cytology screening of HIV-seropositive MSM and of women may be useful preventive measures. However, studies of screening and treatment programs for AIN 2 or 3 need to be implemented before definitive recommendations for anal cytology screening can be made"". This application will provide critical information that will support the conduct of such a study, namely determinants of participation in a randomized clinical trial in which 50 percent of participants with HGAIN will be screened and treated, and 50 percent will be observed without treatment. At the end of a 5-year period, the number of anal cancer cases will be compared in both arms. Given the complexities of the underlying clinical issues that might govern willingness to participate, the increasing proportion of underrepresented minorities that comprise the HIV epidemic and the varying issues around participation that each of these racial/ethnic groups might have, a rigorous study to measure these determinants in geographically and racially/ethnically diverse groups that comprise the HIV epidemic in the U.S. is critical. The specific aims of this application are therefore to: 1. To identify and assess the determinants of provider willingness to refer eligible participants; 2. To identify and assess the determinants of patient willingness and motivation to participate in the RCT; and 3. To determine the optimum study design and sample size, and recruitment strategies based on the analysis of data from Aims 1 and 2. This application is responsive to this challenge topic in which data from earlier observational studies would be augmented with physician and patient acceptability data to permit the pivotal RCT to proceed. Although the results of the RCT will set standard of care for HIV-positive men and women, they will also have wide implications beyond that of the HIV-positive population. The results will guide screening and treatment for HIV-negative populations as well, and the study will provide a biobank of clinical specimens that will be invaluable to understanding molecular determinants of progression from anal intraepithelial neoplasia to anal cancer. These results will also be applicable to understanding the factors underlying progression to cervical cancer, and will be particularly important since assembly of such as biobank of women at risk for cervical cancer would be currently impossible given that the standard of care is to treat high-grade CIN to prevent cervical cancer. Finally, this study will have broad influence by informing strategies to enhance participation in clinical studies by underrepresented minority groups. 7. Project Narrative (for lay audience) The incidence of anal cancer among people with HIV is higher than cervical cancer was before routine cervical cytology screening was introduced, but unlike cervical cancer, there are currently no screening recommendations in place for anal cancer. The proposed focus group/survey study will be essential to planning a large definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) in HIV-positive men and women to test whether treatment of anal cancer precursors identified through anal cytology screening can prevent anal cancer. The RCT planned with the assistance of this proposed study will set the standard of care for HIV- positive men and women, but will also have wide implications for screening and treatment for HIV- negative populations, as well as understanding the factors underlying progression to cervical and anal cancer.                  7.

"University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center Over 6 million new cases of sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPVs) infections are reported every year making HPV the most common sexually transmitted agent world-wide. At least 15 carcinogenic HPV types cause virtually all cervical cancers however; the costly HPV vaccine licensed in 2006 covers only HPV types 6/11/16/18 and has no therapeutic effect on established infections. Thus all women must continue routine cervical screening at a US cost of $4-5 billion annually. More importantly, the majority of women alive today are still at risk for developing cervical cancer. In addition, the current vaccine program presently leaves all men unprotected. Given these considerations and the fact that cervical cancer is a disease of disparities, it is unlikely that projected disease reductions will be realized with current strategies. Programs to characterize current US HPV vaccine implementation and effectiveness are needed and continuing efforts to better understand HPV biology and to develop broadly protective prevention strategies and therapeutics for existing infections remain critical. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To establish the University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center that incorporates research approaches to address these gaps in knowledge. 2) To fund and support 4 projects representing a spectrum of interdisciplinary approaches including: A) modeling of PV-host interactions in 3 dimensions to define elements of epithelial cell biology and immunity that contribute to the pathogenesis and prevention of infections; B) utilizing novel vaccine strategies based on virus-display technology to generate broad protection against a majority of HPV infections; C) utilizing a unique bioinformatics system that captures all events of a US population-based cervical screening program to characterize implementation and effectiveness of primary and secondary HPV interventions; and D) developing a set of web-based tools to promote the informed adoption of HPV and other STI prevention. 3) To establish 2 cores housing shared resources to support these interdisciplinary research approaches: A) a biostatistics and bioinformatics core and B) a virus infection core supporting technologies for virus production, quantitation, and animal imaging and housing a biospecimen resource. The University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary STI Prevention Center will focus on the most common sexually transmitted agents, human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. To maximally realize improvements in HPV prevention, the Center will partner basic biological discovery, technological advancements, population-based effectiveness and diffusion of interventions across laboratory, clinical & real-world settings.",University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center,7929531,U19AI084081,[''],NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,U19,2010,2700586,0.22685487790519893
"A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among Pacific Islander Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among PI Women ABSTRACT  Despite the fact that cervical cancer is one of the most preventable of cancers, it remains one of the top five causes of cancer deaths in the U.S. and in California. The Pap test has been shown to be effective in not only detecting cancer but also precancerous cells. Even with the introduction of HPV testing and vaccines, Pap tests represent an important cervical cancer prevention and early detection method for women in this country. Unfortunately, the Pap test is severely underutilized among many ethnic and racial populations, including Pacific Islanders (PIs) who have high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality data among specific PI ethnic groups is sparse, with available information underscoring significant cancer health disparities. In California as in the Pacific, cervical cancer is one of the top five causes of cancer deaths. Given the dearth of PI researchers and studies at the NIH level, community-based participatory research (CBPR) holds the potential for engaging community cultural experts alongside cancer health disparities researchers to address their pressing cervical cancer detection needs.  This five year cluster unit randomized trial will develop and evaluate a social support intervention targeting both men and women to increase Pap testing decision making and behavior among Chamorro, Samoan and Tongan women age 18-65 years old in Southern California. We aim to: 1. Apply CBPR principles and processes for community/university partners throughout the grant period; 2. Develop and pretest two gender-specific and culturally tailored educational interventions for PI women and men. The interventions will be conducted separately by gender, and will employ a video, flipchart,  and brochure, along with small-group discussions facilitated by gender-matched community health  educators; 3. Develop and validate instruments measuring men's social support (provided), women's social support  (perceived) and women's decision making utility; 4. Recruit and randomly assign community-based organizational samples and recruit and follow the cohorts of PI females and males in the intervention and control groups 5. Examine the associations that test the conceptual model regarding social support, decision making  utility, and Pap testing intentions and behaviors; 6. Follow the cohort of PI women and men in the intervention vs. control groups to assess the impact of  the intervention. Using a longitudinal cohort design, we will identify, recruit, and randomly assign PI members of churches and other community-based organizations to one of two intervention options: a) a culturally tailored social support intervention group for women and men consisting of community health educator-facilitated video, flipchart and brochure; or b) a usual care control group, consisting of pre-existing cancer education materials (brochures) for PI women and men delivered by community health educators. We posit that the planned social support intervention will increase men's provision, and women's perceptions, of Pap testing social support, leading to increases in women's prioritization of Pap testing decision making utility and Pap testing behaviors.  The proposed study team involves long-standing university and community collaborators, and uses a multiple PI model to institutionalize shared participation and leadership structures. The community side of this CBPR study includes three CBOs with years of experience in health promotion, disease prevention, and collaborative research for their respective PI populations. The university side includes experienced behavioral scientists in CBPR, cancer control and decision making with multiethnic populations. This study will add to the existing science of cancer health disparities by adapting and applying well-established behavioral theories to understand the ways in which collectivist-oriented interventions influence individual women's cancer screening behavioral changes. Furthermore, this study will illuminate the CBPR engagement aspects necessary to conduct rigorous intervention research in small-size populations. The product of this study will be a culturally-tailored intervention that holds the potential to become a model for other collectivistic populations. Strengths of this study include: i) a focus on a major cancer health disparity; ii) development and testing of methods that are applicable to other health disparities; iii) a theoretical focus on decision making (a priority area for NCI regarding translational research); iv) an intervention approach that investigates and develops new strategies to improve cultural tailoring and evaluation; v) a focus on men; and vi) an ethnically diverse team of community and university investigators with an established track record in CBPR research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among Pacific Islander Women Project Narrative  Pacific Islanders (PIs) experience some of the highest cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in the U.S., yet little research exists on the ways to address and ameliorate their cancer health disparities.

"Reducing Cervical Cancer in Appalachia In response to RFA ES-02-009, a multi-disciplinary group of investigators from the Ohio State University and the University of Michigan have collaborated to propose a Center for Population Health and Health Disparities focusing on an important health issue in underserved populations,cancer. The Center will initially focus on the goal of understanding why high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are observed in Appalachia Ohio, a mainly rural area in Southern and Eastern Ohio. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research within the framework of the Social Determinants of Health model in three inter-related projects and four supporting cores. All studies will be conducted in 16 clinics which represent the general population of women aged 18 and older in the region. We will utilize the Center's internal and external advisory committees and community partners organized into a community advisory board and Consortium of communityorganizations to facilitate the accomplishment of project goals. Project 1 will recruit 1600 women to an observational study to  investigate multi-level (social, environmental, behavioral, and biological) correlates of ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization, in Phase I. From this cohort of women, those who smoke (30%) will be eligible to participate in Project 2, which tests the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote smoking cessation (behavioral) and validate cessation endpoints with saliva cotinine measurements (biological) in a quasi-experimental trial design; those women who are in need of & Pap test (48% of 1600) will be eligible to participate in Phase II of Project 1 which will test the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization (behavioral) and follow-up for abnormalities (biological) detected in a quasi-experimental trial design. Project 3 will examine the contribution of HPV (biological) to cervical abnormalities in Appalachia in relation to individual-level behaviors (e.g. smoking, sexual activity) within the social and environmental region of Appalachia in a case-control observational study among women who have Pap smears in these 16 clinics.The research will be supported by four cores: A) Administration - fiscal and Center oversight; B) Biostatistics and Data Resources - sample selection, data management, data analysis, and population data resources; C) Clinical Correlative Sciences - collect, obtain and process biomarker specimens; and D) Behavioral Assessment and Intervention - train interviewers and lay health educators, conduct interviews, design intervention material, and facilitate  communication amongst sites. The Center includes a mechanism for pilot project solicitation, review and funding. This Center has institutional commitment in terms of personnel, funds and space, as well as, a commitment to focus on the problem of health disparities in the region. Finally, members of the team have worked together in the past in various settings that focus on the goals of the proposed Center and have an established relationship in Appalachian Ohio for the purpose of improving the health of the population. Future work of this Center will focus on moving this type of multi-level observational and interventional community-based research, into other areas where health disparities exist in relation to cancer withinour region. Cervical cancer disparities exist among women in Appalachia. Our previous work has found that the prevalence of factors known to cause cervical cancer e.g. tobacco use, genetic predisposition, HPV infection, and stress due to economic conditions, are disproportionately higher in this population. This Center, CARE II, proposes to use a transdisciplinary research team in conjunction with community partners, to address and reduce this health disparity.",Reducing Cervical Cancer in Appalachia,7867004,P50CA105632,[''],NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,P50,2010,1931598,0.1361020981051039
"HPV Outcomes: Prevention Epidemiology and Surveillance (HOPES) New Mexico (NM) is the only state with the capacity to fully monitor cervical cancer screening and human  papillomavirus (HPV) prevention using a state-wide woman-based electronic informatics system under  mandated reporting. We are uniquely positioned to address gaps in understanding HPV vaccine impact and  effectiveness within a mulit-cultural US population suffering many disparities. Our project will accomplish  three integrated specific aims required to provide definitive baseline characterizations of the opportunistic  cervical cancer screening program in NM. In Aim 1, we will establish the individual HPV genotype distribution  of 37 HPV genotypes needed to appropriately monitor expected or unexpected population-based impact of  HPV vaccines. Although we have performed a state-wide sampling of over 60,000 cervical samples  targeting all women with abnormal Pap tests and a random sample of women with normal Pap tests, our  existing resources were limited to HPV genoytping of 40,000 samples. In this Aim we will achieve the  targeted sample size by performing the additional 20,000 HPV genotype assays.We will describe the agespecific  population-based genotype distribution and determine the genotype-specific risk for CIN2+  outcomes across the 2 year grant period. In Aim 2, we will convene a pathology panel to determine  consensus diagnoses for ~8,000 cervical biopsies including >CIN/AIS. The consensus diagnoses will be  compared to community-based diagnoses determined for the same specimens through use of the NM HPV  Pap Registry (NMHPVPR) data warehouse. We will create a gold standard slide set that will enable  standardization of future population-based assessments, a prerequisite for determining the real-world impact  and effectiveness of HPV vaccination. In Aim 3 we will develop a shared image resource of the cervical  biopsy tissues and validate the use of image-based versus glass-based diagnoses. Because the impact of  HPV vaccines is expected to increase over time, longitudinal periodic assessments will be expected to span  several decades. Image-based diagnostic standards will be critical to future population evaluations.   In the interest of the health of all women, our research program will conduct longitudinal population- based surveillance in New Mexico to assess the overall benefits and risks associated with HPV vaccines  and other cervical cancer prevention measures.  New Mexico offers a rich opportunity to conduct this  research in diverse multi-cultural populations that suffer many health disparities including those  attributable to high levels of poverty and rural living.  In the background of the already highly successful  US cervical cancer screening programs with an estimated cost of over $5 billion annually, investment in  this research program represents due diligence.

"REACH UP & OUT: Eliminating Breast and Cervical Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been well documented that disparities exist between African American and white women with regard to morbidity and mortality associated with breast and cervical cancer. We have established a very active coalition, conducted comprehensive needs assessments, and developed and pilot-tested a community action plan to reduce breast and cervical cancer screening disparities between white and African American women in Alabama's Black Belt. Although effective and well received by the community, this intervention did not lead to behavior change among all women within the targeted population. The overall purpose of the proposed intervention is to further reduce breast and cervical cancer disparities between white and African American women in the Black Belt of Alabama by increasing Pap smear and mammography rates. We propose to develop and implement a multi-component intervention that uses media, education, and enhanced access, incorporating sociological and cognitive behavioral approaches in the development and implementation of the messages. This intervention is an extension of our pilot work utilizing community health advisors (CHAs) (sociologic approach). Although the pilot intervention showed significant increase in breast and cervical cancer screening among African American women in the Black Belt, there is still a hard to-reach group, which, despite our efforts, has not engaged in breast and cervical cancer screening. Based on the results of follow-up interviews with this group of women and discussions with our coalition members and CHAs, we propose the development, implementation, and evaluation of an enhanced intervention, which incorporates cognitive behavioral approaches that will challenge the barriers (e.g., fear of finding out they have cancer, the belief that screening will not make any difference) and reinforce the motivators (e.g., support from other women) to engage this group in breast and cervical cancer screening. Although the Community-Based Participatory Research and the Empowerment Model will be the overall conceptual framework used in this study, the PEN-3 and the Health Belief Model will guide intervention development and implementation. The intervention counties will receive education and cognitive/behavioral skills training delivered by CHAs, while the control counties will continue to receive our current intervention that has proven to be successful. The study will be carried out in two phases. In Phase I, we will refine the enhanced intervention and assessment tools through formative assessment. In Phase II, we will randomly assign the counties to intervention/control groups, implement, and evaluate the intervention.          ",REACH UP & OUT: Eliminating Breast and Cervical Cancer Disparities,7758844,R24MD002747,"['Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' base ', ' Alabama ', ' Phase ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' tool ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Belief ', ' behavior change ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' skills training ', ' Breast ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' County ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Community Actions ', ' community intervention ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R24,2010,572913,0.1337166819008851
"Disparities in cervical cancer precursors and deregulation of imprinted genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although screening for uterine cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN) and its aggressive treatment has resulted in decreased cervical cancer incidence and mortality, an estimated 11,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) and 40,000 cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS) continue to be diagnosed every year in the United States. ICC incidence is 60% higher and mortality over two times higher in African Americans compared to whites. Such disparate rates in incidence and mortality are despite comparable screening rates to detect precursor lesions, comparable prevalence of 'high risk' human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the etiologic agent, and co-factors such as cigarette smoking. Reasons for such disparities are largely unknown. A more detailed understanding of the etiology of lesions that progress will improve risk stratification to distinguish women with a low risk of progression from those likely to rapidly progress to invasive cancer. We posit that deregulation of genomically imprinted genes, a group of approximately 50 known growth-regulatory genes where only one allele is normally active, may predict progression to cervical cancer. We found that a substantial group of imprinted genes exhibit altered expression in ICC versus normal cervical epithelium. In addition, methylation analysis of two regulatory regions controlling IGF2 expression shows deviation from normal in specimens with CIN2-CIN3 classification and more profound deviation in invasive cancers. Together, these findings suggest that imprinted genes are deregulated in ICC and these features may improve detection of CIN cases likely to progress. Our central hypothesis is that deregulation at imprint regulatory elements of imprinted genes, likely influenced by environmental exposures, increases risk of progression to cervical cancer in women infected with 'high risk' HPV. We have already shown racial variation on the effect of environmental exposures on imprint deregulation, and thus, further hypothesize that higher risk in African Americans and Hispanics is due to race/ethnic differences in deregulation of these genes. Our specific aims are to: (1) determine if deregulation of imprint regulatory elements of known imprinted genes is associated with increased risk of progression of CIN1 to CIN2+, and whether this association varies by race/ethnicity; (2) determine whether aberrant methylation of imprint regulatory elements in cervical cells is similar to that found in peripheral blood cells, suggesting an early event; and associated with (i) transcriptional expression, and (ii) loss of imprinting; (3) evaluate whether deregulation of known imprinted genes in cervical cells can be used to discriminate women with CIN2+ among 500 Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance (ASCUS) cases. To address the Aims, we will recruit and follow 1,500 women with CIN1 and 500 with ASCUS, and examine the association between aberrant methylation markers at imprinted regulatory elements of 12 genes and progression from CIN1 to CIN2+. We will then test the performance of these markers to identify CIN2+ cases from among 500 ASCUS cases. Data from the proposed study will improve triage decisions and reduce disparities in ICC morbidity and mortality.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although screening for cervical intraepithelial lesions to prevent cervical cancer has resulted in decreased cancer incidence and mortality, an estimated 11,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer and 40,000 carcinomas in situ cases continue to be diagnosed every year in the United States with incidence 60% higher and mortality >2-times higher in African Americans compared to whites. We will recruit and follow 1,500 CIN1 and 500 cases of Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance (ASCUS), and examine the association between aberrant methylation at imprinted regulatory elements of 12 genes and progression to CIN2 or worse and then test the performance of these markers in ASCUS cases, independent of known co-factors.

"Kin Keeper:Reducing Disparities Through Cancer Literacy and Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of the phenomena health disparities requires researchers and public health educators to use many strategies to devise ways of reducing disparities and implement programs with the goal of eliminating those disparities. We are proposing to focus on breast and cervical cancer screening among Black, Latina, and Arab women living in the United States. This will be done by investigating the effectiveness of the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention, a female-family focused educational intervention for medically underserved women applied in a real world setting, using a randomized control trial design. The Kin KeeperSM model uses synergy and natural communication that exists among female family members to increase cancer prevention education and screening, which translates into functional cancer literacy. Simultaneously we will be using a two-step approach that also includes measuring the cost of the intervention, which is in important if the model is going to be sustained and have public utility in decreasing and ultimately eliminating cancer disparities. The goals of this research project are: 1) To determine if the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention increases first time and appropriately timed breast cancer screening rates among Black, Latina, and Arab women; 2) To determine if the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention increases first time and appropriately timed cervical cancer screening rates among Black, Latina, and Arab women; 3) To measure functional cancer literacy over time at the individual and family level and; 4) To assess costs and rates of health care utilization among women in the Kin KeeperSM model and the comparison group. By combining a community based approach with our university-community partnership as well as health services research methodology, we anticipate that we will have sustainable model to impact breast and cervical cancer disparities among medically underserved women.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this research will impact public health agencies and research on planning and intervention design; as to more effectively promote breast and cervical cancer screening and early detection for medically underserved women.

"Reducing Health Disparities: Survey Validation for Black, Latina and Arab Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A critical undertaking in designing research interventions that study effective ways to reduce health disparities among racial/ethnic and underserved women is to have instruments that are linguistically and culturally appropriate and that have been validated for use in those specific populations. Health literacy is increasingly recognized as an important variable and related to breast and cervical cancer disparities. However, the current health literacy measurement tools are not sufficient to assess a woman's functional cancer literacy. In this developmental phase of our research, our goal is to determine the psychometric properties of two newly created measures of cancer literacy. The cancer literacy assessment tools (CLAT) will measure a woman's functional understanding of breast and cervical cancer. This research will produce two instruments for use in English, Spanish and Arabic women for measuring a women's functional understanding of breast and cervical cancer. The instruments will be validated with Black, Latina and Arab women, within the context of a female-family home-based educational intervention. Working with a recruitment model we have used successfully in prior research, we will recruit women who are connected with established public health programs who will serve as liaisons by recruiting other females in their families to take the cancer literacy assessments. Qualitative and quantitative analysis will be used to produce two instruments with good psychometric properties, including reliability, cross cultural measurement invariance, and predictive validity. Measurement invariance including identification of differential item functioning (DIF) will be established using multigroup structural equation modeling with means structures. Multilevel modeling will be used to take the hierarchical nature of the sampling into account. By having baseline cancer literacy measures, this research study will be increasing the capacity of the community of science and public health agencies to more effectively design interventions that promote screening and early detection among women who are at high risk for breast and cervical cancer mortality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this research will directly impact public health agencies and research on planning and intervention design; as to more effectively promote breast and cervical screening and early detection for medically underserved women. This will be done by providing a baseline measure for cancer literacy in three groups of women, Black, Latina and Arab, who are disproportionately affected by breast and cervical cancer mortality.

"South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION: South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities. The objective of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities (SUCCESS) is to establish a regional center addressing the unequal burden of cervical cancer in Miami Dade-County. SUCCESS will build on Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) relationships which we have established with Haitians in the city of Miami and Hispanics in the city of Hialeah. We will also partner with a 3rd multi ethnic less urban community located in the southern unincorporated Miami-Dade. Recognizing this as a very medically underserved area, our community partners selected this as our 3rd site. Our multiple PI leadership  team includes two investigators from the University of Miami's (UM) Departments of Medicine and   Epidemiology, both members of the UM Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. The third PI directs a large network of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). In partnership with three local FQHCs,  SUCCESS will to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment. Building on these findings and existing community partnerships we will conduct cancer outreach tailored to the unique needs of each community. Our major research project is a randomized study among 600 women in our three communities who have not been adequately screened for cervical cancer. At each site, one third of the women would be exposed to standard NCI approved outreach interventions and a second group will receive a comprehensive home based CHW intervention encouraging women to have Pap Smear testing at one of the three FQHCs. While CHWs are a promising approach, many women exposed to this intervention remain unscreened. Thus we propose a third approach in which women at each site receive the CHW intervention but also have the option of screening through HPV testing done via home based self-sampling. Our experience in Little Haiti is that by coupling this innovative molecular technology with a CHW led culturally tailored approach nearly all women agree to be screened. The SUCCESS pilot project will be led by one of our minority junior faculty. Through a pre-post test design, she will examine the impact of a CHW led educational curriculum that has been specifically tailored women who are HIV positive. Lastly, our training core will develop formal seminars in health disparities research and CBPR for twelve clinical fellows and post-doctoral trainees and provide a more intensive longitudinal practicum and mentorship on community-based participatory research to four early stage investigators including a preparing a CBPR grant proposal.          The vision of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities.(SUCCESS) is that through increased cervical cancer screening we could eliminate cervical cancer health disparities in our local community. To do so, SUCCESS will utilize the Community Based Participatory Research approach to reduce disparities through a combination of outreach, research and training.

"Understanding the Cervical Cancer Health Gap for Women in Jail    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women in the criminal justice system are four-five times as likely to have cervical cancer compared to non- incarcerated women. Some have attributed this disparity to difficulty in follow-up of abnormal Paps, but little is known empirically about why women involved in the criminal justice system have low abnormal Pap follow-up rates. The objective of this application is two-fold: to understand the interpretation of abnormal Pap events and their subsequent follow-up from the perspective of incarcerated women; second, to interpret women's abnormal Pap events and follow-ups based on a review of their medical records. The validation of women's accounts of abnormal Pap follow-up (or lack thereof) with medical chart review will provide an understanding as to why some women do not gain access to follow-up care. Thus, we will be able target interventions to address this documented gap in women's understanding of abnormal Pap events versus actual events. To meet this objective, first we will conduct focus groups and in-depth interviews with 40 women in a Kansas City county jail about abnormal Pap screening and subsequent follow-up events. Studying women's experiences with abnormal Paps and follow-up may provide clues as to their cervical cancer screening knowledge and the processes by which women actually seek out cervical cancer prevention services given their movement in and out of jails. Second, we will ask the 40 women previously interviewed for permission to access their medical records, in order to investigate whether incarcerated women's self-report of abnormal Pap and follow-up events matched actual medical records of these events. This aim will allow us to gauge women's understanding of Pap events, validate the medical barriers that women faced in trying to gain access to follow- up care, and demonstrate the feasibility of assessing health care access through medical chart review for this high-risk population. This project has significance for public health impact by providing insight into how to address the cervical cancer burden for women involved in the criminal justice system. This project is innovative in its goal of assessing incarcerated women's understanding of abnormal Pap events and validating their understanding with medical record review. Study findings will contribute to the development of an intervention that attempts to close the cervical cancer health gap between women involved in the criminal justice system and their sisters in the ""free"" world.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact of this study is that it will inform interventions that reduce cervical health morbidity and mortality for an already disadvantaged group, women involved in the criminal justice system. This study will tell us not only about the chasm between women's understanding of Pap events and actual medical encounters, but will also speak more generally to this population's experience with health care access, given their movement in and out of the criminal justice system.           The public health impact of this study is that it will inform interventions that reduce cervical health morbidity and mortality for an already disadvantaged group, women involved in the criminal justice system.

"HPV Vaccination in the Cambodian Community    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Virtually all cancers of the cervix are caused by HPV infection. Several HPV vaccines (that could prevent 70 percent of all cervical cancers) have been approved for American girls and young women. The majority of Cambodian Americans came to the US as immigrants and over one-half have limited English proficiency. Women of Southeast Asian descent have higher cervical cancer incidence rates than any other racial/ethnic group, and the incidence among Cambodians is twice the incidence among non-Hispanic whites (15.0 versus 7.7 per 100,000). The study goal is to conduct mixed-methods research that could be used to inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of culturally appropriate HPV vaccination interventions targeting Cambodian women with daughters in the 9-17 age group. Qualitative and quantitative methods should both be used to examine determinants of preventive health practices in Southeast Asian and other immigrant groups. Our primary objectives are: to provide qualitative data relevant to the promotion of HPV vaccine use in Cambodian communities; and quantitative data about the uptake of HPV vaccination among Cambodian adolescents, as well as correlates of HPV vaccine uptake. A recent review of HPV vaccine surveillance in the US found no publications addressing the reliability of self-reported HPV vaccine uptake. Our secondary objective is to assess the test-retest reliability of survey measures addressing HPV vaccine uptake in a Cambodian study group. Our community-based participatory research will build on a long-standing collaboration with the Cambodian community. An existing Cambodian Community Coalition will serve as the community advisory board for the project. Cambodian women who have a daughter in the 9-17 age group and live in the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area will be included in this study. Our research will use the theoretical perspective of the Health Behavior Framework. Qualitative and quantitative study phases will be conducted sequentially. We will complete 25 qualitative interviews with Cambodian mothers. Qualitative data findings will be used to guide the development of a quantitative survey instrument.

"Physicians' Intentions to Administer HPV Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer, genital warts, and other health conditions associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) exact substantial morbidity, mortality, and expenses. In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a quadrivalent HPV vaccine for females ages 9-26, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine vaccination for girls ages 11-12. Modest vaccination rates to date, however, indicate problems with increasing coverage and adherence to the recommended vaccine schedule, and may presage difficulties in realizing the vaccine's public health promise. Provider-oriented issues and challenges related to vaccine implementation may have been underestimated and remain insufficiently studied, especially with regard to primary care physicians (PCPs), who are well suited to provide vaccine to most young females. The broad objective of this study is to identify the appropriate constellation of factors that differentially relate to clinicians' stated intentions to administer HPV vaccine as recommended. Our central hypothesis is that clinicians' attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptions of issues as barriers significantly influence their intentions to administer the vaccine and, ultimately, their behavior, as predicted by the theory of planned behavior (TPB). We propose four specific aims: 1) to develop a theoretically-informed survey questionnaire for the assessment of TPB-based and other measures of PCPs' intentions to administer the HPV vaccine; 2) to implement the survey questionnaire among PCPs in Alabama and Mississippi; 3) to examine PCP characteristics and TPB-based measures regarding intention to administer HPV vaccine under different conditions; and 4) to identify groups of PCPs who can be differentiated with respect to the patterns of functional relations between the TPB-factors and intentionality. Using nominal group technique meetings and other steps, the survey instrument will be developed, pre-tested and piloted with PCPs and family practice residents and faculty. At least 300 complete survey responses will be collected from PCPs to allow examination of our hypotheses and relationships between relevant variables and intentionality under different patient conditions. Intentionality will be operationalized through a series of behaviorally anchored case vignettes. PCPs' awareness and attitudes regarding ACIP recommendations will also be evaluated. The study will be administered in two states with high HPV-associated disease burdens, acute PCP shortages, and low HPV immunization rates. The proposed research will yield important information to improve understanding of theoretical predictors and provider-based barriers to HPV vaccination in actual practice. This should also suggest useful direction for developing provider-based strategies to increase the likelihood of vaccine administration that could be studied in future research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HPV vaccination offers an effective prevention strategy for reducing the substantial morbidity and healthcare costs caused by persistent HPV infection, so long as problems besetting current modest vaccination rates are better understood and overcome. The proposed study will examine factors that differentially relate to clinicians' stated intentions to administer HPV vaccine, using new measures of intentionality and clinicians' evaluative perceptions of professional recommendations. Our work will help inform future research and the design of strategies to improve the likelihood that physicians would adopt recommendations for administering HPV vaccine.              Project narrative HPV vaccination offers an effective prevention strategy for reducing the substantial morbidity and healthcare costs caused by persistent HPV infection, so long as problems besetting current modest vaccination rates are better understood and overcome.

"Bilingual Web-Novelas to Reach Young Latinas with Cervical Cancer Information    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of cervical cancer among Latinas in the United States is twice the rate of non-Latina white women (1,2,3,4,5), and Latinas have the second highest mortality rate related to this preventable disease. (1) There are various factors that contribute to this health disparity, (1,2,3,4,5) but one of the main factors that contributes to this high incidence and mortality rate, and the one we would like to address with our innovation, is the lack of culturally and linguistically appropriate information regarding regular pap smears and HPV vaccines. ACMA Social Marketing, through its fotonovela production arm, The Fotonovela Production Company, aims to remedy the lack of information disparity related to Latina women ages 18-26, via1the1development1of1the1 web1novela,1an1innovation1 of the educational fotonovela adapted and applied to the internet and its related social media. The timing of the adaptation of a culturally familiar entertainment education tool, namely the fotonovela (11,12,13,14,15) into a web-based tool is appropriate given the growing evidence that more and more young Latinos are accessing the web and using social media to find and share information. (6,7,8) The specific aims of this application are to: 1) produce a bilingual (Spanish and English) prototype of the web-novela innovation on evidence-based (9) information on cervical cancer prevention and early detection; and 2), demonstrate knowledge, gain and assess acceptability and feasibility of the innovation among Spanish and English dominant Latina women ages 18-26 who use the Internet or Smart Phones. For the latter aim we will convene ten focus group interviews, administer a pre and post test to assess knowledge gain and conduct a follow up discussion to explore and assess the values, beliefs, barriers and motivators that affect Latina's1decisions1to1get1Pap1tests and HPV vaccines. In addition to focus group interviews with our primary audience, we will conduct individual interviews with health professionals and gatekeepers working in the cervical cancer field to gain their insight and impressions on the1web-novela innovation. The fotonovela concept is a scientifically supported and culturally-compatible health communications medium (11,12,13,14,15) and adapting it to use on the web and its social media applications constitutes an innovation in both the area of multi-culturally competent health communications and the expanding field of multimedia health education.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is significant, relevant and important to public health for three reasons: 1) The incidence and mortality rate of Latinas related to cervical cancer represents a startling health disparity and one that falls firmly under the1NCIs mission to eliminate the suffering and death due to cancer (17); 2) The web-novela innovation as a health communications tool falls under one of the NCI s stated areas of interest for 2010 as having potential for having the largest impact in improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer {16); and 3) This work will contribute to the body of research related to using the internet and social media for public health education and to find innovative and linguistically and culturally appropriate ways to reach populations who suffer from health disparities.           This project is significant, relevant and important to public health for three reasons: 1) The incidence and mortality rate of Latinas related to cervical cancer represents a startling health disparity and one that falls firmly under the1NCIs mission to eliminate the suffering and death due to cancer (17); 2) The web-novela innovation as a health communications tool falls under one of the NCI s stated areas of interest for 2010 as having potential for having the largest impact in improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer {16); and 3) This work will contribute to the body of research related to using the internet and social media for public health education and to find innovative and linguistically and culturally appropriate ways to reach populations who suffer from health disparities.         ",Bilingual Web-Novelas to Reach Young Latinas with Cervical Cancer Information,8199518,R43DP003849,[''],NCCDPHP,ACMA SOCIAL MARKETING,R43,2011,135600,0.15472439570827853
"A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among Pacific Islander Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among PI Women ABSTRACT  Despite the fact that cervical cancer is one of the most preventable of cancers, it remains one of the top five causes of cancer deaths in the U.S. and in California. The Pap test has been shown to be effective in not only detecting cancer but also precancerous cells. Even with the introduction of HPV testing and vaccines, Pap tests represent an important cervical cancer prevention and early detection method for women in this country. Unfortunately, the Pap test is severely underutilized among many ethnic and racial populations, including Pacific Islanders (PIs) who have high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality data among specific PI ethnic groups is sparse, with available information underscoring significant cancer health disparities. In California as in the Pacific, cervical cancer is one of the top five causes of cancer deaths. Given the dearth of PI researchers and studies at the NIH level, community-based participatory research (CBPR) holds the potential for engaging community cultural experts alongside cancer health disparities researchers to address their pressing cervical cancer detection needs.  This five year cluster unit randomized trial will develop and evaluate a social support intervention targeting both men and women to increase Pap testing decision making and behavior among Chamorro, Samoan and Tongan women age 18-65 years old in Southern California. We aim to: 1. Apply CBPR principles and processes for community/university partners throughout the grant period; 2. Develop and pretest two gender-specific and culturally tailored educational interventions for PI women and men. The interventions will be conducted separately by gender, and will employ a video, flipchart,  and brochure, along with small-group discussions facilitated by gender-matched community health  educators; 3. Develop and validate instruments measuring men's social support (provided), women's social support  (perceived) and women's decision making utility; 4. Recruit and randomly assign community-based organizational samples and recruit and follow the cohorts of PI females and males in the intervention and control groups 5. Examine the associations that test the conceptual model regarding social support, decision making  utility, and Pap testing intentions and behaviors; 6. Follow the cohort of PI women and men in the intervention vs. control groups to assess the impact of  the intervention. Using a longitudinal cohort design, we will identify, recruit, and randomly assign PI members of churches and other community-based organizations to one of two intervention options: a) a culturally tailored social support intervention group for women and men consisting of community health educator-facilitated video, flipchart and brochure; or b) a usual care control group, consisting of pre-existing cancer education materials (brochures) for PI women and men delivered by community health educators. We posit that the planned social support intervention will increase men's provision, and women's perceptions, of Pap testing social support, leading to increases in women's prioritization of Pap testing decision making utility and Pap testing behaviors.  The proposed study team involves long-standing university and community collaborators, and uses a multiple PI model to institutionalize shared participation and leadership structures. The community side of this CBPR study includes three CBOs with years of experience in health promotion, disease prevention, and collaborative research for their respective PI populations. The university side includes experienced behavioral scientists in CBPR, cancer control and decision making with multiethnic populations. This study will add to the existing science of cancer health disparities by adapting and applying well-established behavioral theories to understand the ways in which collectivist-oriented interventions influence individual women's cancer screening behavioral changes. Furthermore, this study will illuminate the CBPR engagement aspects necessary to conduct rigorous intervention research in small-size populations. The product of this study will be a culturally-tailored intervention that holds the potential to become a model for other collectivistic populations. Strengths of this study include: i) a focus on a major cancer health disparity; ii) development and testing of methods that are applicable to other health disparities; iii) a theoretical focus on decision making (a priority area for NCI regarding translational research); iv) an intervention approach that investigates and develops new strategies to improve cultural tailoring and evaluation; v) a focus on men; and vi) an ethnically diverse team of community and university investigators with an established track record in CBPR research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among Pacific Islander Women Project Narrative  Pacific Islanders (PIs) experience some of the highest cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in the U.S., yet little research exists on the ways to address and ameliorate their cancer health disparities.

"University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center Over 6 million new cases of sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPVs) infections are reported every year making HPV the most common sexually transmitted agent world-wide. At least 15 carcinogenic HPV types cause virtually all cervical cancers however; the costly HPV vaccine licensed in 2006 covers only HPV types 6/11/16/18 and has no therapeutic effect on established infections. Thus all women must continue routine cervical screening at a US cost of $4-5 billion annually. More importantly, the majority of women alive today are still at risk for developing cervical cancer. In addition, the current vaccine program presently leaves all men unprotected. Given these considerations and the fact that cervical cancer is a disease of disparities, it is unlikely that projected disease reductions will be realized with current strategies. Programs to characterize current US HPV vaccine implementation and effectiveness are needed and continuing efforts to better understand HPV biology and to develop broadly protective prevention strategies and therapeutics for existing infections remain critical. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To establish the University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center that incorporates research approaches to address these gaps in knowledge. 2) To fund and support 4 projects representing a spectrum of interdisciplinary approaches including: A) modeling of PV-host interactions in 3 dimensions to define elements of epithelial cell biology and immunity that contribute to the pathogenesis and prevention of infections; B) utilizing novel vaccine strategies based on virus-display technology to generate broad protection against a majority of HPV infections; C) utilizing a unique bioinformatics system that captures all events of a US population-based cervical screening program to characterize implementation and effectiveness of primary and secondary HPV interventions; and D) developing a set of web-based tools to promote the informed adoption of HPV and other STI prevention. 3) To establish 2 cores housing shared resources to support these interdisciplinary research approaches: A) a biostatistics and bioinformatics core and B) a virus infection core supporting technologies for virus production, quantitation, and animal imaging and housing a biospecimen resource. The University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary STI Prevention Center will focus on the most common sexually transmitted agents, human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. To maximally realize improvements in HPV prevention, the Center will partner basic biological discovery, technological advancements, population-based effectiveness and diffusion of interventions across laboratory, clinical & real-world settings.",University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center,8133011,U19AI084081,[''],NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,U19,2011,2882024,0.22685487790519893
"Understanding Health Disparities in cervical dysplasia and cancer through the ide    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in women in developing nations. When stratified by race in United States, African American and Hispanic women have both higher incidence and mortality from cervical cancer than Caucasian women. These disparities are in part due to access to healthcare and screening, but even after accounting for this, African American and Hispanic women continue to have higher mortality rates. This grant application describes potential biomarkers that may help begin to understand the differences in progression of the preneoplastic stages of cervical cancer between African American, Hispanic, Caucasian women. The identification of such biomarkers will help determine the biological basis for the observed disparities in the incidences as well as mortality of cervical cancer. In addition, these biomarkers will be useful to identify, among the many women who present with Pap test abnormalities, the few that are at high risk of developing cancer. This will allow for considerable reduction in morbidity as well as cost savings in Pap test follow-up procedures, at the same time providing better, more aggressive care to those who truly need it.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The incidence of cervical cancer is 50% higher in African American women and 66% higher in Hispanic women with mortality rates two-fold higher than what is found in Caucasian women. The disparities among races in part can be attributed to differences in screening and access to healthcare, but after controlling for these factors these disparities persist suggesting that there may be individual susceptibilities to HPV infections. The overall goal of our research is to identify biomarkers that can help predict which women are at highest risk for developing cervical cancer, thus reducing the health disparities that exist for cervical cancer.            The incidence of cervical cancer is 50% higher in African American women and 66% higher in Hispanic women with mortality rates two-fold higher than what is found in Caucasian women.

"Disparities in cervical cancer precursors and deregulation of imprinted genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although screening for uterine cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN) and its aggressive treatment has resulted in decreased cervical cancer incidence and mortality, an estimated 11,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) and 40,000 cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS) continue to be diagnosed every year in the United States. ICC incidence is 60% higher and mortality over two times higher in African Americans compared to whites. Such disparate rates in incidence and mortality are despite comparable screening rates to detect precursor lesions, comparable prevalence of 'high risk' human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the etiologic agent, and co-factors such as cigarette smoking. Reasons for such disparities are largely unknown. A more detailed understanding of the etiology of lesions that progress will improve risk stratification to distinguish women with a low risk of progression from those likely to rapidly progress to invasive cancer. We posit that deregulation of genomically imprinted genes, a group of approximately 50 known growth-regulatory genes where only one allele is normally active, may predict progression to cervical cancer. We found that a substantial group of imprinted genes exhibit altered expression in ICC versus normal cervical epithelium. In addition, methylation analysis of two regulatory regions controlling IGF2 expression shows deviation from normal in specimens with CIN2-CIN3 classification and more profound deviation in invasive cancers. Together, these findings suggest that imprinted genes are deregulated in ICC and these features may improve detection of CIN cases likely to progress. Our central hypothesis is that deregulation at imprint regulatory elements of imprinted genes, likely influenced by environmental exposures, increases risk of progression to cervical cancer in women infected with 'high risk' HPV. We have already shown racial variation on the effect of environmental exposures on imprint deregulation, and thus, further hypothesize that higher risk in African Americans and Hispanics is due to race/ethnic differences in deregulation of these genes. Our specific aims are to: (1) determine if deregulation of imprint regulatory elements of known imprinted genes is associated with increased risk of progression of CIN1 to CIN2+, and whether this association varies by race/ethnicity; (2) determine whether aberrant methylation of imprint regulatory elements in cervical cells is similar to that found in peripheral blood cells, suggesting an early event; and associated with (i) transcriptional expression, and (ii) loss of imprinting; (3) evaluate whether deregulation of known imprinted genes in cervical cells can be used to discriminate women with CIN2+ among 500 Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance (ASCUS) cases. To address the Aims, we will recruit and follow 1,500 women with CIN1 and 500 with ASCUS, and examine the association between aberrant methylation markers at imprinted regulatory elements of 12 genes and progression from CIN1 to CIN2+. We will then test the performance of these markers to identify CIN2+ cases from among 500 ASCUS cases. Data from the proposed study will improve triage decisions and reduce disparities in ICC morbidity and mortality.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although screening for cervical intraepithelial lesions to prevent cervical cancer has resulted in decreased cancer incidence and mortality, an estimated 11,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer and 40,000 carcinomas in situ cases continue to be diagnosed every year in the United States with incidence 60% higher and mortality >2-times higher in African Americans compared to whites. We will recruit and follow 1,500 CIN1 and 500 cases of Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance (ASCUS), and examine the association between aberrant methylation at imprinted regulatory elements of 12 genes and progression to CIN2 or worse and then test the performance of these markers in ASCUS cases, independent of known co-factors. Data from this study will elucidate the role of epigenetic deregulation in CIN2+ and inform triage decisions, reducing disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality.

"Kin Keeper:Reducing Disparities Through Cancer Literacy and Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of the phenomena health disparities requires researchers and public health educators to use many strategies to devise ways of reducing disparities and implement programs with the goal of eliminating those disparities. We are proposing to focus on breast and cervical cancer screening among Black, Latina, and Arab women living in the United States. This will be done by investigating the effectiveness of the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention, a female-family focused educational intervention for medically underserved women applied in a real world setting, using a randomized control trial design. The Kin KeeperSM model uses synergy and natural communication that exists among female family members to increase cancer prevention education and screening, which translates into functional cancer literacy. Simultaneously we will be using a two-step approach that also includes measuring the cost of the intervention, which is in important if the model is going to be sustained and have public utility in decreasing and ultimately eliminating cancer disparities. The goals of this research project are: 1) To determine if the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention increases first time and appropriately timed breast cancer screening rates among Black, Latina, and Arab women; 2) To determine if the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention increases first time and appropriately timed cervical cancer screening rates among Black, Latina, and Arab women; 3) To measure functional cancer literacy over time at the individual and family level and; 4) To assess costs and rates of health care utilization among women in the Kin KeeperSM model and the comparison group. By combining a community based approach with our university-community partnership as well as health services research methodology, we anticipate that we will have sustainable model to impact breast and cervical cancer disparities among medically underserved women.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this research will impact public health agencies and research on planning and intervention design; as to more effectively promote breast and cervical cancer screening and early detection for medically underserved women.

"Patn?? en Aksyon: Addressing Cervical Cancer Disparities in Little Haiti    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patne en Aksyon (Partners in Action) is a well-established campus community partnership between the University of Miami and key Haitian community-based organizations in South Florida. Over the past four and a half years, Partnership members have been actively engaged in a Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) initiative to address the disproportionate burden of cervical cancer in Little Haiti, the predominately Haitian neighborhood in Miami. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in Little Haiti are significantly higher than elsewhere in the Miami metropolitan area, including other, low income, minority neighborhoods. As part of our effort to attenuate this disparity, we have learned about twalet deba, a feminine hygiene practice designed to cleanse, dry, and tighten the vagina for disease prevention and enhanced sexual pleasure of male partners. We believe, though have not yet empirically verified, that this practice may actually increase susceptibility to Human Papillomavirus (HPV), the principal cause of cervical cancer. The proposed research aims to fill this gap in understanding. We have planned a two-year exploratory study that integrates mixed methodologies. Indigenous Community Health Workers, or Ajan Fanm, will collect all study data. Integrating the Ajan Fanm into our study design is consistent with the tenets of CBPR and essential for achieving study aims, given their intimate knowledge of cultural norms related to the discussion of health and other sensitive topics. In the first phase of research, the Ajan Fanm will employ participant observation and in-depth interviewing techniques to better understand the socio-cultural significance of twalet deba, and how this practice is intricately tied to male-female relationships, lay perceptions of health and illness causation, and sexuality. Information learned from these data will inform the second phase of the proposed research. In this phase of inquiry, the Ajan Fanm will interview 250 Haitian women, and teach them to use a simple self- sampling device to collect a cervical specimen for HPV testing and cytology. This device has similar efficacy to the Pap smear, but it can be self-administered in the privacy of one's home, circumventing socio-cultural concerns about modesty prevalent among Haitian women. The cervical specimens will be evaluated by a certified pathologist for cytologic changes and tested for HPV using the Hologic/Third Wave Invader assay. In this exploratory study, our primary objective is to improve understanding about twalet deba and its potential association with HPV to inform future research and intervention that may attenuate the excess risk of cervical cancer in Little Haiti and other medically underserved, ethnic enclaves.

"Team Activation To Increase HPV Vaccination Rates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Certain segments of the population have increased cancer incidence and mortality rates because they have not benefited equally from the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, cancer screening, and the follow-up of abnormal tests. Examples of groups still experiencing increased cancer rates are African Americans and low socioeconomic populations. In addition, these populations have increased HPV prevalence rates. Since HPV is a problem in these groups, ways to address increased HPV rates are needed.  A health disparities research team at The Ohio State University in partnership with the Columbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc. (CNHC), a federally qualified health center, proposes to develop an educational program, STOP (Share, Train, Organize, to Prevent) HPV, aimed at reducing HPV-associated diseases by improving HPV vaccination rates among female and male adolescents (age 9-18). The goal of this proposal is to develop, refine, and test the feasibility of a culturally appropriate multi-level educational program intended for parents (level 1) of adolescents who seek care at a CNHC, the healthcare team (physicians, nurses, assistants, and staff) (level 2) at the CNHC, and the health center (level 3) to increase HPV vaccination rates among adolescents. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) Develop a multi-level HPV vaccine educational intervention directed at parents, providers/staff, and the health center that includes: (a) sharing information about HPV, HPV-associated cancers and diseases, and the HPV vaccine; (b) communication skills training to improve parent-provider conversations about the HPV vaccine; and (c) organizational level components to increase vaccination rates; and (2) Test the feasibility of the multi-level HPV vaccine educational intervention among 10 parents of adolescent females and 10 parents of adolescent males, providers/staff, and one health center. Specific aims will be carried out in partnership with parents, healthcare providers and staff from two CNHCs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are health disparities associated with cancer in the United States partially due to increased human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence rates among certain population groups.

"REACH UP & OUT: Eliminating Breast and Cervical Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been well documented that disparities exist between African American and white women with regard to morbidity and mortality associated with breast and cervical cancer. We have established a very active coalition, conducted comprehensive needs assessments, and developed and pilot-tested a community action plan to reduce breast and cervical cancer screening disparities between white and African American women in Alabama's Black Belt. Although effective and well received by the community, this intervention did not lead to behavior change among all women within the targeted population. The overall purpose of the proposed intervention is to further reduce breast and cervical cancer disparities between white and African American women in the Black Belt of Alabama by increasing Pap smear and mammography rates. We propose to develop and implement a multi-component intervention that uses media, education, and enhanced access, incorporating sociological and cognitive behavioral approaches in the development and implementation of the messages. This intervention is an extension of our pilot work utilizing community health advisors (CHAs) (sociologic approach). Although the pilot intervention showed significant increase in breast and cervical cancer screening among African American women in the Black Belt, there is still a hard to-reach group, which, despite our efforts, has not engaged in breast and cervical cancer screening. Based on the results of follow-up interviews with this group of women and discussions with our coalition members and CHAs, we propose the development, implementation, and evaluation of an enhanced intervention, which incorporates cognitive behavioral approaches that will challenge the barriers (e.g., fear of finding out they have cancer, the belief that screening will not make any difference) and reinforce the motivators (e.g., support from other women) to engage this group in breast and cervical cancer screening. Although the Community-Based Participatory Research and the Empowerment Model will be the overall conceptual framework used in this study, the PEN-3 and the Health Belief Model will guide intervention development and implementation. The intervention counties will receive education and cognitive/behavioral skills training delivered by CHAs, while the control counties will continue to receive our current intervention that has proven to be successful. The study will be carried out in two phases. In Phase I, we will refine the enhanced intervention and assessment tools through formative assessment. In Phase II, we will randomly assign the counties to intervention/control groups, implement, and evaluate the intervention.          ",REACH UP & OUT: Eliminating Breast and Cervical Cancer Disparities,8039194,R24MD002747,"['cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Target Populations ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' skills training ', ' behavior change ', ' Community Health ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Community Actions ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' empowerment ', ' community intervention ', ' Alabama ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Phase ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Behavioral ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Control Groups ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' tool ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' County ', ' Testing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Woman ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' base ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Work ', ' Evaluation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' Interview ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Belief ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R24,2011,571380,0.1337166819008851
"Geographic access to care and HPV vaccine uptake among ethnic minority girls    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer disproportionately affects minority, immigrant, and low income women. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have the potential to substantially prevent high-risk HPV infections and future cases of cervical cancer. However, recent studies show that HPV vaccine uptake in high risk groups remains low. Even with available programs that provide the vaccine for free to low income populations, multiple barriers, such as lack of geographic/spatial accessibility to safety-net immunization clinics, may prevent disadvantaged girls from obtaining the HPV vaccine. Current disparities in cervical cancer will likely persist as a result of HPV vaccine under-utilization among low income, ethnic minority populations. This cross-sectional study will examine geographic/spatial access to care and neighborhood factors, in addition to individual level factors, that influence HPV vaccine initiation (receiving e 1 dose of the HPV vaccine) among low-income, minority girls in Los Angeles County (LAC). The study will build on primary data collected from mothers of HPV vaccine age-eligible girls who primarily reside in disadvantaged areas of LAC and routinely access the county safety-net system. This individual-level data will be linked at the census tract level to neighborhood socio-demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau and neighborhood cervical cancer risk data from the LAC Sexually Transmitted Diseases Program. Geographic information systems mapping techniques will be employed to create geographic/spatial access measures (shortest travel distance to clinic, coverage of e 1 clinic within a 3-mile radius of household) using residential addresses of vaccine age-eligible girls and locations of safety-net immunization clinics. The study will evaluate whether spatial access to immunization clinics is associated with HPV vaccine initiation, as well as whether the relationship between spatial access and vaccine initiation is modified by individual race/ethnicity, while controlling for other individual level risk factors. Hierarchical logistical regression modeling will also be used to assess the impact of neighborhood factors (socio-demographic characteristics and cervical cancer risk), in addition to spatial access and individual level risk factors, on HPV vaccine initiation. The study is unique in that it moves beyond individual level predictors to assess geographic and neighborhood factors that impact HPV vaccine initiation in an underserved, urban population. Study results will inform local county health officials about factors that contribute to low HPV vaccine utilization and provide information relevant to resource allocation decisions for cancer prevention and control programs in LAC. Results will also inform health policymakers and researchers on geographically based interventions that could improve HPV vaccine uptake.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine the impact of geographic/spatial access to safety-net immunization clinics and other neighborhood socio-demographic and cervical cancer risk factors on HPV vaccine initiation among low- income, ethnic minority girls in Los Angeles County. Individual survey data, collected from mothers of HPV vaccine age-eligible girls, will be combined with data from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health STD Program and the U.S. Census Bureau to conduct geographic information systems (GIS) mapping and multi-level analysis. Findings will provide an understanding of how spatial and neighborhood factors influence HPV vaccine uptake in a large urban setting and inform cervical cancer control programs and policies.            This study will examine the impact of geographic/spatial access to safety-net immunization clinics and other neighborhood socio-demographic and cervical cancer risk factors on HPV vaccine initiation among low- income, ethnic minority girls in Los Angeles County.

"Reducing Cervical Cancer in Appalachia In response to RFA ES-02-009, a multi-disciplinary group of investigators from the Ohio State University and the University of Michigan have collaborated to propose a Center for Population Health and Health Disparities focusing on an important health issue in underserved populations,cancer. The Center will initially focus on the goal of understanding why high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are observed in Appalachia Ohio, a mainly rural area in Southern and Eastern Ohio. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research within the framework of the Social Determinants of Health model in three inter-related projects and four supporting cores. All studies will be conducted in 16 clinics which represent the general population of women aged 18 and older in the region. We will utilize the Center's internal and external advisory committees and community partners organized into a community advisory board and Consortium of communityorganizations to facilitate the accomplishment of project goals. Project 1 will recruit 1600 women to an observational study to  investigate multi-level (social, environmental, behavioral, and biological) correlates of ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization, in Phase I. From this cohort of women, those who smoke (30%) will be eligible to participate in Project 2, which tests the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote smoking cessation (behavioral) and validate cessation endpoints with saliva cotinine measurements (biological) in a quasi-experimental trial design; those women who are in need of & Pap test (48% of 1600) will be eligible to participate in Phase II of Project 1 which will test the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization (behavioral) and follow-up for abnormalities (biological) detected in a quasi-experimental trial design. Project 3 will examine the contribution of HPV (biological) to cervical abnormalities in Appalachia in relation to individual-level behaviors (e.g. smoking, sexual activity) within the social and environmental region of Appalachia in a case-control observational study among women who have Pap smears in these 16 clinics.The research will be supported by four cores: A) Administration - fiscal and Center oversight; B) Biostatistics and Data Resources - sample selection, data management, data analysis, and population data resources; C) Clinical Correlative Sciences - collect, obtain and process biomarker specimens; and D) Behavioral Assessment and Intervention - train interviewers and lay health educators, conduct interviews, design intervention material, and facilitate  communication amongst sites. The Center includes a mechanism for pilot project solicitation, review and funding. This Center has institutional commitment in terms of personnel, funds and space, as well as, a commitment to focus on the problem of health disparities in the region. Finally, members of the team have worked together in the past in various settings that focus on the goals of the proposed Center and have an established relationship in Appalachian Ohio for the purpose of improving the health of the population. Future work of this Center will focus on moving this type of multi-level observational and interventional community-based research, into other areas where health disparities exist in relation to cancer withinour region. Cervical cancer disparities exist among women in Appalachia. Our previous work has found that the prevalence of factors known to cause cervical cancer e.g. tobacco use, genetic predisposition, HPV infection, and stress due to economic conditions, are disproportionately higher in this population. This Center, CARE II, proposes to use a transdisciplinary research team in conjunction with community partners, to address and reduce this health disparity.",Reducing Cervical Cancer in Appalachia,8068367,P50CA105632,[''],NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,P50,2011,2273059,0.1361020981051039
"Promoting cancer screening for mothers using a daughter-initiated approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dr. Mosavel's career goal is to establish herself as an independent investigator in cancer control and behavioral research with a focus on African-Americans in low-income neighborhoods. The goal of this application is to integrate a strong mentoring, training, and focused research agenda to enable her to: 1) become an independent health disparities researcher who conducts large scale, community-based behavioral cancer interventions and 2) develop and strengthen her mixed methods skill set to effectively evaluate cancer interventions. The research plan examines the feasibility of the mother and adolescent daughter dyad, particularly from low-income, African-American households, as a unique portal within which to communicate critical cancer prevention and control information. The prevailing health promotion paradigm is that parents give their children advice about health. Consequently, there has been minimal focus on the influence that adolescents can have on their parents' health behaviors. The present study will focus on assessing the daughters' ability to influence their mothers' cancer screening behaviors. There are three specific aims. The first aim is to explore and identify the necessary conditions for effective giving and receiving of breast and cervical cancer information within the mother-daughter dyad. The second aim is to   design the delivery and evaluate the comprehension, credibility and emotional response associated with the daughter-initiated cancer message. Finally, the third aim is to conduct a study of a daughter-focused intervention to examine its effect on mothers' breast and cervical cancer screening behaviors. This study has the potential to utilize the assets of the mother-daughter dyad and promote cancer dialogue in the family. Consequently, a daughter-initiated intervention may have a significant impact on mothers' health behavior. Mothers who receive guided support and encouragement from their daughters may be more responsive to cancer screening messages and more likely to obtain a Pap smear and mammogram when compared to mothers who do not. Likewise, adolescent daughters who are provided with opportunities to discuss cancer prevention may, in turn, grow more knowledgeable and intent on eventually obtaining a Pap smear and mammogram. The proposed research will highlight the conditions that will lead to effective mother-daughter communication about breast and cervical cancer and an understanding of the processes related to this information sharing. Finally, the findings from the proposed research will lead to subsequent R21 and R01 community-based cancer intervention research.             ",Promoting cancer screening for mothers using a daughter-initiated approach,8117270,K01CA132960,"['Cancer Intervention ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Household ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Comprehension ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Intention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' African ', ' Motivation ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Mentors ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Mothers ', ' Woman ', ' Incidence ', ' Training ', ' Emotional ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Goals ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Outcome ', ' career ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' base ', ' Family ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Future ', ' skills ', ' randomized trial ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Affect ', ' Literature ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Low income ', ' Prevalence ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Data ', ' Time ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Behavioral ', ' programs ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' improved ', ' Knowledge ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Health behavior ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Behavior ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Communities ', ' Communication ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Methods ', ' Process ', ' Elements ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Household Heads ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Daughter ', ' parental influence ', ' parent influence ', ' ']",NCI,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,K01,2011,134460,0.09332401619075449
"An HPV Health Communication Randomized Controlled Trial Intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Sherrie Wallington, PhD, MA, Assistant Professor of Oncology;, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC), Georgetown University (GUMC) Medical Center, Washington, DC. Dr. Wallington's chief academic and research goal is to transition to independence as a social and behavioral scientist investigating the role of health communication to address cancer health disparities.     Environment: Georgetown University's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center is a high-quality research environment and is well suited for the success of Dr. Wallington's career development experience, proposed research, and her transition to an independent scientist. In the event of an award, the institution is committed to ensuring that Dr. Wallington fulfills all the requirement of this award, as detailed in the Director's letter (see Institutional Environment component of this proposal).    Research: This proposed research emphasizes the need to increase knowledge of the human papillomavirous (HPV) and the HPV vaccine among low-income African-American mothers, a population that lacks HPV knowledge and has a high incidence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is estimated to be the most common sexually transmitted infection. High-risk HPV types can cause cervical, anal, and other genital cancers. However, public awareness and understanding of the sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses and the available HPV vaccine are low, particularly among racial ethnic minorities and women of low socioeconomic status. In the District of Columbia (DC), legislation passed in 2007 mandates that all female students enrolling in the sixth grade at a DC school must received the HPV vaccine or not received the HPV vaccine because of an opt-out clause. Many DC parents and community groups have questioned the efficacy of the vaccine, the clarity of the current opt-out form, and the failure of DC to provide a visible HPV public information campaign. DC has the highest cervical cancer rates in the United States. This lack of HPV education is leading to significant knowledge gaps and communication inequalities, particularly among minority and underserved populations, in the access to information and the inability of parents to make informed decisions with balanced and accurate information. To achieve a significant effect on combating cervical cancer, eliminating HPV knowledge gaps is essential. One strategy is to first educate mothers. Thus, this study seeks to develop a health communication randomized controlled HPV educational intervention in DC that targets African-American mothers who have unvaccinated daughters between the ages of 9 and 17. Participants will be randomized into one of two arms, a group intervention arm or a wait-listed control group arm. The specific aims and hypotheses to be tested are: Aim 1: To conduct a randomized controlled trial health communication intervention to increase knowledge awareness about HPV and the HPV vaccine among low socioeconomic status African-American mothers. H1: African-American mothers receiving the group educational intervention will have greater HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge awareness compared to the wait-listed control group; and Aim 2: To assess the factors associated with mothers acceptability or non-acceptability of the HPV vaccine for their daughters. H2: Mothers receiving the group educational intervention will have greater HPV vaccine acceptability for their daughters than the wait-listed control group. Findings from this research will assist with translating and disseminating HPV evidenced-based findings to a population with low HPV knowledge awareness and high cervical cancer rates thereby addressing the important goal of reducing and eliminating cervical cancer disparities. [H3: Daughters of mothers receiving the group educational intervention will have a higher rate of vaccine uptake than daughters of mothers in the control group.]      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this research is that it seeks to translate and disseminate evidence-based findings about HPV to a population with a heavy burden of cervical cancer and represents an extraordinary opportunity to reduce and eliminate HPV and cervical cancer disparities.           The public health relevance of this research is that it seeks to translate and disseminate evidence-based findings about HPV to a population with a heavy burden of cervical cancer and represents an extraordinary opportunity to reduce and eliminate HPV and cervical cancer disparities.         ",An HPV Health Communication Randomized Controlled Trial Intervention,8190205,K01CA155417,"['Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' outreach to information ', ' Access to Information ', ' urogenital system (genital part) ', ' Genital ', ' Genital system ', ' vaccine efficacy ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Letters ', ' group intervention ', ' Washington ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Licensing ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Awareness ', ' Research Support ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Vaccines ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' high school ', ' Ensure ', ' Students ', ' respiratory ', ' Reading ', ' Control Groups ', ' Medical center ', ' Cities ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' arm ', ' Minority ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Health Communication ', ' Benign ', ' Mothers ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' public health relevance ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' professor ', ' Cervical ', ' Low income ', ' Commit ', ' career development ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Award ', ' Institution ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' evidence base ', ' social ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' combat ', ' Individual ', ' Infection ', ' Population ', ' Knowledge ', ' Participant ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Research ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Communities ', ' Event ', ' Woman ', ' Address ', ' Communication ', ' uptake ', ' Science ', ' Dose ', ' Cells ', ' Female ', ' Age ', ' high risk ', ' United States ', ' Parents ', ' experience ', ' Universities ', ' Scientist ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Exposure to ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Medical ', ' Schools ', ' Environment ', ' member ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Process ', ' Incidence ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Behavioral ', ' Goals ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Inequality ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Venereal Warts ', ' Genital Warts ', ' Condylomata Acuminata ', ' Condyloma Accuminata ', ' Anogenital venereal warts ', ' Link ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Risk ', ' meetings ', ' success ', ' Family ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Message Framing and HPV Vaccination Acceptance among African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant racial disparities exist in the incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer in the US, despite an overall decline in these rates for the population as a whole. In particular, African American women are significantly more likely to get and die from cervical cancer than non-Hispanic White women. African Americans, however, are also among the group that holds the least favorable attitudes toward the new human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine recommended for young women to prevent cervical cancer. There is a tremendous need for developing effective communication interventions about HPV vaccination targeting caretakers of vaccine-eligible young African American women. Previous research indicates that framing a health message in terms of the benefits that may be achieved by performing the recommended behavior versus the costs that may be incurred by not following the recommendation could systematically influence message efficacy. Despite extensive research on message framing, little is known about the effects of message framing on HPV vaccination acceptance among caretakers of vaccine-eligible young African American women and the extent to which these effects may be moderated by the caretakers' vaccine-related beliefs such as perceived vaccine safety and efficacy. To advance scientific knowledge on how message framing can be used to foster HPV vaccination acceptance in African American communities, we will conduct a community-based randomized trial with 150 caretakers of vaccine-eligible young African American women ages 9-17 to assess the relative efficacy of gain- vs. loss-framed messages. The proposed project will provide useful insights into the design of targeted messages to improve HPV vaccination acceptance among caretakers of vaccine-eligible young African American women. This study will also set the stage for a program of research aimed at developing theory-based communication interventions for promoting HPV vaccination in African American communities, with the ultimate goal of reducing and eliminating racial disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The primary objective of the proposed study is to test the relative efficacy of two communication strategies in promoting HPV vaccination acceptance among caretakers of vaccine-eligible young African American women. If successful, this project will help understand message framing effects in the promotion of HPV vaccination and provide useful insights into the design of targeted messages to improve HPV vaccination acceptance among caretakers of vaccine-eligible young African American women.        The primary objective of the proposed study is to test the relative efficacy of two communication strategies in promoting HPV vaccination acceptance among caretakers of vaccine-eligible young African American women.

"Better Breast and Cervical Cancer Control for Korean American Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite considerable progress made in U.S. cancer control during the past 20 years, certain ethnic minority groups continue to experience significant health disparities. Breast and cervical cancer screening rates for Korean American (KA) women are far below the national goal, and below rates reported for other ethnic groups. As a result, KA women are often diagnosed at a later stage of cancer which can lead to a poor prognosis, high mortality, and subsequent emotional and financial burdens. Limited health literacy is emerging as a far-reaching, major barrier to cancer prevention behaviors, particularly among non-English speaking immigrant populations. This research application is formulated to answer research questions that address critical knowledge gaps in cancer control intervention research for linguistically and/or socially isolated ethnic minority communities using the KA community as an example. These questions are: (1) whether a health literacy-focused intervention using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) process will be effective in promoting health literacy and increasing breast and cervical cancer screening rates among KA women; and (2) whether a tailored intervention delivered by community health workers (CHWs) will be effective in such a community. The proposed study is a community-based, cluster-randomized clinical trial with two parallel arms, with a delayed intervention. A longitudinal repeated measures design will allow us to determine the effectiveness of the proposed health literacy-focused tailored cancer control intervention delivered by CHWs. A total of 480 KA women will participate in the study. The primary outcome of this study will be adherence to breast and cervical cancer screening. We hypothesize that, as compared to KA women in the control (delayed intervention) group, KA women who receive our literacy-focused tailored CHW intervention will demonstrate higher levels of adherence to screening for breast and cervical cancer. Through implementation of these research activities, we expect to establish a mechanism for disseminating critical health information for this population and to enhance a community network which will facilitate community access to breast and cervical cancer screening. While the focus of this research project is health literacy promotion and breast and cervical cancer screening among KA women, the core principles and methodology of this intervention can provide insights toward development of effective, culturally sensitive health literacy programs to meet the needs of socially and/or linguistically isolated minority groups with inadequate cancer control throughout the United States. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE: Korean American (KA) women have the second highest incidence of cervical cancer nationally and are experiencing rapid increases in breast cancer incidence. Limited capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions (i.e., limited health literacy) is a major barrier to early detection of cancer among KA women. This study proposes to test if a health literacy-focused intervention using a community- based participatory research process will be effective in promoting health literacy and increasing breast and cervical cancer screening rates among KA women; and (2) whether a tailored intervention delivered by trained community health workers will be effective in such a community.

"Disparities in cervical cancer precursors and deregulation of imprinted genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although screening for uterine cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN) and its aggressive treatment has resulted in decreased cervical cancer incidence and mortality, an estimated 11,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) and 40,000 cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS) continue to be diagnosed every year in the United States. ICC incidence is 60% higher and mortality over two times higher in African Americans compared to whites. Such disparate rates in incidence and mortality are despite comparable screening rates to detect precursor lesions, comparable prevalence of 'high risk' human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the etiologic agent, and co-factors such as cigarette smoking. Reasons for such disparities are largely unknown. A more detailed understanding of the etiology of lesions that progress will improve risk stratification to distinguish women with a low risk of progression from those likely to rapidly progress to invasive cancer. We posit that deregulation of genomically imprinted genes, a group of approximately 50 known growth-regulatory genes where only one allele is normally active, may predict progression to cervical cancer. We found that a substantial group of imprinted genes exhibit altered expression in ICC versus normal cervical epithelium. In addition, methylation analysis of two regulatory regions controlling IGF2 expression shows deviation from normal in specimens with CIN2-CIN3 classification and more profound deviation in invasive cancers. Together, these findings suggest that imprinted genes are deregulated in ICC and these features may improve detection of CIN cases likely to progress. Our central hypothesis is that deregulation at imprint regulatory elements of imprinted genes, likely influenced by environmental exposures, increases risk of progression to cervical cancer in women infected with 'high risk' HPV. We have already shown racial variation on the effect of environmental exposures on imprint deregulation, and thus, further hypothesize that higher risk in African Americans and Hispanics is due to race/ethnic differences in deregulation of these genes. Our specific aims are to: (1) determine if deregulation of imprint regulatory elements of known imprinted genes is associated with increased risk of progression of CIN1 to CIN2+, and whether this association varies by race/ethnicity; (2) determine whether aberrant methylation of imprint regulatory elements in cervical cells is similar to that found in peripheral blood cells, suggesting an early event; and associated with (i) transcriptional expression, and (ii) loss of imprinting; (3) evaluate whether deregulation of known imprinted genes in cervical cells can be used to discriminate women with CIN2+ among 500 Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance (ASCUS) cases. To address the Aims, we will recruit and follow 1,500 women with CIN1 and 500 with ASCUS, and examine the association between aberrant methylation markers at imprinted regulatory elements of 12 genes and progression from CIN1 to CIN2+. We will then test the performance of these markers to identify CIN2+ cases from among 500 ASCUS cases. Data from the proposed study will improve triage decisions and reduce disparities in ICC morbidity and mortality.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although screening for cervical intraepithelial lesions to prevent cervical cancer has resulted in decreased cancer incidence and mortality, an estimated 11,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer and 40,000 carcinomas in situ cases continue to be diagnosed every year in the United States with incidence 60% higher and mortality >2-times higher in African Americans compared to whites. We will recruit and follow 1,500 CIN1 and 500 cases of Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance (ASCUS), and examine the association between aberrant methylation at imprinted regulatory elements of 12 genes and progression to CIN2 or worse and then test the performance of these markers in ASCUS cases, independent of known co-factors.

"HPV Vaccination in the Cambodian Community    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Virtually all cancers of the cervix are caused by HPV infection. Several HPV vaccines (that could prevent 70 percent of all cervical cancers) have been approved for American girls and young women. The majority of Cambodian Americans came to the US as immigrants and over one-half have limited English proficiency. Women of Southeast Asian descent have higher cervical cancer incidence rates than any other racial/ethnic group, and the incidence among Cambodians is twice the incidence among non-Hispanic whites (15.0 versus 7.7 per 100,000). The study goal is to conduct mixed-methods research that could be used to inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of culturally appropriate HPV vaccination interventions targeting Cambodian women with daughters in the 9-17 age group. Qualitative and quantitative methods should both be used to examine determinants of preventive health practices in Southeast Asian and other immigrant groups. Our primary objectives are: to provide qualitative data relevant to the promotion of HPV vaccine use in Cambodian communities; and quantitative data about the uptake of HPV vaccination among Cambodian adolescents, as well as correlates of HPV vaccine uptake. A recent review of HPV vaccine surveillance in the US found no publications addressing the reliability of self-reported HPV vaccine uptake. Our secondary objective is to assess the test-retest reliability of survey measures addressing HPV vaccine uptake in a Cambodian study group. Our community-based participatory research will build on a long-standing collaboration with the Cambodian community. An existing Cambodian Community Coalition will serve as the community advisory board for the project. Cambodian women who have a daughter in the 9-17 age group and live in the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area will be included in this study. Our research will use the theoretical perspective of the Health Behavior Framework. Qualitative and quantitative study phases will be conducted sequentially. We will complete 25 qualitative interviews with Cambodian mothers. Qualitative data findings will be used to guide the development of a quantitative survey instrument. A community-based telephone survey of 200 Cambodian mothers will be conducted, and a sub-sample of 50 survey participants will be asked to complete a retest survey.        This project will provide valuable qualitative and quantitative information about HPV vaccination in the Cambodian community. Project findings could be used to guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of culturally appropriate HPV vaccination educational materials and intervention programs for Cambodian Americans.

"Reducing Cervical Cancer in Appalachia In response to RFA ES-02-009, a multi-disciplinary group of investigators from the Ohio State University and the University of Michigan have collaborated to propose a Center for Population Health and Health Disparities focusing on an important health issue in underserved populations,cancer. The Center will initially focus on the goal of understanding why high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are observed in Appalachia Ohio, a mainly rural area in Southern and Eastern Ohio. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research within the framework of the Social Determinants of Health model in three inter-related projects and four supporting cores. All studies will be conducted in 16 clinics which represent the general population of women aged 18 and older in the region. We will utilize the Center's internal and external advisory committees and community partners organized into a community advisory board and Consortium of communityorganizations to facilitate the accomplishment of project goals. Project 1 will recruit 1600 women to an observational study to  investigate multi-level (social, environmental, behavioral, and biological) correlates of ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization, in Phase I. From this cohort of women, those who smoke (30%) will be eligible to participate in Project 2, which tests the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote smoking cessation (behavioral) and validate cessation endpoints with saliva cotinine measurements (biological) in a quasi-experimental trial design; those women who are in need of & Pap test (48% of 1600) will be eligible to participate in Phase II of Project 1 which will test the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization (behavioral) and follow-up for abnormalities (biological) detected in a quasi-experimental trial design. Project 3 will examine the contribution of HPV (biological) to cervical abnormalities in Appalachia in relation to individual-level behaviors (e.g. smoking, sexual activity) within the social and environmental region of Appalachia in a case-control observational study among women who have Pap smears in these 16 clinics.The research will be supported by four cores: A) Administration - fiscal and Center oversight; B) Biostatistics and Data Resources - sample selection, data management, data analysis, and population data resources; C) Clinical Correlative Sciences - collect, obtain and process biomarker specimens; and D) Behavioral Assessment and Intervention - train interviewers and lay health educators, conduct interviews, design intervention material, and facilitate  communication amongst sites. The Center includes a mechanism for pilot project solicitation, review and funding. This Center has institutional commitment in terms of personnel, funds and space, as well as, a commitment to focus on the problem of health disparities in the region. Finally, members of the team have worked together in the past in various settings that focus on the goals of the proposed Center and have an established relationship in Appalachian Ohio for the purpose of improving the health of the population. Future work of this Center will focus on moving this type of multi-level observational and interventional community-based research, into other areas where health disparities exist in relation to cancer withinour region. Cervical cancer disparities exist among women in Appalachia. Our previous work has found that the prevalence of factors known to cause cervical cancer e.g. tobacco use, genetic predisposition, HPV infection, and stress due to economic conditions, are disproportionately higher in this population.

"HPV Vaccine Education Intervention for Medically Underserved High-risk Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a multicultural, multilingual health literacy intervention to promote knowledge about the HPV vaccine and foster informed HPV immunization decisions among parents of preadolescent girls and among adolescent girls at high risk for HPV infection. The populations of interest in this study are Koreans, Vietnamese, Filipinos, African Americans and Latinos. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) identify HPV vaccine literacy levels, attitudes, perceptions and information sources among diverse at-risk populations, (2) identify specific themes, message elements and communication strategies for an intervention that enhances patient comprehension and evaluation of the risks and benefits of the vaccine, (3) identify cultural values, beliefs, and practices that influence attention, comprehension, and appraisal of HPV vaccine information intended to inform an immunization decision, (4) design and produce a multicultural, multilingual education intervention that delivers cognitively accessible, culturally competent, health literacy information about HPV vaccination tailored to diverse populations at high risk for HPV infection, and (5) evaluate the efficacy of an interactive multicultural, multilingual learning and decision tol using next-generation digital videodisc technology to increase patients' knowledge about the HPV vaccine, assess the risks and benefits attendant to HPV vaccination, and promote informed vaccination decisions among the diverse racial/ethnic groups in this study. This study responds to the HHS Initiative to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, which cals atention to the gaps in access to preventive health resources, principally among racial and ethnic minorities. This study will conduct focus groups and cognitive interviews to guide development of culturally competent, age-appropriate materials tailored to 16 diverse audiences in four different languages (English, Spanish, Korean and Vietnamese) on a single Blu-ray disc. It will conduct cross-cultural validation of decision-making scales for use with our five study populations. It will also conduct a randomized, controlled efficacy evaluation of the health literacy intervention among the five study populations. The study enlists the collaboration of established, well-regarded community-based organizations from each of the racial/ethnic communities to guide the study and provide access to prospective study participants in their respective communities. It also leverages our extensive experience with complex, multicultural, multilingual studies to effectively manage the challenges of this multi-audience health literacy study.      PUBLIC HEALTH

"Team Activation To Increase HPV Vaccination Rates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Certain segments of the population have increased cancer incidence and mortality rates because they have not benefited equally from the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, cancer screening, and the follow-up of abnormal tests. Examples of groups still experiencing increased cancer rates are African Americans and low socioeconomic populations. In addition, these populations have increased HPV prevalence rates. Since HPV is a problem in these groups, ways to address increased HPV rates are needed.  A health disparities research team at The Ohio State University in partnership with the Columbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc. (CNHC), a federally qualified health center, proposes to develop an educational program, STOP (Share, Train, Organize, to Prevent) HPV, aimed at reducing HPV-associated diseases by improving HPV vaccination rates among female and male adolescents (age 9-18). The goal of this proposal is to develop, refine, and test the feasibility of a culturally appropriate multi-level educational program intended for parents (level 1) of adolescents who seek care at a CNHC, the healthcare team (physicians, nurses, assistants, and staff) (level 2) at the CNHC, and the health center (level 3) to increase HPV vaccination rates among adolescents. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) Develop a multi-level HPV vaccine educational intervention directed at parents, providers/staff, and the health center that includes: (a) sharing information about HPV, HPV-associated cancers and diseases, and the HPV vaccine; (b) communication skills training to improve parent-provider conversations about the HPV vaccine; and (c) organizational level components to increase vaccination rates; and (2) Test the feasibility of the multi-level HPV vaccine educational intervention among 10 parents of adolescent females and 10 parents of adolescent males, providers/staff, and one health center. Specific aims will be carried out in partnership with parents, healthcare providers and staff from two CNHCs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are health disparities associated with cancer in the United States partially due to increased human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence rates among certain population groups. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a multi-level HPV vacccine educational program and test the feasibility of the program among parents of children (age 9-18) from mainly an underserved population seeking medical care at a federally qualified health center. The proposed project uses a health disparities research team in partnership with a neighborhood health center to develop and test the feasibility of a HPV vaccine educational program.

"Implementation Evaluation of a Cervical Cancer Screening Initiative in Cusco, Per     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer continues to be the second most common cancer among women worldwide. In Peru, rough estimates place screening coverage between 7-43% of the eligible population. Effective community-based interventions are needed to address screening coverage in the Andean region of Peru, but the development of such interventions are limited by gaps in our understanding of: (1) cultural beliefs toward cervical cancer and HPV; and (2) effective intervention programs targeting specific priority populations, such as indigenous Quechua women. This project is significant because it will positively impact gynecological health among Quechua women through the implementation of a well-executed, participatory, implementation evaluation and social marketing intervention pilot study to maximize screening opportunities. The overall goal of this application is to conduct Rapid Assessment, Response, and Evaluation (RARE) - a rapid ethnographic assessment approach - to evaluate a large cervical cancer screening initiative and use the formative findings to design and pilot a brief social marketing intervention. The social marketing intervention will be aimed to increase screening uptake during the third year of the 3-year screening initiative. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that interventions using a social marketing strategy will be effective for increasing cervical cancer screening in Quechua populations when such screening opportunities are both convenient and low cost. The two specific aims are to: (1) evaluate the social, behavioral and cultural factors that impact cervical cancer screening uptake among Quechua women from the Cusco, Peru region using RARE; and (2) develop and pilot a social marketing intervention to increase cervical cancer screening uptake and appropriate follow-up care targeted to Quechua women in the Cusco, Peru region. The proposed project is innovative because it will use RARE to conduct an implementation evaluation of the screening initiative and inform the design and piloting of a brief social marketing intervention. The contribution of the proposed research is expected to be the development of a promotional strategy which will consist of photonovella booklets and radio advertisements, and be supplemented by 'word of mouth' communications using social network analysis.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A better understanding of knowledge, risk perceptions, and cultural attitudes among indigenous Quechua women toward cervical cancer screening will assist in developing more effective social marketing efforts and impacting cervical cancer disparities in groups suffering the greatest burden of the disease, thereby improving public health. The proposed study will develop and pilot a culturally appropriate social marketing intervention based on systematic ethnographic research to increase cervical cancer screening among Quechua women in the Cusco region of Peru in partnership with a large, three-year cervical cancer screening initiative program.              A better understanding of knowledge, risk perceptions, and cultural attitudes among indigenous Quechua women toward cervical cancer screening will assist in developing more effective social marketing efforts and impacting cervical cancer disparities in groups suffering the greatest burden of the disease, thereby improving public health.

"Mother-Daughter Joint Decision Making to Obtain the HPV Vaccine     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a precursor of cervical cancer and genital warts. HPV strains, 16 and 18, are recognized as precursors of 70% of cervical cancers. HPV strains, 6 and 11, are associated with 90% of genital warts. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed a vaccine to protect against these four HPV types. Recent estimates indicate that only 18% of teenage girls have received the three-dose series in the U.S. Cervical cancer affects ethnic minorities disproportionately. Cervical cancer incidence is two to fourfold in Latina women when compared to non-Latina white women. Research also suggests that the prevalence of HPV is greater in ethnic minority women.  Our inquiry will be guided by a combination of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model of preventive behavior (Fisher & Fisher, 1992; Fisher, Fisher, & Shuper, 2009) and cultural factors. Our proposed investigation will consist of three studies conducted in sequence: two qualitative and one quantitative. Qualitative study 1 will consist of semi-structured interview conducted separately with 30 mothers and 30 non-vaccinated daughters. The purpose of qualitative study 1 will be to identify: a) format and communication source to provide information, in a future intervention, to mothers and daughters about HPV and the vaccine while considering health literacy and numeracy, b) deterrents and motivators of vaccination acceptance while considering cultural factors, and c) the skills and resources that mothers and daughters perceive they need to be self-efficacious in communicating effectively with one another regarding sexuality and the adoption of sexuality-related health preventive measures such as vaccination. The objective of qualitative study 2 will be to corroborate and expand our findings from qualitative study 1. Qualitative study 2 will consist of semi-structured interviews conducted separately with 30 mothers and 30 vaccinated daughters. The purpose of qualitative study 2 will be to elucidate: a) knowledge about HPV etiology and vaccination, b) how the decision to vaccinate was made, and c) mother and daughter level of comfort in discussing sexuality- related preventive behaviors. Lastly, the purpose of the quantitative study will be to establish that the domains pertaining to the decision to vaccinate- information, motivation, behavioral skills-predict vaccination decisions in a sample of 150 Latina mothers (50% who have vaccinated their daughters).  The findings from the proposed study will be used to pursue an R01 to develop and pilot test a future intervention to promote adoption of the HPV vaccine in the Latino community. The accomplishment of our aims will inform the development of an intervention based on well-defined underlying decision-making mechanisms critical to the adoption of a disease preventive behavior that has the potential to considerably reduce ethnic health disparities in cancer. In addition, information gathered in our studies can be translated to promote uptake of the HPV vaccine by health care practitioners impacting directly the field of nursing science.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The findings from this research will be used to inform the development of an intervention to promote vaccination in the Latino community. In addition, the findings will inform health care practitioners of the information that can be provided to Latinas, n the patient-provider encounter, to motivate vaccination.              The findings from this research will be used to inform the development of an intervention to promote vaccination in the Latino community.

Building on these findings and existing community partnerships we will conduct cancer outreach tailored to the unique needs of each community. Our major research project is a randomized study among 600 women in our three communities who have not been adequately screened for cervical cancer. At each site, one third of the women would be exposed to standard NCI approved outreach interventions and a second group will receive a comprehensive home based CHW intervention encouraging women to have Pap Smear testing at one of the three FQHCs. While CHWs are a promising approach, many women exposed to this intervention remain unscreened. Thus we propose a third approach in which women at each site receive the CHW intervention but also have the option of screening through HPV testing done via home based self-sampling. Our experience in Little Haiti is that by coupling this innovative molecular technology with a CHW led culturally tailored approach nearly all women agree to be screened. The SUCCESS pilot project will be led by one of our minority junior faculty. Through a pre-post test design, she will examine the impact of a CHW led educational curriculum that has been specifically tailored women who are HIV positive. Lastly, our training core will develop formal seminars in health disparities research and CBPR for twelve clinical fellows and post-doctoral trainees and provide a more intensive longitudinal practicum and mentorship on community-based participatory research to four early stage investigators including a preparing a CBPR grant proposal.          The vision of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities.(SUCCESS) is that through increased cervical cancer screening we could eliminate cervical cancer health disparities in our local community.

"Cervical, Anal & Oral HPV Persistence/Adolescent Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescents and young women have the highest rates of cervical HPV, including infection with the HPV types causing significant morbidity and mortality. Introduction of the FDA-approved quadrivalent vaccine GARDASIL (Merck & Co., NJ) targeting HPV16 and HPV18 (high-risk types present in >65% of cervical cancers), as well as HPV6 and 11 (associated with most genital warts), has the potential to reduce the burden of genital HPV and disease. However, HPV vaccine clinical trials focused exclusively on low-risk women with limited numbers of sexual partners, who were highly compliant with the vaccine schedule; these females were not representative of those most at risk to suffer from HPV-related disease. In fact, Hispanic and African-American women have the highest and second highest incidence rates of cervical cancer in the U.S., respectively, and high mortality rates from cervical cancer. In addition, the association of HPV-related anal and oropharyngeal lesions is an important public health concern, yet few if any vaccine studies in women evaluated anal and/or oral HPV. Subsequent to the approval and release of GARDASIL, we initiated a prospective cohort study of sexually-active inner-city, predominantly Hispanic and African-American adolescent women attending the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center (MSAHC), the largest comprehensive adolescent primary care facility in the U.S. To date, this project has enrolled more than 640 sexually active teens. Prevalent HPV infection at enrollment was detected in 54% of cervical, 41% of anal, and 21% of oral specimens, with vaccine types (HPV 6/11, 16 & 18) present in 7%, 7% and 1% of adolescents, respectively. The cross-sectional baseline detection of vaccine HPV types in the cervix was inversely associated with the number of vaccinations. However, there was considerable incident (new) detection of cervical HPV 16/18 infection in the cervix not present at enrollment despite vaccination (HPV16/18 incidence=4.2 per 100 person years); a rate substantially above that reported in the efficacy trials. We propose to address the health disparities of HPV in minority young women and continue our cohort study of high-risk adolescent women participating in an HPV immunization program at MSAHC. We propose to extend the prospective follow-up (with repeated visits every 6 months) to evaluate longer term burden of infection, and increase the sample size to just over 1,400 subjects to improve statistical power. This will allow us to determine risk factors for break-through HPV infections, and integrate a new aim to evaluate psychosocial elements of adolescent development and risk behaviors in high-risk teens. The data obtained from this study will be essential to understanding the real-world impact of HPV vaccination in this group not studied in the large vaccine trials and will provide the biological underpinnings for future HPV and cervical cancer screening practices, as well as estimating the potential impact of vaccine on anal and oropharyngeal HPV infections. Adolescents and young women have the highest rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, including infection with the HPV types causing high-grade neoplasia, cervical and anal cancer. This study will investigate the continued burden of HPV in a population of high-risk, predominantly Hispanic and African-American inner- city adolescent women not included in the large randomized clinical trials of the HPV vaccine. This study will provide information that is critical to the proper design of screening and preventative strategies in populations that are at the highest risk for HPV-associated diseases despite vaccination.","Cervical, Anal & Oral HPV Persistence/Adolescent Girls",8496641,R56AI072204,"['Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Behavior ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Antibodies ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Age ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Female ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Venereal Warts ', ' Genital Warts ', ' Condylomata Acuminata ', ' Condyloma Accuminata ', ' Anogenital venereal warts ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Adapting patient navigation to promote cancer screening in Chicagos Chinatown    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the presence of five major academic medical centers, a large county hospital, and two NCI designated comprehensive cancer centers, Chicago has some of the worst cancer disparities between income groups in the US. This burden is accentuated with respect to linguistically and culturally isolated immigrants who do not traditionally benefit from nor participate in research. In particular, Chinese women in Chicago, a significantly understudied population, have unacceptably low breast and cervical cancer screening rates which are only half the rates of white women.  This application is a direct outgrowth of concerns expressed by leaders of Chicago's Chinatown community about the need to educate and empower low income Chinese women about cancer prevention and control. Patient navigators (PN) have been studied in African American, Latino, and white populations. However, PN research has largely focused on follow-up of patients with cancer or abnormal findings, rarely to improve screening rates. We seek to study the dissemination of PN behavioral health services interventions by implementing a tailored PN intervention with a focus on increasing breast and cervical cancer screening as well as follow-up for the largely immigrant population of low income women in Chinatown. Our proposed research builds on two NIH funded PN studies, our Chinatown RC4 research infrastructure grant activities, including a community data resource center, and our long-standing community based participatory research (CBPR) partnership with Chinatown's major safety net provider, Mercy Medical Center.  Using mixed methods within a CBPR approach, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of PN adaptation and extension to cancer control education and screening under the auspices of our community research partner, the Chinese American Service League. We will study the fundamental mechanisms required to optimally adapt interventions focused on immigrant populations that are culturally and linguistically isolated. The proposed project seeks to expand the role of PNs, to learn more about what determines the effectiveness of PNs as health educators, how to encourage breast and cervical cancer screening, and how PNs can become trusted and respected community health workers and advocates that provide essential links between the community and the health care system for low income women in Chicago's Chinatown.  This research will assess how Chinese women interact with health information and resources via a PN team to make health decisions and access the health care system. Women comprise the largest segment of health workers, health consumers, and health decision makers for their families and communities, but are underrepresented accessing appropriate health services among Asian immigrant populations. Once women are empowered, informed health consumers, they become catalysts for social change.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed project aims to adapt the rapidly growing phenomenon of patient navigation into a broader effort to use community health workers for culturally competent cancer control and prevention. Our CBPR approach, grounded in the long-standing prestige of our community organization and safety net provider partners, offers the opportunity to close the loop between community-defined health problems and access to the local health care system. Because many women in Illinois already have public insurance coverage for cancer screening and follow-up but do not take advantage of this resource, this proposal has major relevance for future efforts to increase access for vulnerable populations once broader health reform laws are implemented.           This proposed project aims to adapt the rapidly growing phenomenon of patient navigation into a broader effort to use community health workers for culturally competent cancer control and prevention.

"Better Breast and Cervical Cancer Control for Korean American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite considerable progress made in U.S. cancer control during the past 20 years, certain ethnic minority groups continue to experience significant health disparities. Breast and cervical cancer screening rates for Korean American (KA) women are far below the national goal, and below rates reported for other ethnic groups. As a result, KA women are often diagnosed at a later stage of cancer which can lead to a poor prognosis, high mortality, and subsequent emotional and financial burdens. Limited health literacy is emerging as a far-reaching, major barrier to cancer prevention behaviors, particularly among non-English speaking immigrant populations. This research application is formulated to answer research questions that address critical knowledge gaps in cancer control intervention research for linguistically and/or socially isolated ethnic minority communities using the KA community as an example. These questions are: (1) whether a health literacy-focused intervention using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) process will be effective in promoting health literacy and increasing breast and cervical cancer screening rates among KA women; and (2) whether a tailored intervention delivered by community health workers (CHWs) will be effective in such a community. The proposed study is a community-based, cluster-randomized clinical trial with two parallel arms, with a delayed intervention. A longitudinal repeated measures design will allow us to determine the effectiveness of the proposed health literacy-focused tailored cancer control intervention delivered by CHWs. A total of 480 KA women will participate in the study. The primary outcome of this study will be adherence to breast and cervical cancer screening. We hypothesize that, as compared to KA women in the control (delayed intervention) group, KA women who receive our literacy-focused tailored CHW intervention will demonstrate higher levels of adherence to screening for breast and cervical cancer. Through implementation of these research activities, we expect to establish a mechanism for disseminating critical health information for this population and to enhance a community network which will facilitate community access to breast and cervical cancer screening. While the focus of this research project is health literacy promotion and breast and cervical cancer screening among KA women, the core principles and methodology of this intervention can provide insights toward development of effective, culturally sensitive health literacy programs to meet the needs of socially and/or linguistically isolated minority groups with inadequate cancer control throughout the United States. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE: Korean American (KA) women have the second highest incidence of cervical cancer nationally and are experiencing rapid increases in breast cancer incidence. Limited capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions (i.e., limited health literacy) is a major barrier to early detection of cancer among KA women. This study proposes to test if a health literacy-focused intervention using a community- based participatory research process will be effective in promoting health literacy and increasing breast and cervical cancer screening rates among KA women; and (2) whether a tailored intervention delivered by trained community health workers will be effective in such a community.

"REACH UP & OUT: Eliminating Breast and Cervical Cancer Disparities It has been well documented that disparities exist between African American and white women with regard to morbidity and mortality associated with breast and cervical cancer. We have established a very active coalition, conducted comprehensive needs assessments, and developed and pilot-tested a community action plan to reduce breast and cervical cancer screening disparities between white and African American women in Alabama's Black Belt. Although effective and well received by the community, this intervention did not lead to behavior change among all women within the targeted population. The overall purpose of the proposed intervention is to further reduce breast and cervical cancer disparities between white and African American women in the Black Belt of Alabama by increasing Pap smear and mammography rates. We propose to develop and implement a multi-component intervention that uses media, education, and enhanced access, incorporating sociological and cognitive behavioral approaches in the development and implementation of the messages. This intervention is an extension of our pilot work utilizing community health advisors (CHAs) (sociologic approach). Although the pilot intervention showed significant increase in breast and cervical cancer screening among African American women in the Black Belt, there is still a hard to-reach group, which, despite our efforts, has not engaged in breast and cervical cancer screening. Based on the results of follow-up interviews with this group of women and discussions with our coalition members and CHAs, we propose the development, implementation, and evaluation of an enhanced intervention, which incorporates cognitive behavioral approaches that will challenge the barriers (e.g., fear of finding out they have cancer, the belief that screening will not make any difference) and reinforce the motivators (e.g., support from other women) to engage this group in breast and cervical cancer screening. Although the Community-Based Participatory Research and the Empowerment Model will be the overall conceptual framework used in this study, the PEN-3 and the Health Belief Model will guide intervention development and implementation. The intervention counties will receive education and cognitive/behavioral skills training delivered by CHAs, while the control counties will continue to receive our current intervention that has proven to be successful. The study will be carried out in two phases. In Phase I, we will refine the enhanced intervention and assessment tools through formative assessment. In Phase II, we will randomly assign the counties to intervention/control groups, implement, and evaluate the intervention.

"Feasibility of Virtual Agent Cervical Cancer Education for Hispanic Farmworkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinas experience higher cervical cancer (CC) incidence and mortality when compared to the general population in the United States. Many Latinas lack access to health care and experience literacy, communication, and knowledge barriers that prevent them from obtaining CC screening. Patient navigator (PN) and other similar interventions have been implemented to increase CC screening rates; however, few have focused directly on the needs of Latinas. Interactive technological interventions, like embodied conversational agents (ECA), are currently used in other populations, settings, and for other health topics, but no known initiative has used culturally and literacy appropriate technology to deliver Spanish-language CC education as part of a PN intervention. This study aims to create and conduct a preliminary evaluation of a Spanish-language Virtual Patient Educator (VPE) multimedia application to augment a PN intervention for increasing CC screening rates among Latinas in a rural agricultural community. Using the Social Cognitive Theory, the proposed project will be conducted in 2 phases. In Phase 1, the research team will engage community members to develop a low literacy Spanish-language interactive multimedia application consisting of an ECA. Using theoretical principles and drawing from our formative research, the project team will design the VPE through systematic and technical processes. Ongoing feedback (usability testing) from members of the intended audience will be carried out to ensure that patients (users) can perform intended system tasks efficiently, effectively, and satisfactoril. Once usability testing is complete, a series of learner verification interviews will be conducted t assess initial suitability of the VPE. Since the VPE will be the first known Spanish-language ECA used to augment a PN intervention, it is important to see whether patients accept the VPE and whether it is feasible to conduct a study of patient navigation augmented by the VPE. In Phase 2, a preliminary evaluation of 2 methods of patient navigation delivery (with and without VPE) will be conducted with 60 participants who are not up to date with recommended CC screening according to American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians' guidelines. Cluster randomization will be used to randomize patients to 1 of 2 PN intervention conditions: (1) PN; or (2) PN plus VPE (PN+VPE) using date of clinic as unit of randomization. The preliminary evaluation will examine the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, data collection, and acceptability of VPE application. Exploratory data will also be collected regarding the potential impact of PN+VPE on behavioral capacity and self-efficacy for obtaining CC screening, Pap test adherence, and satisfaction with care. The proposed project will advance our research towards the development of interactive technology interventions to disseminate health education to disparate populations.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latinas experience higher cervical cancer incidence and mortality when compared to the general population in the United States. The proposed study is the first to develop interactive technology to augment a patient navigation intervention by providing patient education about human papillomavirus, cervical cancer, and the importance of regular cervical cancer screening.

"Disparities in cervical cancer precursors and deregulation of imprinted genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although screening for uterine cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN) and its aggressive treatment has resulted in decreased cervical cancer incidence and mortality, an estimated 11,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) and 40,000 cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS) continue to be diagnosed every year in the United States. ICC incidence is 60% higher and mortality over two times higher in African Americans compared to whites. Such disparate rates in incidence and mortality are despite comparable screening rates to detect precursor lesions, comparable prevalence of 'high risk' human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the etiologic agent, and co-factors such as cigarette smoking. Reasons for such disparities are largely unknown. A more detailed understanding of the etiology of lesions that progress will improve risk stratification to distinguish women with a low risk of progression from those likely to rapidly progress to invasive cancer. We posit that deregulation of genomically imprinted genes, a group of approximately 50 known growth-regulatory genes where only one allele is normally active, may predict progression to cervical cancer. We found that a substantial group of imprinted genes exhibit altered expression in ICC versus normal cervical epithelium. In addition, methylation analysis of two regulatory regions controlling IGF2 expression shows deviation from normal in specimens with CIN2-CIN3 classification and more profound deviation in invasive cancers. Together, these findings suggest that imprinted genes are deregulated in ICC and these features may improve detection of CIN cases likely to progress. Our central hypothesis is that deregulation at imprint regulatory elements of imprinted genes, likely influenced by environmental exposures, increases risk of progression to cervical cancer in women infected with 'high risk' HPV. We have already shown racial variation on the effect of environmental exposures on imprint deregulation, and thus, further hypothesize that higher risk in African Americans and Hispanics is due to race/ethnic differences in deregulation of these genes. Our specific aims are to: (1) determine if deregulation of imprint regulatory elements of known imprinted genes is associated with increased risk of progression of CIN1 to CIN2+, and whether this association varies by race/ethnicity; (2) determine whether aberrant methylation of imprint regulatory elements in cervical cells is similar to that found in peripheral blood cells, suggesting an early event; and associated with (i) transcriptional expression, and (ii) loss of imprinting; (3) evaluate whether deregulation of known imprinted genes in cervical cells can be used to discriminate women with CIN2+ among 500 Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance (ASCUS) cases. To address the Aims, we will recruit and follow 1,500 women with CIN1 and 500 with ASCUS, and examine the association between aberrant methylation markers at imprinted regulatory elements of 12 genes and progression from CIN1 to CIN2+. We will then test the performance of these markers to identify CIN2+ cases from among 500 ASCUS cases. Data from the proposed study will improve triage decisions and reduce disparities in ICC morbidity and mortality.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although screening for cervical intraepithelial lesions to prevent cervical cancer has resulted in decreased cancer incidence and mortality, an estimated 11,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer and 40,000 carcinomas in situ cases continue to be diagnosed every year in the United States with incidence 60% higher and mortality >2-times higher in African Americans compared to whites. We will recruit and follow 1,500 CIN1 and 500 cases of Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance (ASCUS), and examine the association between aberrant methylation at imprinted regulatory elements of 12 genes and progression to CIN2 or worse and then test the performance of these markers in ASCUS cases, independent of known co-factors.

"Comparative and Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing HPV-Related Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, more than 25,000 cases of invasive cancer attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection occur in the United States; nearly 50% are cervical cancer, while the rest involve the oral cavity/oropharynx, anus, vulva, penis, and vagina. Collectively, these account for substantial morbidity and mortality, contribute to health disparities, and are associated with high economic costs. Advancements in HPV-related cancer epidemiology, coupled with new (e.g., HPV-16,-18 vaccines, HPV DNA testing) and emerging (e.g., biomarkers, therapeutic vaccines) technologies provide a remarkable opportunity to improve cancer prevention efforts. However, critical challenges remain with respect to clinical decision-making and prevention policy, pertaining to knowledge gaps and heterogeneities in the natural history of different cancers, uncertainties in HPV type distribution following HPV-16,-18 vaccination, and the real-world clinical effectiveness of emerging technologies. We propose to employ a decision-analytic approach, developing a flexible modeling framework that will allow us to synthesize the best available data; evaluate the health and economic consequences of alternative strategies; explore the uncertainty around their outcomes; explicitly quantify the tradeoffs associated with different approaches; and inform timely clinical and policy questions. By achieving our aims, we expect to have an impact on (1) the analytic methods of decision science; (2) the equitable distribution and rationale use of new technology; (3) the effectiveness of strategies for cancer prevention through clinical guidelines and national policies; (4) HPV-related cancer outcomes, including reduced incidence, enhanced quality of life, improved survival, and reduced disparities; and (5) the financial and economic profile of delivering cancer-related health services.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid advances in the fields of HPV-related cancer epidemiology and medical technology present opportunities to revolutionize the approach to cancer prevention in the U.S. but have outpaced the ability of policy makers to make informed decisions regarding optimal adoption of health interventions.

"Etiology of cervical cancer health disparity in American Indian women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in women worldwide. American Indian (AI) women living on the Northern Plains have a greater incidence of cervical cancer and suffer from a higher mortality rate. Our recent studies have shown that AI women have more than twice the incidence of HPV infection and that HPV positive AI women have a two times higher likelihood of having abnormal PAP tests than HPV positive Caucasian women; suggesting underlying causes which increase HPV pathology. One potential cofactor may be smoke exposure and its effects on the host immune response and HPV oncogenesis. Our data indicate that 4 times more AI women smoke as compared to Caucasian women and the majority of HPV positive AI women smoke. While smoking is a recognized risk factor for cervical cancer, the molecular interactions between HPV and smoke compounds are unknown. Our laboratory has recently shown that smoke carcinogen Benzo[a]Pyrene (BaP) increases the expression of HPV oncoproteins, suggesting a direct molecular link between HPV infection and exposure to smoke. We have also identified that curcumin, a natural anti-cancer compound, effectively inhibits the expression of HPV oncoproteins. Based on this compelling evidence, we hypothesize that exposure to tobacco smoke synergizes with HPV infection and increases the incidence and severity of cervical cancer in American Indian women by increasing the expression of HPV oncoproteins (E6/E7) and modulating cellular/humoral immune responses. Additionally, we hypothesize that curcumin or nanocurcumin may be effective methods for the repression of HPV infection in AI women. We propose to 1) investigate novel mechanisms of synergy between HPV infection, BaP and the development of cervical cancer, 2) evaluate the efficacy of curcumin/nanocurcumin to suppress HPV oncogene expression in preclinical and clinical settings, and 3) to investigate the effect of smoke exposure on cervical immune responses. The results of this study will provide information regarding underlying etiological factors that are responsible for cervical cancer health disparity in AI women and will ultimately reduce the burden of cervical cancer.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative American Indian (AI) women living in the Northern Plains have a greater incidence of cervical cancer and suffer from a higher mortality rate.

"Promoting cancer screening for mothers using a daughter-initiated approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dr. Mosavel's career goal is to establish herself as an independent investigator in cancer control and behavioral research with a focus on African-Americans in low-income neighborhoods. The goal of this application is to integrate a strong mentoring, training, and focused research agenda to enable her to: 1) become an independent health disparities researcher who conducts large scale, community-based behavioral cancer interventions and 2) develop and strengthen her mixed methods skill set to effectively evaluate cancer interventions. The research plan examines the feasibility of the mother and adolescent daughter dyad, particularly from low-income, African-American households, as a unique portal within which to communicate critical cancer prevention and control information. The prevailing health promotion paradigm is that parents give their children advice about health. Consequently, there has been minimal focus on the influence that adolescents can have on their parents' health behaviors. The present study will focus on assessing the daughters' ability to influence their mothers' cancer screening behaviors. There are three specific aims. The first aim is to explore and identify the necessary conditions for effective giving and receiving of breast and cervical cancer information within the mother-daughter dyad. The second aim is to   design the delivery and evaluate the comprehension, credibility and emotional response associated with the daughter-initiated cancer message. Finally, the third aim is to conduct a study of a daughter-focused intervention to examine its effect on mothers' breast and cervical cancer screening behaviors. This study has the potential to utilize the assets of the mother-daughter dyad and promote cancer dialogue in the family. Consequently, a daughter-initiated intervention may have a significant impact on mothers' health behavior. Mothers who receive guided support and encouragement from their daughters may be more responsive to cancer screening messages and more likely to obtain a Pap smear and mammogram when compared to mothers who do not. Likewise, adolescent daughters who are provided with opportunities to discuss cancer prevention may, in turn, grow more knowledgeable and intent on eventually obtaining a Pap smear and mammogram.

"Optimizing HPV Vaccination: Parents, Providers and Pre-teen Boys     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) are FDA-licensed for both males and females ages 9-26 years old and are most effective when given before sexual exposure to the virus. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the US and infects approximately 50% of sexually active males and females. HPV causes genital warts and is associated with cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and throat cancers. Minority racial and ethnic populations are disproportionately at higher risk for STIs and HPV-related cancers than are White. The first of two HPV vaccines for females was licensed in 2006 to protect against cervical cancer and genital warts. HPV vaccine for males was licensed in 2009 to protect against genital warts and in 2010 against anal cancer. CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends routine HPV vaccination for females and a less directive permissive (allowed but not in routine schedule) vaccination for males. This project uses dissemination strategies to stimulate communication about HPV vaccine among parents, healthcare providers and pre-teen boys at a critical time when the vaccine is new to both parents and clinical practice. Dissemination strategies are based on the Health Belief Model and message design theories. The intervention in a 13 county region in North Carolina includes (1) a social marketing campaign for parents with radio announcements, posters and brochures, and (2) collaboration with healthcare providers of pre-teen boys using posters and brochures to stimulate parent awareness of HPV vaccine for males. The overall objective is to assess the extent to which parents and providers respond to dissemination strategies by deciding on HPV vaccine for pre-teen boys. The long term goal is to promote male sexual health through early intervention and prevention of HPV related disease. The central hypothesis is that parents and providers are relevant decision makers who can be motivated to ensure pre-teen boys' future sexual health. The aims are to (1) Evaluate a set of dissemination strategies that promote HPV vaccine in pre-teen boys, especially among racial and ethnic populations at greater risk of disease; (2) Assess whether a theory-based social marketing campaign affects parents' motivations to vaccinate preteen sons against HPV; (3) Assess whether a theory-based social marketing campaign affects providers' motivations to vaccinate preteen male patients against HPV. Pre and post intervention cross-sectional, independent sample telephone surveys, each with 325 parents of 9-13 year old boys, will assess parents' response to the campaign. Pre and post intervention surveys of a sample of 350 healthcare providers will assess practices on HPV vaccine recommendation. NC Immunization Registry data will be analyzed to compare HPV vaccination rates in intervention counties with a control group of 19 similar counties and all 87 non-intervention counties. We anticipate the research will yield effective dissemination strategies that can be broadly used to reduce HPV infection in males, especially racial and ethnic populations.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will disseminate gender-based research to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in HPV-related disease through HPV vaccination of males in early adolescence. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because it will have a positive effect on dissemination and implementation of HPV vaccine for males by optimizing communication among parents, healthcare providers and pre-teen boys.                    The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will disseminate gender-based research to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in HPV-related disease through HPV vaccination of males in early adolescence.

"A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among Pacific Islander Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among PI Women ABSTRACT Despite the fact that cervical cancer is one of the most preventable of cancers, it remains one of the top five causes of cancer deaths in the U.S. and in California. The Pap test has been shown to be effective in not only detecting cancer but also precancerous cells. Even with the introduction of HPV testing and vaccines, Pap tests represent an important cervical cancer prevention and early detection method for women in this country. Unfortunately, the Pap test is severely underutilized among many ethnic and racial populations, including Pacific Islanders (PIs) who have high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality data among specific PI ethnic groups is sparse, with available information underscoring significant cancer health disparities. In California as in the Pacific, cervical cancer is one of the top five causes of cancer deaths. Given the dearth of PI researchers and studies at the NIH level, community-based participatory research (CBPR) holds the potential for engaging community cultural experts alongside cancer health disparities researchers to address their pressing cervical cancer detection needs. This five year cluster unit randomized trial will develop and evaluate a social support intervention targeting both men and women to increase Pap testing decision making and behavior among Chamorro, Samoan and Tongan women age 18-65 years old in Southern California. We aim to: 1. Apply CBPR principles and processes for community/university partners throughout the grant period; 2. Develop and pretest two gender-specific and culturally tailored educational interventions for PI women and men. The interventions will be conducted separately by gender, and will employ a video, flipchart, and brochure, along with small-group discussions facilitated by gender-matched community health educators; 3. Develop and validate instruments measuring men's social support (provided), women's social support (perceived) and women's decision making utility; 4. Recruit and randomly assign community-based organizational samples and recruit and follow the cohorts of PI females and males in the intervention and control groups 5. Examine the associations that test the conceptual model regarding social support, decision making utility, and Pap testing intentions and behaviors; 6. Follow the cohort of PI women and men in the intervention vs. control groups to assess the impact of the intervention. Using a longitudinal cohort design, we will identify, recruit, and randomly assign PI members of churches and other community-based organizations to one of two intervention options: a) a culturally tailored social support intervention group for women and men consisting of community health educator-facilitated video, flipchart and brochure; or b) a usual care control group, consisting of pre-existing cancer education materials (brochures) for PI women and men delivered by community health educators. We posit that the planned social support intervention will increase men's provision, and women's perceptions, of Pap testing social support, leading to increases in women's prioritization of Pap testing decision making utility and Pap testing behaviors. The proposed study team involves long-standing university and community collaborators, and uses a multiple PI model to institutionalize shared participation and leadership structures. The community side of this CBPR study includes three CBOs with years of experience in health promotion, disease prevention, and collaborative research for their respective PI populations. The university side includes experienced behavioral scientists in CBPR, cancer control and decision making with multiethnic populations. This study will add to the existing science of cancer health disparities by adapting and applying well-established behavioral theories to understand the ways in which collectivist-oriented interventions influence individual women's cancer screening behavioral changes. Furthermore, this study will illuminate the CBPR engagement aspects necessary to conduct rigorous intervention research in small-size populations. The product of this study will be a culturally-tailored intervention that holds the potential to become a model for other collectivistic populations. Strengths of this study include: i) a focus on a major cancer health disparity; ii) development and testing of methods that are applicable to other health disparities; iii) a theoretical focus on decision making (a priority area for NCI regarding translational research); iv) an intervention approach that investigates and develops new strategies to improve cultural tailoring and evaluation; v) a focus on men; and vi) an ethnically diverse team of community and university investigators with an established track record in CBPR research.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among Pacific Islander Women Project Narrative Pacific Islanders (PIs) experience some of the highest cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in the U.S., yet little research exists on the ways to address and ameliorate their cancer health disparities.

"Understanding the Cervical Cancer Health Gap for Women in Jail    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women in the criminal justice system are four-five times as likely to have cervical cancer compared to non- incarcerated women. Some have attributed this disparity to difficulty in follow-up of abnormal Paps, but little is known empirically about why women involved in the criminal justice system have low abnormal Pap follow-up rates. The objective of this application is two-fold: to understand the interpretation of abnormal Pap events and their subsequent follow-up from the perspective of incarcerated women; second, to interpret women's abnormal Pap events and follow-ups based on a review of their medical records. The validation of women's accounts of abnormal Pap follow-up (or lack thereof) with medical chart review will provide an understanding as to why some women do not gain access to follow-up care. Thus, we will be able target interventions to address this documented gap in women's understanding of abnormal Pap events versus actual events. To meet this objective, first we will conduct focus groups and in-depth interviews with 40 women in a Kansas City county jail about abnormal Pap screening and subsequent follow-up events. Studying women's experiences with abnormal Paps and follow-up may provide clues as to their cervical cancer screening knowledge and the processes by which women actually seek out cervical cancer prevention services given their movement in and out of jails. Second, we will ask the 40 women previously interviewed for permission to access their medical records, in order to investigate whether incarcerated women's self-report of abnormal Pap and follow-up events matched actual medical records of these events. This aim will allow us to gauge women's understanding of Pap events, validate the medical barriers that women faced in trying to gain access to follow- up care, and demonstrate the feasibility of assessing health care access through medical chart review for this high-risk population. This project has significance for public health impact by providing insight into how to address the cervical cancer burden for women involved in the criminal justice system. This project is innovative in its goal of assessing incarcerated women's understanding of abnormal Pap events and validating their understanding with medical record review. Study findings will contribute to the development of an intervention that attempts to close the cervical cancer health gap between women involved in the criminal justice system and their sisters in the ""free"" world.          The public health impact of this study is that it will inform interventions that reduce cervical health morbidity and mortality for an already disadvantaged group, women involved in the criminal justice system. This study will tell us not only about the chasm between women's understanding of Pap events and actual medical encounters, but will also speak more generally to this population's experience with health care access, given their movement in and out of the criminal justice system.

"South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION: South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities. The objective of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities (SUCCESS) is to establish a regional center addressing the unequal burden of cervical cancer in Miami Dade-County. SUCCESS will build on Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) relationships which we have established with Haitians in the city of Miami and Hispanics in the city of Hialeah. We will also partner with a 3rd multi ethnic less urban community located in the southern unincorporated Miami-Dade. Recognizing this as a very medically underserved area, our community partners selected this as our 3rd site. Our multiple PI leadership  team includes two investigators from the University of Miami's (UM) Departments of Medicine and   Epidemiology, both members of the UM Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. The third PI directs a large network of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). In partnership with three local FQHCs,  SUCCESS will to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment. Building on these findings and existing community partnerships we will conduct cancer outreach tailored to the unique needs of each community. Our major research project is a randomized study among 600 women in our three communities who have not been adequately screened for cervical cancer. At each site, one third of the women would be exposed to standard NCI approved outreach interventions and a second group will receive a comprehensive home based CHW intervention encouraging women to have Pap Smear testing at one of the three FQHCs. While CHWs are a promising approach, many women exposed to this intervention remain unscreened. Thus we propose a third approach in which women at each site receive the CHW intervention but also have the option of screening through HPV testing done via home based self-sampling. Our experience in Little Haiti is that by coupling this innovative molecular technology with a CHW led culturally tailored approach nearly all women agree to be screened. The SUCCESS pilot project will be led by one of our minority junior faculty. Through a pre-post test design, she will examine the impact of a CHW led educational curriculum that has been specifically tailored women who are HIV positive. Lastly, our training core will develop formal seminars in health disparities research and CBPR for twelve clinical fellows and post-doctoral trainees and provide a more intensive longitudinal practicum and mentorship on community-based participatory research to four early stage investigators including a preparing a CBPR grant proposal.          The vision of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities.(SUCCESS) is that through increased cervical cancer screening we could eliminate cervical cancer health disparities in our local community.

"Salud es Vida: Reducing Access Barriers to Cervical Cancer Screening Among Unders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has highlighted the higher incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of cervical cancer among Hispanic women (Latinas) compared to non-Hispanic whites in the US. Effective community-based interventions are needed to address these health disparities, but the development of such interventions are limited by gaps in our understanding of: 1) cultural beliefs toward cervical cancer and HPV; and 2) effective intervention programs targeting specific priority populations, such as Latina farmworkers. The overall objective of this application is to develop an effective, culturally appropriate cervical cancer prevention intervention for low-income, Mexican farmworkers in southeast Georgia. The central hypothesis is that a multi-component intervention delivered by a trained, bilingual health educator targeted to low-income, Latina farmworkers will be more effective in increasing cervical cancer screening when compared to a media-only control condition. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that interventions using trained health educators are a culturally appropriate, effective strategy for increasing cervical cancer screening in rural Latina populations. The two specific aims are to: (1) develop a multi-component health educator intervention, which is informed by ethnographic research on knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and risk perceptions for cervical cancer and HPV, and screening behaviors among low-income, Mexican farmworker women; and (2) assess the relative efficacy of the multi-component health educator intervention for increasing the rate of cervical cancer screening among Mexican farmworker women who are non-users of cervical cancer screening when compared to a control condition. The contribution of the proposed research is expected to be the development of an effective and innovative multi-component intervention, which will consist of health-educator-led small group education sessions using an animated video and a flipchart, to increase cervical cancer screening among rural, Latina immigrants. The proposed research is innovative because a new multi-component intervention program will be developed and delivered by a health educator and targeted to a new immigrant Latino farmworker population in rural, underserved southern Georgia.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A better understanding of knowledge, risk perceptions, and cultural attitudes among various Hispanic subgroups around cervical cancer will assist in developing more effective outreach efforts and impacting cervical cancer disparities in groups suffering the greatest burden of the disease, thereby improving public health. The proposed study will develop an effective, culturally appropriate intervention using a health educator and lay health advisors to increase cervical cancer screening among low-income, Mexican farmworkers in southeast Georgia.           A better understanding of knowledge, risk perceptions, and cultural attitudes among various Hispanic subgroups around cervical cancer will assist in developing more effective outreach efforts and impacting cervical cancer disparities in groups suffering the greatest burden of the disease, thereby improving public health.

"Clarifying the effects of race and socioeconomic status on disparities in HPV vac     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black, Hispanic and low-income women are more likely to develop and die from cervical cancer than White women. With the introduction of HPV vaccine, clinicians have a remarkable opportunity to reduce these disparities. Unfortunately, minority and low-income women are also less likely to complete the HPV vaccine series. While HPV vaccine uptake is expected to reduce incidence and prevalence of cervical cancer over time, poor uptake of the vaccine by underserved women could actual increase disparities in cervical cancer rates The long-term objective of the proposed study, Clarifying the Effects of Race and Socioeconomic Status on Disparities in HPV Vaccination Rates, is to generate knowledge on which to base interventions to increase uptake of the vaccine among underserved women. The study has three aims:1) to characterize how perceptions of HPV vaccination differ by race and socioeconomic status among White, Black, and Hispanic parents of 11-18 year old girls attending public and private clinics; 2) to characterize providers' perceptions of barriers and facilitators to initiating and completing the HPV vaccine series, specifically focusing on the distinct contributions of race and socioeconomic status; and 3) to use the information gathered in Aims 1 and 2 to develop strategies for improving HPV vaccine initiation and completion overall, with a specific focus on reducing race and income-based disparities in complete vaccination rates. An innovative conceptual model, incorporating the Health Belief Model, the Transtheoretical Model, and the Theory of Planned Behavior will be used. To address the first aim, the investigators will conduct 30-45 minute qualitative interviews with 120 parents of adolescent girls to identify the barriers and facilitators to vaccine series completion. This study will sample Black, Hispanic, and White parents at public and private sites at each of three stages of vaccination: not initiated, incomplete, and complete. To achieve the second aim, 45-90 minute qualitative interviews will be conducted with 20 providers at public and private clinics to characterize knowledge, perceptions and beliefs of providers that serve as facilitators and barriers to HPV vaccine completion. Content analysis based in grounded theory will be used to identify common health beliefs, parental concerns and attitudes about HPV vaccination, social norms, barriers and other factors that influence series initiation and completion. To address the third aim, the investigators will solicit ideas from parents and providers, explore their receptiveness toward school-based solutions that have proved effective in other countries, and convene a meeting of key community stakeholders to discuss implementation of targeted solutions to improve HPV vaccine uptake among diverse groups.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black, Hispanic and low-income women are less likely to complete the HPV vaccine series, which could worsen disparities in cervical cancer rates. The proposed project is relevant to public health because it will allow us to explore the independent and additive effects of race and socioeconomic status on HPV vaccination in the adolescent daughters of minority women. We will use qualitative interviews with parents and providers, which allow a deep understanding of the interplay of factors, to identify targets and methodology for successful interventions.              Black, Hispanic and low-income women are less likely to complete the HPV vaccine series, which could worsen disparities in cervical cancer rates.

"Exploring Sociodemographic and Behavioral Factors Underlying Racial/Ethnic Dispar     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Through my doctoral and post-doctoral training, I have a broad background in cancer epidemiology, with specific training and expertise in nutrition. As a doctoral student at Yale University, I analyzed data from a large multicenter case-control study of esophageal and gastric cancers. As part of this study, I examined dietary and lifestyle risk factors, including the use of novel statistical approaches such as principle components analysis and classification and regression tree analysis. During my time at Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM), I analyzed data from the National Breast Screening Study (NBSS) where I examined the roles of various lifestyle and medical risk factors for numerous cancer outcomes. As a result of these experiences, I am aware of the importance of developing and maintaining successful collaborations through frequent communication among project members and of constructing a realistic research plan and timeline. My past training has provided me with the initial tools to conduct epidemiologic studies and led to my deep interest in racial/ethnic disparities in cancer outcomes. However, I lack the breadth of knowledge in three areas (Social Epidemiology, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Spatial Analyses) necessary to conduct and lead multidisciplinary studies of cancer prevention behaviors and cancer disparities. Further, due to lack of research mentoring opportunities at my current institution, an my heavy teaching load, my development as an independent researcher in this area has been limited.             To accomplish my career goal of becoming an independent investigator, and a recognized expert in the disparities in cancer outcomes, I am proposing a career development plan in which I will expand my training through coursework in social epidemiology, health disparities, and spatial analysis as well as through guided readings, regular meetings with mentors and consultants, center visits, and attendance at selected seminars, and conferences. I will be working with an outstanding mentoring team, including Drs. Demissie and Bandera (both at UMDNJ) and Dr. Jones (Yale University), all of whom are experts in the field of cancer prevention and control and health disparities and who have extensive experience mentoring masters and doctoral level students and junior faculty. The Department of Epidemiology at UMDNJ engages in a number of epidemiology activities, courses, and seminars, (www.umdnj.edu) including activities at the School of Public Health, the Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities (IEHD), and the Cancer Institute of New Jersey. Dr. Demissie, as Director of IEHD, and Dr. Bandera's work with CINJ, will also provide great opportunities for intellectual interactions and future collaborations with both of these institutes. In addition, we have identified a number of consultants, including Dr. Yu, who is at my home institution, who will provide training and assistance in GIS, Dr. Palmer who will provide assistance in recruiting participants from SNAP-Ed and EFNEP, Dr. Dubin who will provide expertise and assistance in statistical methodology and Drs. Natale-Periera and Echeverria who will provide expertise in health disparities and social epidemiology. During the entire period of the award, my department chair and college Dean, have agreed to provide substantial support to devote at least 9 person months (75% full-time professional effort) to develop my research program, which includes limiting my teaching load, supporting my salary that goes above and beyond the $100,000 cap for K awards, reducing my responsibility to represent the Department in College and University committees, and providing me with necessary resources including, office space, secretarial support, graduate student support, and access to computer support and library services.             The proposed K01 Career Development Award will also allow the development of an epidemiologic research program in Cancer Disparities in New Jersey. Breast and cervical cancer are leading causes of cancer for women in the United States, respectively and racial/ethnic disparities in diagnosis and mortality are well noted in the literature. These disparities are explained, in part, by unequal access to cancer screening across socioeconomic and racial groups, however little is known about the impact of perception of access to cancer screening on cancer screening behaviors. This study will assess the association between race/ethnicity, perceived access to screening, and individual-level socioeconomic (SES) and demographic factors and area-level characteristics, including SES, availability of low- or no-cost cervical cancer screening and mammography, on screening behavior using a cross-sectional study of low-income women enrolled in the New Jersey Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - Education (SNAP-Ed) or Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Programs (EFNEP). Multivariate models will examine the individual and joint effects of geographic and perceived access on adherence to breast and cervical cancer screening guidelines, after adjusting for individual- and area-level characteristics. These findings will serve to examine the complex interaction between socioeconomic status and health behaviors, how they differ between non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White and Hispanics, in New Jersey, which has one of the highest cancer rates in the nation. This project will also serve to develop preliminary data to support an R01 application proposing to conduct a larger scale study, and possibly, an intervention to address these issues in this community.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These findings will add to literature exploring the complex interaction between individual- and area-level measures of access to cancer screening and

"Kin Keeper:Reducing Disparities Through Cancer Literacy and Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of the phenomena health disparities requires researchers and public health educators to use many strategies to devise ways of reducing disparities and implement programs with the goal of eliminating those disparities. We are proposing to focus on breast and cervical cancer screening among Black, Latina, and Arab women living in the United States. This will be done by investigating the effectiveness of the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention, a female-family focused educational intervention for medically underserved women applied in a real world setting, using a randomized control trial design. The Kin KeeperSM model uses synergy and natural communication that exists among female family members to increase cancer prevention education and screening, which translates into functional cancer literacy. Simultaneously we will be using a two-step approach that also includes measuring the cost of the intervention, which is in important if the model is going to be sustained and have public utility in decreasing and ultimately eliminating cancer disparities. The goals of this research project are: 1) To determine if the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention increases first time and appropriately timed breast cancer screening rates among Black, Latina, and Arab women; 2) To determine if the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention increases first time and appropriately timed cervical cancer screening rates among Black, Latina, and Arab women; 3) To measure functional cancer literacy over time at the individual and family level and; 4) To assess costs and rates of health care utilization among women in the Kin KeeperSM model and the comparison group. By combining a community based approach with our university-community partnership as well as health services research methodology, we anticipate that we will have sustainable model to impact breast and cervical cancer disparities among medically underserved women.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this research will impact public health agencies and research on planning and intervention design; as to more effectively promote breast and cervical cancer screening and early detection for medically underserved women.

"Disparities in cervical cancer precursors and deregulation of imprinted genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although screening for uterine cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN) and its aggressive treatment has resulted in decreased cervical cancer incidence and mortality, an estimated 11,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) and 40,000 cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS) continue to be diagnosed every year in the United States. ICC incidence is 60% higher and mortality over two times higher in African Americans compared to whites. Such disparate rates in incidence and mortality are despite comparable screening rates to detect precursor lesions, comparable prevalence of 'high risk' human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the etiologic agent, and co-factors such as cigarette smoking. Reasons for such disparities are largely unknown. A more detailed understanding of the etiology of lesions that progress will improve risk stratification to distinguish women with a low risk of progression from those likely to rapidly progress to invasive cancer. We posit that deregulation of genomically imprinted genes, a group of approximately 50 known growth-regulatory genes where only one allele is normally active, may predict progression to cervical cancer. We found that a substantial group of imprinted genes exhibit altered expression in ICC versus normal cervical epithelium. In addition, methylation analysis of two regulatory regions controlling IGF2 expression shows deviation from normal in specimens with CIN2-CIN3 classification and more profound deviation in invasive cancers. Together, these findings suggest that imprinted genes are deregulated in ICC and these features may improve detection of CIN cases likely to progress. Our central hypothesis is that deregulation at imprint regulatory elements of imprinted genes, likely influenced by environmental exposures, increases risk of progression to cervical cancer in women infected with 'high risk' HPV. We have already shown racial variation on the effect of environmental exposures on imprint deregulation, and thus, further hypothesize that higher risk in African Americans and Hispanics is due to race/ethnic differences in deregulation of these genes. Our specific aims are to: (1) determine if deregulation of imprint regulatory elements of known imprinted genes is associated with increased risk of progression of CIN1 to CIN2+, and whether this association varies by race/ethnicity; (2) determine whether aberrant methylation of imprint regulatory elements in cervical cells is similar to that found in peripheral blood cells, suggesting an early event; and associated with (i) transcriptional expression, and (ii) loss of imprinting; (3) evaluate whether deregulation of known imprinted genes in cervical cells can be used to discriminate women with CIN2+ among 500 Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance (ASCUS) cases. To address the Aims, we will recruit and follow 1,500 women with CIN1 and 500 with ASCUS, and examine the association between aberrant methylation markers at imprinted regulatory elements of 12 genes and progression from CIN1 to CIN2+. We will then test the performance of these markers to identify CIN2+ cases from among 500 ASCUS cases. Data from the proposed study will improve triage decisions and reduce disparities in ICC morbidity and mortality.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although screening for cervical intraepithelial lesions to prevent cervical cancer has resulted in decreased cancer incidence and mortality, an estimated 11,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer and 40,000 carcinomas in situ cases continue to be diagnosed every year in the United States with incidence 60% higher and mortality >2-times higher in African Americans compared to whites. We will recruit and follow 1,500 CIN1 and 500 cases of Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance (ASCUS), and examine the association between aberrant methylation at imprinted regulatory elements of 12 genes and progression to CIN2 or worse and then test the performance of these markers in ASCUS cases, independent of known co-factors. Data from this study will elucidate the role of epigenetic deregulation in CIN2+ and inform triage decisions, reducing disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality.

"Message Framing and HPV Vaccination Acceptance among African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant racial disparities exist in the incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer in the US, despite an overall decline in these rates for the population as a whole. In particular, African American women are significantly more likely to get and die from cervical cancer than non-Hispanic White women. African Americans, however, are also among the group that holds the least favorable attitudes toward the new human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine recommended for young women to prevent cervical cancer. There is a tremendous need for developing effective communication interventions about HPV vaccination targeting caretakers of vaccine-eligible young African American women. Previous research indicates that framing a health message in terms of the benefits that may be achieved by performing the recommended behavior versus the costs that may be incurred by not following the recommendation could systematically influence message efficacy. Despite extensive research on message framing, little is known about the effects of message framing on HPV vaccination acceptance among caretakers of vaccine-eligible young African American women and the extent to which these effects may be moderated by the caretakers' vaccine-related beliefs such as perceived vaccine safety and efficacy. To advance scientific knowledge on how message framing can be used to foster HPV vaccination acceptance in African American communities, we will conduct a community-based randomized trial with 150 caretakers of vaccine-eligible young African American women ages 9-17 to assess the relative efficacy of gain- vs. loss-framed messages. The proposed project will provide useful insights into the design of targeted messages to improve HPV vaccination acceptance among caretakers of vaccine-eligible young African American women. This study will also set the stage for a program of research aimed at developing theory-based communication interventions for promoting HPV vaccination in African American communities, with the ultimate goal of reducing and eliminating racial disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates.        The primary objective of the proposed study is to test the relative efficacy of two communication strategies in promoting HPV vaccination acceptance among caretakers of vaccine-eligible young African American women. If successful, this project will help understand message framing effects in the promotion of HPV vaccination and provide useful insights into the design of targeted messages to improve HPV vaccination acceptance among caretakers of vaccine-eligible young African American women.

"University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center Over 6 million new cases of sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPVs) infections are reported every year making HPV the most common sexually transmitted agent world-wide. At least 15 carcinogenic HPV types cause virtually all cervical cancers however; the costly HPV vaccine licensed in 2006 covers only HPV types 6/11/16/18 and has no therapeutic effect on established infections. Thus all women must continue routine cervical screening at a US cost of $4-5 billion annually. More importantly, the majority of women alive today are still at risk for developing cervical cancer. In addition, the current vaccine program presently leaves all men unprotected. Given these considerations and the fact that cervical cancer is a disease of disparities, it is unlikely that projected disease reductions will be realized with current strategies. Programs to characterize current US HPV vaccine implementation and effectiveness are needed and continuing efforts to better understand HPV biology and to develop broadly protective prevention strategies and therapeutics for existing infections remain critical. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To establish the University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center that incorporates research approaches to address these gaps in knowledge. 2) To fund and support 4 projects representing a spectrum of interdisciplinary approaches including: A) modeling of PV-host interactions in 3 dimensions to define elements of epithelial cell biology and immunity that contribute to the pathogenesis and prevention of infections; B) utilizing novel vaccine strategies based on virus-display technology to generate broad protection against a majority of HPV infections; C) utilizing a unique bioinformatics system that captures all events of a US population-based cervical screening program to characterize implementation and effectiveness of primary and secondary HPV interventions; and D) developing a set of web-based tools to promote the informed adoption of HPV and other STI prevention. 3) To establish 2 cores housing shared resources to support these interdisciplinary research approaches: A) a biostatistics and bioinformatics core and B) a virus infection core supporting technologies for virus production, quantitation, and animal imaging and housing a biospecimen resource. The University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary STI Prevention Center will focus on the most common sexually transmitted agents, human papillomavirus (HPV) infections.

"Tailoring an Intervention with Parents in Rural Areas to Reduce HPV Transmission     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tailoring an Intervention with Parents in Rural Areas to Reduce HPV Transmission Women who live in rural areas are dying at higher rates from cervical cancer related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection than their urban counterparts, and yet 3.7 billion healthcare dollars are spent each year for the treatment of HPV infection, genital warts, and cervical cancer.1-4 These human and fiscal costs could be markedly reduced if the HPV vaccine, a series of three shots over six months, is given prior to first sexual contact.4-6 However, for children to be protected against HPV infection, parents must give consent.6 Unfortunately in rural areas, rates of HPV vaccination are very low, less than 20% in some counties.4 The HPV vaccine was approved in 2006 for girls and in December 2009 for males ages 9 to 26 though there are no statistics available for male vaccination yet.7-10 National incidence rates of cervical cancer and other HPV related cancers are disproportionately higher for women living in the rural areas where geographic disparities emerge from large distances traveled to access healthcare resources.9-11 The health disparities affecting families living in rural areas of Georgia are well documented, providing a compelling reason to choose this population for study.11-15 Past research studies have focused on parents and HPV vaccination but many of these were completed prior to vaccine availability, relied on self-report, and focused predominantly on women living in urban areas seeking clinical services.16-23 These studies provided valuable information though they cannot be generalized to parents living in rural areas. In addition, there are no qualitative studies that address low HP vaccination rates in rural areas of Georgia. Any intervention developed to reduce HPV transmission and HPV-related cancers, such as cervical cancer, must include parental input as only the parent/caregiver (P/C) can provide consent for HPV vaccination.24-26 Since there is evidence that mistrust of healthcare interventions persists, particularly among African Americans, the proposed study will use an anonymous focus group approach to provide narrative data to explicate a better understanding of why parents choose to vaccinate their children ages 9 to 13 with the HPV vaccine.27-29 Results from a completed quantitative pilot form the basis of the questions to be asked in this proposed focus group study; these questions will be posed by focus group leaders who are trained by the Principal Investigator (PI). We expect to collect greater amounts of in-depth, culturally rich information using this qualitative method and then develop a tailored intervention that will emerge from the focus group data to increase HPV vaccine rates thereby reducing HPV transmission.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative Almost 4 billion healthcare dollars are spent each year for the treatment of HPV infection including genital warts, cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers. These human and fiscal costs can be reduced if the HPV vaccine is given prior to first sexual contact. However, for children to be protected against HPV infection, parents must give consent. This study will collect focus group data from parents with children ages 9 to 13 who reside in rural Georgia to identify the reasons why they do or do not vaccinate their children with the HPV Vaccine.             ",Tailoring an Intervention with Parents in Rural Areas to Reduce HPV Transmission,8284539,R03NR013558,"['Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Age ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Venereal Warts ', ' Genital Warts ', ' Condylomata Acuminata ', ' Condyloma Accuminata ', ' Anogenital venereal warts ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Incidence ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' statistics ', ' Research ', ' Parents ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Clinical ', ' urban area ', ' Vaccination ', ' Woman ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' rural area ', ' base ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccines ', ' Travel ', ' preference ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' Rural ', ' Cervical ', ' Training ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family history of ', ' Series ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' girls ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' cost ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Characteristics ', ' Population ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Consent ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2012,80397,0.22130776016436332
"Understanding Health Disparities in cervical dysplasia and cancer through the ide    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in women in developing nations. When stratified by race in United States, African American and Hispanic women have both higher incidence and mortality from cervical cancer than Caucasian women. These disparities are in part due to access to healthcare and screening, but even after accounting for this, African American and Hispanic women continue to have higher mortality rates. This grant application describes potential biomarkers that may help begin to understand the differences in progression of the preneoplastic stages of cervical cancer between African American, Hispanic, Caucasian women. The identification of such biomarkers will help determine the biological basis for the observed disparities in the incidences as well as mortality of cervical cancer. In addition, these biomarkers will be useful to identify, among the many women who present with Pap test abnormalities, the few that are at high risk of developing cancer. This will allow for considerable reduction in morbidity as well as cost savings in Pap test follow-up procedures, at the same time providing better, more aggressive care to those who truly need it.         The incidence of cervical cancer is 50% higher in African American women and 66% higher in Hispanic women with mortality rates two-fold higher than what is found in Caucasian women. The disparities among races in part can be attributed to differences in screening and access to healthcare, but after controlling for these factors these disparities persist suggesting that there may be individual susceptibilities to HPV infections. The overall goal of our research is to identify biomarkers that can help predict which women are at highest risk for developing cervical cancer, thus reducing the health disparities that exist for cervical cancer.

"An HPV Health Communication Randomized Controlled Trial Intervention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Sherrie Wallington, PhD, MA, Assistant Professor of Oncology;, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC), Georgetown University (GUMC) Medical Center, Washington, DC. Dr. Wallington's chief academic and research goal is to transition to independence as a social and behavioral scientist investigating the role of health communication to address cancer health disparities.  Environment: Georgetown University's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center is a high-quality research environment and is well suited for the success of Dr. Wallington's career development experience, proposed research, and her transition to an independent scientist. In the event of an award, the institution is committed to ensuring that Dr. Wallington fulfills all the requirement of this award, as detailed in the Director's letter (see Institutional Environment component of this proposal).  Research: This proposed research emphasizes the need to increase knowledge of the human papillomavirus (HPV) and the HPV vaccine among low-income African-American mothers, a population that lacks HPV knowledge and has a high incidence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is estimated to be the most common sexually transmitted infection. High-risk HPV types can cause cervical, anal, and other genital cancers. However, public awareness and understanding of the sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses and the available HPV vaccine are low, particularly among racial ethnic minorities and women of low socioeconomic status. In the District of Columbia (DC), legislation passed in 2007 mandates that all female students enrolling in the sixth grade at a DC school must received the HPV vaccine or not received the HPV vaccine because of an opt-out clause. Many DC parents and community groups have questioned the efficacy of the vaccine, the clarity of the current opt-out form, and the failure of DC to provide a visible HPV public information campaign. DC has the highest cervical cancer rates in the United States. This lack of HPV education is leading to significant knowledge gaps and communication inequalities, particularly among minority and underserved populations, in the access to information and the inability of parents to make informed decisions with balanced and accurate information. To achieve a significant effect on combating cervical cancer, eliminating HPV knowledge gaps is essential. One strategy is to first educate mothers. Thus, this study seeks to develop a health communication randomized controlled HPV educational intervention in DC that targets African-American mothers who have unvaccinated daughters between the ages of 9 and 17. Participants will be randomized into one of two arms, a group intervention arm or a wait-listed control group arm. The specific aims and hypotheses to be tested are: Aim 1: To conduct a randomized controlled trial health communication intervention to increase knowledge awareness about HPV and the HPV vaccine among low socioeconomic status African-American mothers. H1: African-American mothers receiving the group educational intervention will have greater HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge awareness compared to the wait-listed control group; and Aim 2: To assess the factors associated with mothers acceptability or non-acceptability of the HPV vaccine for their daughters. H2: Mothers receiving the group educational intervention will have greater HPV vaccine acceptability for their daughters than the wait-listed control group.

"A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among Pacific Islander Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among PI Women ABSTRACT Despite the fact that cervical cancer is one of the most preventable of cancers, it remains one of the top five causes of cancer deaths in the U.S. and in California. The Pap test has been shown to be effective in not only detecting cancer but also precancerous cells. Even with the introduction of HPV testing and vaccines, Pap tests represent an important cervical cancer prevention and early detection method for women in this country. Unfortunately, the Pap test is severely underutilized among many ethnic and racial populations, including Pacific Islanders (PIs) who have high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality data among specific PI ethnic groups is sparse, with available information underscoring significant cancer health disparities. In California as in the Pacific, cervical cancer is one of the top five causes of cancer deaths. Given the dearth of PI researchers and studies at the NIH level, community-based participatory research (CBPR) holds the potential for engaging community cultural experts alongside cancer health disparities researchers to address their pressing cervical cancer detection needs. This five year cluster unit randomized trial will develop and evaluate a social support intervention targeting both men and women to increase Pap testing decision making and behavior among Chamorro, Samoan and Tongan women age 18-65 years old in Southern California. We aim to: 1. Apply CBPR principles and processes for community/university partners throughout the grant period; 2. Develop and pretest two gender-specific and culturally tailored educational interventions for PI women and men. The interventions will be conducted separately by gender, and will employ a video, flipchart, and brochure, along with small-group discussions facilitated by gender-matched community health educators; 3. Develop and validate instruments measuring men's social support (provided), women's social support (perceived) and women's decision making utility; 4. Recruit and randomly assign community-based organizational samples and recruit and follow the cohorts of PI females and males in the intervention and control groups 5. Examine the associations that test the conceptual model regarding social support, decision making utility, and Pap testing intentions and behaviors; 6. Follow the cohort of PI women and men in the intervention vs. control groups to assess the impact of the intervention. Using a longitudinal cohort design, we will identify, recruit, and randomly assign PI members of churches and other community-based organizations to one of two intervention options: a) a culturally tailored social support intervention group for women and men consisting of community health educator-facilitated video, flipchart and brochure; or b) a usual care control group, consisting of pre-existing cancer education materials (brochures) for PI women and men delivered by community health educators. We posit that the planned social support intervention will increase men's provision, and women's perceptions, of Pap testing social support, leading to increases in women's prioritization of Pap testing decision making utility and Pap testing behaviors. The proposed study team involves long-standing university and community collaborators, and uses a multiple PI model to institutionalize shared participation and leadership structures. The community side of this CBPR study includes three CBOs with years of experience in health promotion, disease prevention, and collaborative research for their respective PI populations. The university side includes experienced behavioral scientists in CBPR, cancer control and decision making with multiethnic populations. This study will add to the existing science of cancer health disparities by adapting and applying well-established behavioral theories to understand the ways in which collectivist-oriented interventions influence individual women's cancer screening behavioral changes. Furthermore, this study will illuminate the CBPR engagement aspects necessary to conduct rigorous intervention research in small-size populations. The product of this study will be a culturally-tailored intervention that holds the potential to become a model for other collectivistic populations. Strengths of this study include: i) a focus on a major cancer health disparity; ii) development and testing of methods that are applicable to other health disparities; iii) a theoretical focus on decision making (a priority area for NCI regarding translational research); iv) an intervention approach that investigates and develops new strategies to improve cultural tailoring and evaluation; v) a focus on men; and vi) an ethnically diverse team of community and university investigators with an established track record in CBPR research.

"Examining Disparities in Cancer Screening for Persons with Disabilities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today in the U.S., at least 54 million persons live with disabilities, and these numbers will increase substantially in coming decades with the aging ""baby boomers."" At the other end of the life span, rising numbers of children and young adults are also living with disabilities. Healthy People 2020, as well as research and epidemiological studies, have found that persons with disabilities frequently experience large health care disparities. In particular, evidence documents much lower rates of screening for breast and cervical cancers. Various factors could contribute to these disparities in cancer screening. Nonetheless, little research has systematically explored factors associated with cancer screening disparities for persons with disabilities.  The overall purpose of this project is to use data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 1998 through 2010 to understand better the patterns, trends, and potential contributors to screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers among persons with disabilities. We plan to build our analyses around the World Health Organization's model of disability. In addition to more global indicators of disabilit, we plan to look specifically at self-reported impairments relating to: vision (blind and low vision; hearing (deaf and hard of hearing); movement difficulties; cognitive difficulties; and mental health concerns. Our major specific aims are to: 1. Compare rates of screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers between persons with and without  disabilities, cross-sectionally and over time; 2. Identify and compare those factors associated with receipt of breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer  screening for persons with and without disabilities, respectively, cross-sectionally and over time; and 3. Identify those factors that explain any observed disparities in breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer  screening between persons with and without disabilities, cross-sectionally and over time.  NHIS did not ask questions about all three cancer screening services during each year; we must therefore restrict the analyses for each type of screening service to those years where information was collected. We shall consider a variety of independent variables as covariates in multivariable models to predict cancer screening, including: specific types of disabilities; interactions among disability types; demographic characteristics, such as age, sex (colorectal cancer), race, ethnicity, education, household composition, household income, geographic region, and urban-rural residence; comorbid health conditions, such as cardio respiratory diseases and diabetes; health behavior-related attributes, such as body mass index and tobacco use; and health care delivery system considerations, such as having health insurance and a usual source of care. In addition to other statistical methods, we shall explore the factors most associated with identified cancer screening disparities using the Peters-Belson analytical approach.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  At least 54 million Americans live with disabilities, and they generally face the same risks of developing cancers as do persons without disabilities - sometimes perhaps even greater risks because of higher rates of smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity. Women with disabilities have much lower rates than do other women of being screened for breast and cervical cancers (mammograms and Pap smears, respectively). The purpose of this project is to use national health survey data across multiple years to explore those factors most associated with disparities in screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers among persons with different types of disabilities.               At least 54 million Americans live with disabilities, and they generally face the same risks of developing cancers as do persons without disabilities - sometimes perhaps even greater risks because of higher rates of smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity.

"HPV and Cancer mHealth Prevention Education for HIV Positive Women Pilot Study  The candidate is a research assistant professor with academic training in health promotion, education, and behavior, as well as postdoctoral training in HIV/AIDS prevention, health disparities, and health services research. She also has data management expertise and clinical immunology experience. The candidate has completed two pilot studies that examined HPV infection and cervical cancer prevention knowledge, beliefs and screening behaviors among women living with HIV (WLH). The candidate is seeking additional training needed to develop and implement effective cancer health (including mHealth) communication and community navigation strategies to improve WLH's timely use of cancer screening, diagnostic and treatment services and procedures. The candidate's long-term goal is to obtain extramural research funding for her independent research program focusing on the prevention and control of HPV-mediated cancers among WLH over the next 5-10 years. Promotion to associate professor (tenure- or research-track) is an intermediate goal that the candidate is striving to attain within the next five years. A combination of formal didactic training and experiential learning opportunities will be used to acquire cancer prevention and control research skills in the following areas: cancer health (including mHealth) communication, cancer epidemiology, HPV-mediated cancer biology, community navigation, advanced epidemiological research skills (e.g., social epidemiology, n- of-1 research study designs, and, multilevel modeling). The candidate will use the cancer prevention and control research and health communication knowledge and skills acquired through the proposed career development award to conduct formative research needed to inform intervention development in which she will examine cancer health information seeking and sharing among WLH as well as their non-clinical HIV service providers (e.g., HIV/STI risk reduction counselors). Non-clinical HIV service providers will be included because, in addition to the fact that these individuals are already promoting safe sexual practices among WLH, they are also able to reach marginalized groups of WLH such as those who are homeless. This includes sheltered and unsheltered homeless WLH. The candidate's mentors and co-mentors have scientific expertise and community-based participatory research experience that will increase the likelihood of the proposed specific aims being successfully completed. The candidate will first examine HPV-mediated cancer prevention knowledge, beliefs and behaviors, as well as cancer health communication seeking and sharing behaviors (including the use of technology to find health information) (Aim 1). These formative research data will then be used to inform the development (Aim 2) and subsequent pilot testing and evaluation (Aim 3) of an HPV- mediated cancer prevention mHealth education intervention aimed at training WLH who already serve as peer leaders and non-clinical HIV service providers to use mHealth tools and community navigation strategies to disseminate HPV-mediated cancer prevention education. As community navigators, these individuals will use cancer health (including mHealth) communication and community navigation strategies to increase awareness about HPV-mediated cancer risk. This will include promoting cancer risk reducing behaviors such as safe sexual practices and the timely use of recommended cancer screening, diagnostic, and treatment services and procedures). Recall and reminder messages will be sent for screening and follow-up cancer care appointments. User-defined social support messages will also be sent to WLH who may be encountering access to cancer care barriers. The candidate will disseminate the scientific research findings to local, regional, national, and international audiences via presentations that she will give at scientific conferences and annual meetings as well as peer-reviewed publications that she will produce. Most relevant to the candidate's long-term goal of attaining research independence is increasing her number of peer-reviewed publications from her current publication rate of approximately three per year to four or more produced annually by the end of the 5-year training period and the submission of at least one grant proposal (e.g., R01-level funding) by the end of the 5-year training period. The proposed career development/training and research activities will enable the candidate to realize her long-term career goal of becoming an independent cancer researcher with expertise in using cancer health communication, community navigation, and mHealth technologies to address health system failures encountered by vulnerable, medically-underserved WLH along the cancer care continuum. Continued mentoring and opportunities for team science research collaborations will facilitate the candidate's successful progression to being an independent cancer researcher. WLH and non-clinical HIV service providers will be recruited from Ryan White funded clinics and AIDS-service organizations located in urban and rural geographical areas of South Carolina that represent a microcosm of disparities in HIV/AIDS, cancer, and other chronic illness that disproportionately burden medically underserved minority populations. Addressing health system failures that occur along the cancer care continuum that result in missed opportunities to prevent, detect, diagnose and treat HPV-mediated cancers will help to reduce the burden of cancer incidence and mortality among this high cancer risk, vulnerable group of WLH. The proposed HPV-mediated cancer mHealth prevention education intervention will be conducted in a community-based setting and builds upon an existing academic-community partnership between the candidate and a local AIDS-service organization. The candidate has a supportive, resource-intensive scientific environment for her cancer research training. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-positive women, who are predominantly African-American (AA) with an already disproportionate burden of cervical cancer, have a greater risk for developing cervical cancer as well as other HPV-mediated anogenital and head-and-neck cancers because of their weakened immune systems that decrease their body's ability to clear potentially oncogenic HPV infection. Innovative community-driven mHealth solutions focused on addressing cancer prevention knowledge deficits and promoting adherence to recommended cancer screening, detection and treatment services and procedures will be developed and evaluated. Mobile technologies are a promising, cost-effective approach to reducing these cancer health disparities among women living with HIV/AIDS by improving HPV-mediated cancer health outcomes and timely use of cancer care services for this high cancer risk, vulnerable group of largely medically underserved women.            ",HPV and Cancer mHealth Prevention Education for HIV Positive Women Pilot

"A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among Pacific Islander Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among PI Women ABSTRACT Despite the fact that cervical cancer is one of the most preventable of cancers, it remains one of the top five causes of cancer deaths in the U.S. and in California. The Pap test has been shown to be effective in not only detecting cancer but also precancerous cells. Even with the introduction of HPV testing and vaccines, Pap tests represent an important cervical cancer prevention and early detection method for women in this country. Unfortunately, the Pap test is severely underutilized among many ethnic and racial populations, including Pacific Islanders (PIs) who have high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality data among specific PI ethnic groups is sparse, with available information underscoring significant cancer health disparities. In California as in the Pacific, cervical cancer is one of the top five causes of cancer deaths. Given the dearth of PI researchers and studies at the NIH level, community-based participatory research (CBPR) holds the potential for engaging community cultural experts alongside cancer health disparities researchers to address their pressing cervical cancer detection needs. This five year cluster unit randomized trial will develop and evaluate a social support intervention targeting both men and women to increase Pap testing decision making and behavior among Chamorro, Samoan and Tongan women age 18-65 years old in Southern California. We aim to: 1. Apply CBPR principles and processes for community/university partners throughout the grant period; 2. Develop and pretest two gender-specific and culturally tailored educational interventions for PI women and men. The interventions will be conducted separately by gender, and will employ a video, flipchart, and brochure, along with small-group discussions facilitated by gender-matched community health educators; 3. Develop and validate instruments measuring men's social support (provided), women's social support (perceived) and women's decision making utility; 4. Recruit and randomly assign community-based organizational samples and recruit and follow the cohorts of PI females and males in the intervention and control groups 5. Examine the associations that test the conceptual model regarding social support, decision making utility, and Pap testing intentions and behaviors; 6. Follow the cohort of PI women and men in the intervention vs. control groups to assess the impact of the intervention. Using a longitudinal cohort design, we will identify, recruit, and randomly assign PI members of churches and other community-based organizations to one of two intervention options: a) a culturally tailored social support intervention group for women and men consisting of community health educator-facilitated video, flipchart and brochure; or b) a usual care control group, consisting of pre-existing cancer education materials (brochures) for PI women and men delivered by community health educators. We posit that the planned social support intervention will increase men's provision, and women's perceptions, of Pap testing social support, leading to increases in women's prioritization of Pap testing decision making utility and Pap testing behaviors. The proposed study team involves long-standing university and community collaborators, and uses a multiple PI model to institutionalize shared participation and leadership structures. The community side of this CBPR study includes three CBOs with years of experience in health promotion, disease prevention, and collaborative research for their respective PI populations. The university side includes experienced behavioral scientists in CBPR, cancer control and decision making with multiethnic populations. This study will add to the existing science of cancer health disparities by adapting and applying well-established behavioral theories to understand the ways in which collectivist-oriented interventions influence individual women's cancer screening behavioral changes. Furthermore, this study will illuminate the CBPR engagement aspects necessary to conduct rigorous intervention research in small-size populations. The product of this study will be a culturally-tailored intervention that holds the potential to become a model for other collectivistic populations. Strengths of this study include: i) a focus on a major cancer health disparity; ii) development and testing of methods that are applicable to other health disparities; iii) a theoretical focus on decision making (a priority area for NCI regarding translational research); iv) an intervention approach that investigates and develops new strategies to improve cultural tailoring and evaluation; v) a focus on men; and vi) an ethnically diverse team of community and university investigators with an established track record in CBPR research. Pacific Islanders (PIs) experience some of the highest cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in the U.S., yet little research exists on the ways to address and ameliorate their cancer health disparities. This five year randomized community-based participatory research study will develop and test a social support intervention targeting both PI men and women to increase women's Pap testing among three populations in Southern California: Chamorros, Tongans and Samoans. This study will add to the existing science of cancer health disparities by adapting and applying well-established behavioral theories to understand the ways in which collectivistic-oriented interventions influence individual women's cancer screening decision making and behaviors.

"Etiology of cervical cancer health disparity in American Indian women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in women worldwide. American Indian (AI) women living on the Northern Plains have a greater incidence of cervical cancer and suffer from a higher mortality rate. Our recent studies have shown that AI women have more than twice the incidence of HPV infection and that HPV positive AI women have a two times higher likelihood of having abnormal PAP tests than HPV positive Caucasian women; suggesting underlying causes which increase HPV pathology. One potential cofactor may be smoke exposure and its effects on the host immune response and HPV oncogenesis. Our data indicate that 4 times more AI women smoke as compared to Caucasian women and the majority of HPV positive AI women smoke. While smoking is a recognized risk factor for cervical cancer, the molecular interactions between HPV and smoke compounds are unknown. Our laboratory has recently shown that smoke carcinogen Benzo[a]Pyrene (BaP) increases the expression of HPV oncoproteins, suggesting a direct molecular link between HPV infection and exposure to smoke. We have also identified that curcumin, a natural anti-cancer compound, effectively inhibits the expression of HPV oncoproteins. Based on this compelling evidence, we hypothesize that exposure to tobacco smoke synergizes with HPV infection and increases the incidence and severity of cervical cancer in American Indian women by increasing the expression of HPV oncoproteins (E6/E7) and modulating cellular/humoral immune responses. Additionally, we hypothesize that curcumin or nanocurcumin may be effective methods for the repression of HPV infection in AI women. We propose to 1) investigate novel mechanisms of synergy between HPV infection, BaP and the development of cervical cancer, 2) evaluate the efficacy of curcumin/nanocurcumin to suppress HPV oncogene expression in preclinical and clinical settings, and 3) to investigate the effect of smoke exposure on cervical immune responses. The results of this study will provide information regarding underlying etiological factors that are responsible for cervical cancer health disparity in AI women and will ultimately reduce the burden of cervical cancer.

"Examining Disparities in Cancer Screening for Persons with Disabilities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today in the U.S., at least 54 million persons live with disabilities, and these numbers will increase substantially in coming decades with the aging ""baby boomers."" At the other end of the life span, rising numbers of children and young adults are also living with disabilities. Healthy People 2020, as well as research and epidemiological studies, have found that persons with disabilities frequently experience large health care disparities. In particular, evidence documents much lower rates of screening for breast and cervical cancers. Various factors could contribute to these disparities in cancer screening. Nonetheless, little research has systematically explored factors associated with cancer screening disparities for persons with disabilities.  The overall purpose of this project is to use data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 1998 through 2010 to understand better the patterns, trends, and potential contributors to screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers among persons with disabilities. We plan to build our analyses around the World Health Organization's model of disability. In addition to more global indicators of disabilit, we plan to look specifically at self-reported impairments relating to: vision (blind and low vision; hearing (deaf and hard of hearing); movement difficulties; cognitive difficulties; and mental health concerns. Our major specific aims are to: 1. Compare rates of screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers between persons with and without  disabilities, cross-sectionally and over time; 2. Identify and compare those factors associated with receipt of breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer  screening for persons with and without disabilities, respectively, cross-sectionally and over time; and 3. Identify those factors that explain any observed disparities in breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer  screening between persons with and without disabilities, cross-sectionally and over time.  NHIS did not ask questions about all three cancer screening services during each year; we must therefore restrict the analyses for each type of screening service to those years where information was collected. We shall consider a variety of independent variables as covariates in multivariable models to predict cancer screening, including: specific types of disabilities; interactions among disability types; demographic characteristics, such as age, sex (colorectal cancer), race, ethnicity, education, household composition, household income, geographic region, and urban-rural residence; comorbid health conditions, such as cardio respiratory diseases and diabetes; health behavior-related attributes, such as body mass index and tobacco use; and health care delivery system considerations, such as having health insurance and a usual source of care. In addition to other statistical methods, we shall explore the factors most associated with identified cancer screening disparities using the Peters-Belson analytical approach.           At least 54 million Americans live with disabilities, and they generally face the same risks of developing cancers as do persons without disabilities - sometimes perhaps even greater risks because of higher rates of smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity. Women with disabilities have much lower rates than do other women of being screened for breast and cervical cancers (mammograms and Pap smears, respectively). The purpose of this project is to use national health survey data across multiple years to explore those factors most associated with disparities in screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers among persons with different types of disabilities.

"University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center Over 6 million new cases of sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPVs) infections are reported every year making HPV the most common sexually transmitted agent world-wide. At least 15 carcinogenic HPV types cause virtually all cervical cancers however; the costly HPV vaccine licensed in 2006 covers only HPV types 6/11/16/18 and has no therapeutic effect on established infections. Thus all women must continue routine cervical screening at a US cost of $4-5 billion annually. More importantly, the majority of women alive today are still at risk for developing cervical cancer. In addition, the current vaccine program presently leaves all men unprotected. Given these considerations and the fact that cervical cancer is a disease of disparities, it is unlikely that projected disease reductions will be realized with current strategies. Programs to characterize current US HPV vaccine implementation and effectiveness are needed and continuing efforts to better understand HPV biology and to develop broadly protective prevention strategies and therapeutics for existing infections remain critical. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To establish the University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center that incorporates research approaches to address these gaps in knowledge. 2) To fund and support 4 projects representing a spectrum of interdisciplinary approaches including: A) modeling of PV-host interactions in 3 dimensions to define elements of epithelial cell biology and immunity that contribute to the pathogenesis and prevention of infections; B) utilizing novel vaccine strategies based on virus-display technology to generate broad protection against a majority of HPV infections; C) utilizing a unique bioinformatics system that captures all events of a US population-based cervical screening program to characterize implementation and effectiveness of primary and secondary HPV interventions; and D) developing a set of web-based tools to promote the informed adoption of HPV and other STI prevention. 3) To establish 2 cores housing shared resources to support these interdisciplinary research approaches: A) a biostatistics and bioinformatics core and B) a virus infection core supporting technologies for virus production, quantitation, and animal imaging and housing a biospecimen resource. The University of New Mexico Interdisciplinary STI Prevention Center will focus on the most common sexually transmitted agents, human papillomavirus (HPV) infections.

"Cervical, Anal & Oral HPV Persistence/Adolescent Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Adolescents and young women have the highest rates of cervical HPV, including infection with the HPV types causing significant morbidity and mortality. Introduction of the FDA-approved quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil(R), Merck & Co.) targeting HPV16 and HPV18 (high-risk [HR] types present in >65% of cervical cancers), as well as HPV6 and 11 (associated with most genital warts), has the potential to reduce the burden of genital HPV and disease. HPV vaccine clinical trials focused exclusively on low-risk women with limited numbers of sexual partners who were highly compliant with the vaccine schedule; these females were not representative of those most at risk to suffer from HPV-related disease. In fact, Hispanic and African-American women have the highest and second highest incidence rates of cervical cancer in the U.S., respectively, and high mortality rates from cervical cancer. In addition, the associations of HPV-related anal and/or oropharyngeal lesions are an important public health concern, yet few vaccine studies in women have evaluated HPV at these sites. Subsequent to the approval and release of GARDASIL, we initiated a prospective cohort study of sexually- active, inner-city, minority adolescent women attending the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center (MSAHC), the largest comprehensive adolescent primary care facility in the U.S. To date, this project has enrolled more than 750 sexually active teens between the ages of 12-19. Prevalent HPV infection at enrollment was detected in 54% of cervical, 42% of anal and 20% of oral specimens, with vaccine types (HPV 6/11, 16 & 18) present in 7%, 6% and 1% of adolescents, respectively. Adolescents who had three doses were at significantly reduced risk of HPV vaccine types in the cervix compared to those who had no vaccination. With respect to extracervical sites, non-significant reductions were observed for HR-HPV vaccine types in the anal and oral cavities when comparing fully vaccinated to non-vaccinated adolescents. There was considerable incident (4.2 per 100 person years) detection of cervical HPV 16/18 infection not present at enrollment despite vaccination; this observed rate is substantially above that reported in the efficacy trials. We propose to address the health disparities of HPV in minority young women by continuing our cohort study of high-risk adolescent females participating in an HPV immunization program at MSAHC. We propose to extend the prospective follow-up (with repeat visits every 6 months) to evaluate the long-term burden of infection and to increase sample size to just over 1,400 subjects to improve statistical power. The increased sample size and longer follow-up will allow us to determine risk factors for break-through HPV infections, as well as integrate a new aim to evaluate psychosocial elements of adolescent development and high-risk behaviors in teens. Data obtained from this study will be essential to understanding the 'real-world' impact of HPV vaccination in this group not studied in the vaccine trials and will provide the biological underpinnings for future HPV and cervical cancer screening practices, as well as estimating the potential impact of vaccine on anal and/or oropharyngeal HPV infections.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescents and young women have the highest rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, including infection with the HPV types causing high-grade neoplasia, cervical and anal cancer. This study investigates the continued burden of HPV in a population of high-risk, predominantly Hispanic and African-American inner- city adolescent women not previously included in the large randomized clinical trials of the HPV vaccine.

"Reducing Cervical Cancer in Appalachia In response to RFA ES-02-009, a multi-disciplinary group of investigators from the Ohio State University and the University of Michigan have collaborated to propose a Center for Population Health and Health Disparities focusing on an important health issue in underserved populations,cancer. The Center will initially focus on the goal of understanding why high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are observed in Appalachia Ohio, a mainly rural area in Southern and Eastern Ohio. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research within the framework of the Social Determinants of Health model in three inter-related projects and four supporting cores. All studies will be conducted in 16 clinics which represent the general population of women aged 18 and older in the region. We will utilize the Center's internal and external advisory committees and community partners organized into a community advisory board and Consortium of communityorganizations to facilitate the accomplishment of project goals. Project 1 will recruit 1600 women to an observational study to  investigate multi-level (social, environmental, behavioral, and biological) correlates of ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization, in Phase I. From this cohort of women, those who smoke (30%) will be eligible to participate in Project 2, which tests the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote smoking cessation (behavioral) and validate cessation endpoints with saliva cotinine measurements (biological) in a quasi-experimental trial design; those women who are in need of & Pap test (48% of 1600) will be eligible to participate in Phase II of Project 1 which will test the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization (behavioral) and follow-up for abnormalities (biological) detected in a quasi-experimental trial design. Project 3 will examine the contribution of HPV (biological) to cervical abnormalities in Appalachia in relation to individual-level behaviors (e.g. smoking, sexual activity) within the social and environmental region of Appalachia in a case-control observational study among women who have Pap smears in these 16 clinics.The research will be supported by four cores: A) Administration - fiscal and Center oversight; B) Biostatistics and Data Resources - sample selection, data management, data analysis, and population data resources; C) Clinical Correlative Sciences - collect, obtain and process biomarker specimens; and D) Behavioral Assessment and Intervention - train interviewers and lay health educators, conduct interviews, design intervention material, and facilitate  communication amongst sites. The Center includes a mechanism for pilot project solicitation, review and funding. This Center has institutional commitment in terms of personnel, funds and space, as well as, a commitment to focus on the problem of health disparities in the region. Finally, members of the team have worked together in the past in various settings that focus on the goals of the proposed Center and have an established relationship in Appalachian Ohio for the purpose of improving the health of the population. Future work of this Center will focus on moving this type of multi-level observational and interventional community-based research, into other areas where health disparities exist in relation to cancer withinour region. Cervical cancer disparities exist among women in Appalachia. Our previous work has found that the prevalence of factors known to cause cervical cancer e.g. tobacco use, genetic predisposition, HPV infection, and stress due to economic conditions, are disproportionately higher in this population.

"Salud es Vida: Reducing Access Barriers to Cervical Cancer Screening Among Unders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has highlighted the higher incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of cervical cancer among Hispanic women (Latinas) compared to non-Hispanic whites in the US. Effective community-based interventions are needed to address these health disparities, but the development of such interventions are limited by gaps in our understanding of: 1) cultural beliefs toward cervical cancer and HPV; and 2) effective intervention programs targeting specific priority populations, such as Latina farmworkers. The overall objective of this application is to develop an effective, culturally appropriate cervical cancer prevention intervention for low-income, Mexican farmworkers in southeast Georgia. The central hypothesis is that a multi-component intervention delivered by a trained, bilingual health educator targeted to low-income, Latina farmworkers will be more effective in increasing cervical cancer screening when compared to a media-only control condition. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that interventions using trained health educators are a culturally appropriate, effective strategy for increasing cervical cancer screening in rural Latina populations. The two specific aims are to: (1) develop a multi-component health educator intervention, which is informed by ethnographic research on knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and risk perceptions for cervical cancer and HPV, and screening behaviors among low-income, Mexican farmworker women; and (2) assess the relative efficacy of the multi-component health educator intervention for increasing the rate of cervical cancer screening among Mexican farmworker women who are non-users of cervical cancer screening when compared to a control condition. The contribution of the proposed research is expected to be the development of an effective and innovative multi-component intervention, which will consist of health-educator-led small group education sessions using an animated video and a flipchart, to increase cervical cancer screening among rural, Latina immigrants. The proposed research is innovative because a new multi-component intervention program will be developed and delivered by a health educator and targeted to a new immigrant Latino farmworker population in rural, underserved southern Georgia. A better understanding of knowledge, risk perceptions, and cultural attitudes among various Hispanic subgroups around cervical cancer will assist in developing more effective outreach efforts and impacting cervical cancer disparities in groups suffering the greatest burden of the disease, thereby improving public health. The proposed study will develop an effective, culturally appropriate intervention using a health educator and lay health advisors to increase cervical cancer screening among low-income, Mexican farmworkers in southeast Georgia.",Salud es Vida: Reducing Access Barriers to Cervical Cancer Screening Among Unders,8720179,R21CA163159,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Censuses ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Language ', ' Minor ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Rural Population ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' Urban Population ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Gynecologist ', ' Mexican ', ' Rural ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' General farm worker NOS ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' risk perception ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Health Educators ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' stem ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' effective intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,GEORGIA SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,48490,0.26257838964981456
"South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION: South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities. The objective of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities (SUCCESS) is to establish a regional center addressing the unequal burden of cervical cancer in Miami Dade-County. SUCCESS will build on Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) relationships which we have established with Haitians in the city of Miami and Hispanics in the city of Hialeah. We will also partner with a 3rd multi ethnic less urban community located in the southern unincorporated Miami-Dade. Recognizing this as a very medically underserved area, our community partners selected this as our 3rd site. Our multiple PI leadership  team includes two investigators from the University of Miami's (UM) Departments of Medicine and   Epidemiology, both members of the UM Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. The third PI directs a large network of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). In partnership with three local FQHCs,  SUCCESS will to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment. Building on these findings and existing community partnerships we will conduct cancer outreach tailored to the unique needs of each community. Our major research project is a randomized study among 600 women in our three communities who have not been adequately screened for cervical cancer. At each site, one third of the women would be exposed to standard NCI approved outreach interventions and a second group will receive a comprehensive home based CHW intervention encouraging women to have Pap Smear testing at one of the three FQHCs. While CHWs are a promising approach, many women exposed to this intervention remain unscreened. Thus we propose a third approach in which women at each site receive the CHW intervention but also have the option of screening through HPV testing done via home based self-sampling. Our experience in Little Haiti is that by coupling this innovative molecular technology with a CHW led culturally tailored approach nearly all women agree to be screened. The SUCCESS pilot project will be led by one of our minority junior faculty. Through a pre-post test design, she will examine the impact of a CHW led educational curriculum that has been specifically tailored women who are HIV positive. Lastly, our training core will develop formal seminars in health disparities research and CBPR for twelve clinical fellows and post-doctoral trainees and provide a more intensive longitudinal practicum and mentorship on community-based participatory research to four early stage investigators including a preparing a CBPR grant proposal.          The vision of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities.(SUCCESS) is that through increased cervical cancer screening we could eliminate cervical cancer health disparities in our local community. To do so, SUCCESS will utilize the Community Based Participatory Research approach to reduce disparities through a combination of outreach, research and training.

"An HPV Health Communication Randomized Controlled Trial Intervention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Sherrie Wallington, PhD, MA, Assistant Professor of Oncology;, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC), Georgetown University (GUMC) Medical Center, Washington, DC. Dr. Wallington's chief academic and research goal is to transition to independence as a social and behavioral scientist investigating the role of health communication to address cancer health disparities.  Environment: Georgetown University's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center is a high-quality research environment and is well suited for the success of Dr. Wallington's career development experience, proposed research, and her transition to an independent scientist. In the event of an award, the institution is committed to ensuring that Dr. Wallington fulfills all the requirement of this award, as detailed in the Director's letter (see Institutional Environment component of this proposal).  Research: This proposed research emphasizes the need to increase knowledge of the human papillomavirus (HPV) and the HPV vaccine among low-income African-American mothers, a population that lacks HPV knowledge and has a high incidence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is estimated to be the most common sexually transmitted infection. High-risk HPV types can cause cervical, anal, and other genital cancers. However, public awareness and understanding of the sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses and the available HPV vaccine are low, particularly among racial ethnic minorities and women of low socioeconomic status. In the District of Columbia (DC), legislation passed in 2007 mandates that all female students enrolling in the sixth grade at a DC school must received the HPV vaccine or not received the HPV vaccine because of an opt-out clause. Many DC parents and community groups have questioned the efficacy of the vaccine, the clarity of the current opt-out form, and the failure of DC to provide a visible HPV public information campaign. DC has the highest cervical cancer rates in the United States. This lack of HPV education is leading to significant knowledge gaps and communication inequalities, particularly among minority and underserved populations, in the access to information and the inability of parents to make informed decisions with balanced and accurate information. To achieve a significant effect on combating cervical cancer, eliminating HPV knowledge gaps is essential. One strategy is to first educate mothers. Thus, this study seeks to develop a health communication randomized controlled HPV educational intervention in DC that targets African-American mothers who have unvaccinated daughters between the ages of 9 and 17. Participants will be randomized into one of two arms, a group intervention arm or a wait-listed control group arm. The specific aims and hypotheses to be tested are: Aim 1: To conduct a randomized controlled trial health communication intervention to increase knowledge awareness about HPV and the HPV vaccine among low socioeconomic status African-American mothers. H1: African-American mothers receiving the group educational intervention will have greater HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge awareness compared to the wait-listed control group; and Aim 2: To assess the factors associated with mothers acceptability or non-acceptability of the HPV vaccine for their daughters.

"South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION: South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities. The objective of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities (SUCCESS) is to establish a regional center addressing the unequal burden of cervical cancer in Miami Dade-County. SUCCESS will build on Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) relationships which we have established with Haitians in the city of Miami and Hispanics in the city of Hialeah. We will also partner with a 3rd multi ethnic less urban community located in the southern unincorporated Miami-Dade. Recognizing this as a very medically underserved area, our community partners selected this as our 3rd site. Our multiple PI leadership  team includes two investigators from the University of Miami's (UM) Departments of Medicine and   Epidemiology, both members of the UM Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. The third PI directs a large network of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). In partnership with three local FQHCs,  SUCCESS will to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment. Building on these findings and existing community partnerships we will conduct cancer outreach tailored to the unique needs of each community. Our major research project is a randomized study among 600 women in our three communities who have not been adequately screened for cervical cancer. At each site, one third of the women would be exposed to standard NCI approved outreach interventions and a second group will receive a comprehensive home based CHW intervention encouraging women to have Pap Smear testing at one of the three FQHCs. While CHWs are a promising approach, many women exposed to this intervention remain unscreened. Thus we propose a third approach in which women at each site receive the CHW intervention but also have the option of screening through HPV testing done via home based self-sampling. Our experience in Little Haiti is that by coupling this innovative molecular technology with a CHW led culturally tailored approach nearly all women agree to be screened. The SUCCESS pilot project will be led by one of our minority junior faculty. Through a pre-post test design, she will examine the impact of a CHW led educational curriculum that has been specifically tailored women who are HIV positive. Lastly, our training core will develop formal seminars in health disparities research and CBPR for twelve clinical fellows and post-doctoral trainees and provide a more intensive longitudinal practicum and mentorship on community-based participatory research to four early stage investigators including a preparing a CBPR grant proposal.          The vision of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities.(SUCCESS) is that through increased cervical cancer screening we could eliminate cervical cancer health disparities in our local community. To do so, SUCCESS will utilize the Community Based Participatory Research approach to reduce disparities through a combination of outreach, research and training.

"Exploring Sociodemographic and Behavioral Factors Underlying Racial/Ethnic Dispar     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Through my doctoral and post-doctoral training, I have a broad background in cancer epidemiology, with specific training and expertise in nutrition. As a doctoral student at Yale University, I analyzed data from a large multicenter case-control study of esophageal and gastric cancers. As part of this study, I examined dietary and lifestyle risk factors, including the use of novel statistical approaches such as principle components analysis and classification and regression tree analysis. During my time at Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM), I analyzed data from the National Breast Screening Study (NBSS) where I examined the roles of various lifestyle and medical risk factors for numerous cancer outcomes. As a result of these experiences, I am aware of the importance of developing and maintaining successful collaborations through frequent communication among project members and of constructing a realistic research plan and timeline. My past training has provided me with the initial tools to conduct epidemiologic studies and led to my deep interest in racial/ethnic disparities in cancer outcomes. However, I lack the breadth of knowledge in three areas (Social Epidemiology, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Spatial Analyses) necessary to conduct and lead multidisciplinary studies of cancer prevention behaviors and cancer disparities. Further, due to lack of research mentoring opportunities at my current institution, an my heavy teaching load, my development as an independent researcher in this area has been limited.             To accomplish my career goal of becoming an independent investigator, and a recognized expert in the disparities in cancer outcomes, I am proposing a career development plan in which I will expand my training through coursework in social epidemiology, health disparities, and spatial analysis as well as through guided readings, regular meetings with mentors and consultants, center visits, and attendance at selected seminars, and conferences. I will be working with an outstanding mentoring team, including Drs. Demissie and Bandera (both at UMDNJ) and Dr. Jones (Yale University), all of whom are experts in the field of cancer prevention and control and health disparities and who have extensive experience mentoring masters and doctoral level students and junior faculty. The Department of Epidemiology at UMDNJ engages in a number of epidemiology activities, courses, and seminars, (www.umdnj.edu) including activities at the School of Public Health, the Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities (IEHD), and the Cancer Institute of New Jersey. Dr. Demissie, as Director of IEHD, and Dr. Bandera's work with CINJ, will also provide great opportunities for intellectual interactions and future collaborations with both of these institutes. In addition, we have identified a number of consultants, including Dr. Yu, who is at my home institution, who will provide training and assistance in GIS, Dr. Palmer who will provide assistance in recruiting participants from SNAP-Ed and EFNEP, Dr. Dubin who will provide expertise and assistance in statistical methodology and Drs. Natale-Periera and Echeverria who will provide expertise in health disparities and social epidemiology. During the entire period of the award, my department chair and college Dean, have agreed to provide substantial support to devote at least 9 person months (75% full-time professional effort) to develop my research program, which includes limiting my teaching load, supporting my salary that goes above and beyond the $100,000 cap for K awards, reducing my responsibility to represent the Department in College and University committees, and providing me with necessary resources including, office space, secretarial support, graduate student support, and access to computer support and library services.             The proposed K01 Career Development Award will also allow the development of an epidemiologic research program in Cancer Disparities in New Jersey. Breast and cervical cancer are leading causes of cancer for women in the United States, respectively and racial/ethnic disparities in diagnosis and mortality are well noted in the literature. These disparities are explained, in part, by unequal access to cancer screening across socioeconomic and racial groups, however little is known about the impact of perception of access to cancer screening on cancer screening behaviors. This study will assess the association between race/ethnicity, perceived access to screening, and individual-level socioeconomic (SES) and demographic factors and area-level characteristics, including SES, availability of low- or no-cost cervical cancer screening and mammography, on screening behavior using a cross-sectional study of low-income women enrolled in the New Jersey Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - Education (SNAP-Ed) or Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Programs (EFNEP). Multivariate models will examine the individual and joint effects of geographic and perceived access on adherence to breast and cervical cancer screening guidelines, after adjusting for individual- and area-level characteristics. These findings will serve to examine the complex interaction between socioeconomic status and health behaviors, how they differ between non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White and Hispanics, in New Jersey, which has one of the highest cancer rates in the nation. This project will also serve to develop preliminary data to support an R01 application proposing to conduct a larger scale study, and possibly, an intervention to address these issues in this community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These findings will add to literature exploring the complex interaction between individual- and area-level measures of access to cancer screening and screening behaviors among low-income women, and how they differ between non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, and Hispanic populations in New Jersey.            ",Exploring Sociodemographic and

"Salud es Vida: Reducing Access Barriers to Cervical Cancer Screening Among Unders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has highlighted the higher incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of cervical cancer among Hispanic women (Latinas) compared to non-Hispanic whites in the US. Effective community-based interventions are needed to address these health disparities, but the development of such interventions are limited by gaps in our understanding of: 1) cultural beliefs toward cervical cancer and HPV; and 2) effective intervention programs targeting specific priority populations, such as Latina farmworkers. The overall objective of this application is to develop an effective, culturally appropriate cervical cancer prevention intervention for low-income, Mexican farmworkers in southeast Georgia. The central hypothesis is that a multi-component intervention delivered by a trained, bilingual health educator targeted to low-income, Latina farmworkers will be more effective in increasing cervical cancer screening when compared to a media-only control condition. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that interventions using trained health educators are a culturally appropriate, effective strategy for increasing cervical cancer screening in rural Latina populations. The two specific aims are to: (1) develop a multi-component health educator intervention, which is informed by ethnographic research on knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and risk perceptions for cervical cancer and HPV, and screening behaviors among low-income, Mexican farmworker women; and (2) assess the relative efficacy of the multi-component health educator intervention for increasing the rate of cervical cancer screening among Mexican farmworker women who are non-users of cervical cancer screening when compared to a control condition. The contribution of the proposed research is expected to be the development of an effective and innovative multi-component intervention, which will consist of health-educator-led small group education sessions using an animated video and a flipchart, to increase cervical cancer screening among rural, Latina immigrants. The proposed research is innovative because a new multi-component intervention program will be developed and delivered by a health educator and targeted to a new immigrant Latino farmworker population in rural, underserved southern Georgia.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A better understanding of knowledge, risk perceptions, and cultural attitudes among various Hispanic subgroups around cervical cancer will assist in developing more effective outreach efforts and impacting cervical cancer disparities in groups suffering the greatest burden of the disease, thereby improving public health. The proposed study will develop an effective, culturally appropriate intervention using a health educator and lay health advisors to increase cervical cancer screening among low-income, Mexican farmworkers in southeast Georgia.         ",Salud es Vida: Reducing Access Barriers to Cervical Cancer Screening Among Unders,8549167,R21CA163159,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Censuses ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Language ', ' Minor ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Rural Population ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' Urban Population ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Gynecologist ', ' Mexican ', ' Rural ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' General farm worker NOS ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' risk perception ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Health Educators ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' stem ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,GEORGIA SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,107132,0.26257838964981456
"A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among Pacific Islander Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among PI Women ABSTRACT Despite the fact that cervical cancer is one of the most preventable of cancers, it remains one of the top five causes of cancer deaths in the U.S. and in California. The Pap test has been shown to be effective in not only detecting cancer but also precancerous cells. Even with the introduction of HPV testing and vaccines, Pap tests represent an important cervical cancer prevention and early detection method for women in this country. Unfortunately, the Pap test is severely underutilized among many ethnic and racial populations, including Pacific Islanders (PIs) who have high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality data among specific PI ethnic groups is sparse, with available information underscoring significant cancer health disparities. In California as in the Pacific, cervical cancer is one of the top five causes of cancer deaths. Given the dearth of PI researchers and studies at the NIH level, community-based participatory research (CBPR) holds the potential for engaging community cultural experts alongside cancer health disparities researchers to address their pressing cervical cancer detection needs. This five year cluster unit randomized trial will develop and evaluate a social support intervention targeting both men and women to increase Pap testing decision making and behavior among Chamorro, Samoan and Tongan women age 18-65 years old in Southern California. We aim to: 1. Apply CBPR principles and processes for community/university partners throughout the grant period; 2. Develop and pretest two gender-specific and culturally tailored educational interventions for PI women and men. The interventions will be conducted separately by gender, and will employ a video, flipchart, and brochure, along with small-group discussions facilitated by gender-matched community health educators; 3. Develop and validate instruments measuring men's social support (provided), women's social support (perceived) and women's decision making utility; 4. Recruit and randomly assign community-based organizational samples and recruit and follow the cohorts of PI females and males in the intervention and control groups 5. Examine the associations that test the conceptual model regarding social support, decision making utility, and Pap testing intentions and behaviors; 6. Follow the cohort of PI women and men in the intervention vs. control groups to assess the impact of the intervention. Using a longitudinal cohort design, we will identify, recruit, and randomly assign PI members of churches and other community-based organizations to one of two intervention options: a) a culturally tailored social support intervention group for women and men consisting of community health educator-facilitated video, flipchart and brochure; or b) a usual care control group, consisting of pre-existing cancer education materials (brochures) for PI women and men delivered by community health educators. We posit that the planned social support intervention will increase men's provision, and women's perceptions, of Pap testing social support, leading to increases in women's prioritization of Pap testing decision making utility and Pap testing behaviors. The proposed study team involves long-standing university and community collaborators, and uses a multiple PI model to institutionalize shared participation and leadership structures. The community side of this CBPR study includes three CBOs with years of experience in health promotion, disease prevention, and collaborative research for their respective PI populations. The university side includes experienced behavioral scientists in CBPR, cancer control and decision making with multiethnic populations. This study will add to the existing science of cancer health disparities by adapting and applying well-established behavioral theories to understand the ways in which collectivist-oriented interventions influence individual women's cancer screening behavioral changes. Furthermore, this study will illuminate the CBPR engagement aspects necessary to conduct rigorous intervention research in small-size populations. The product of this study will be a culturally-tailored intervention that holds the potential to become a model for other collectivistic populations. Strengths of this study include: i) a focus on a major cancer health disparity; ii) development and testing of methods that are applicable to other health disparities; iii) a theoretical focus on decision making (a priority area for NCI regarding translational research); iv) an intervention approach that investigates and develops new strategies to improve cultural tailoring and evaluation; v) a focus on men; and vi) an ethnically diverse team of community and university investigators with an established track record in CBPR research. Pacific Islanders (PIs) experience some of the highest cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in the U.S., yet little research exists on the ways to address and ameliorate their cancer health disparities. This five year randomized community-based participatory research study will develop and test a social support intervention targeting both PI men and women to increase women's Pap testing among three populations in Southern California: Chamorros, Tongans and Samoans. This study will add to the existing science of cancer health disparities by adapting and applying well-established behavioral theories to understand the ways in which collectivistic-oriented interventions influence individual women's cancer screening decision making and behaviors.

"Feasibility of Virtual Agent Cervical Cancer Education for Hispanic Farmworkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinas experience higher cervical cancer (CC) incidence and mortality when compared to the general population in the United States. Many Latinas lack access to health care and experience literacy, communication, and knowledge barriers that prevent them from obtaining CC screening. Patient navigator (PN) and other similar interventions have been implemented to increase CC screening rates; however, few have focused directly on the needs of Latinas. Interactive technological interventions, like embodied conversational agents (ECA), are currently used in other populations, settings, and for other health topics, but no known initiative has used culturally and literacy appropriate technology to deliver Spanish-language CC education as part of a PN intervention. This study aims to create and conduct a preliminary evaluation of a Spanish-language Virtual Patient Educator (VPE) multimedia application to augment a PN intervention for increasing CC screening rates among Latinas in a rural agricultural community. Using the Social Cognitive Theory, the proposed project will be conducted in 2 phases. In Phase 1, the research team will engage community members to develop a low literacy Spanish-language interactive multimedia application consisting of an ECA. Using theoretical principles and drawing from our formative research, the project team will design the VPE through systematic and technical processes. Ongoing feedback (usability testing) from members of the intended audience will be carried out to ensure that patients (users) can perform intended system tasks efficiently, effectively, and satisfactoril. Once usability testing is complete, a series of learner verification interviews will be conducted t assess initial suitability of the VPE. Since the VPE will be the first known Spanish-language ECA used to augment a PN intervention, it is important to see whether patients accept the VPE and whether it is feasible to conduct a study of patient navigation augmented by the VPE. In Phase 2, a preliminary evaluation of 2 methods of patient navigation delivery (with and without VPE) will be conducted with 60 participants who are not up to date with recommended CC screening according to American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians' guidelines. Cluster randomization will be used to randomize patients to 1 of 2 PN intervention conditions: (1) PN; or (2) PN plus VPE (PN+VPE) using date of clinic as unit of randomization. The preliminary evaluation will examine the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, data collection, and acceptability of VPE application. Exploratory data will also be collected regarding the potential impact of PN+VPE on behavioral capacity and self-efficacy for obtaining CC screening, Pap test adherence, and satisfaction with care. The proposed project will advance our research towards the development of interactive technology interventions to disseminate health education to disparate populations.          Latinas experience higher cervical cancer incidence and mortality when compared to the general population in the United States. The proposed study is the first to develop interactive technology to augment a patient navigation intervention by providing patient education about human papillomavirus, cervical cancer, and the importance of regular cervical cancer screening. A patient navigation intervention augmented by interactive educational technology is expected to enhance and extend access to health information and health care for Spanish-speaking Latinas living in a rural agricultural community.

"Comparative and Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing HPV-Related Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, more than 25,000 cases of invasive cancer attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection occur in the United States; nearly 50% are cervical cancer, while the rest involve the oral cavity/oropharynx, anus, vulva, penis, and vagina. Collectively, these account for substantial morbidity and mortality, contribute to health disparities, and are associated with high economic costs. Advancements in HPV-related cancer epidemiology, coupled with new (e.g., HPV-16,-18 vaccines, HPV DNA testing) and emerging (e.g., biomarkers, therapeutic vaccines) technologies provide a remarkable opportunity to improve cancer prevention efforts. However, critical challenges remain with respect to clinical decision-making and prevention policy, pertaining to knowledge gaps and heterogeneities in the natural history of different cancers, uncertainties in HPV type distribution following HPV-16,-18 vaccination, and the real-world clinical effectiveness of emerging technologies. We propose to employ a decision-analytic approach, developing a flexible modeling framework that will allow us to synthesize the best available data; evaluate the health and economic consequences of alternative strategies; explore the uncertainty around their outcomes; explicitly quantify the tradeoffs associated with different approaches; and inform timely clinical and policy questions. By achieving our aims, we expect to have an impact on (1) the analytic methods of decision science; (2) the equitable distribution and rationale use of new technology; (3) the effectiveness of strategies for cancer prevention through clinical guidelines and national policies; (4) HPV-related cancer outcomes, including reduced incidence, enhanced quality of life, improved survival, and reduced disparities; and (5) the financial and economic profile of delivering cancer-related health services.        Rapid advances in the fields of HPV-related cancer epidemiology and medical technology present opportunities to revolutionize the approach to cancer prevention in the U.S. but have outpaced the ability of policy makers to make informed decisions regarding optimal adoption of health interventions. In this project, we propose to develop a flexible modeling framework that will enable us to synthesize the best available data on HPV, provide insight into the comparative and cost-effectiveness of different strategies, and assist in informed public health and clinical decision-making with respect to prevention of HPV-related cancers.

"Disparities in HPV vaccine completion: Identifying and quantifying the barriers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common sexually transmitted infection in the US, is an established necessary cause of cervical cancer. It is well documented that black, Hispanic and low-income women have persistently higher rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality compared to white and higher income women. The recent licensure of two highly efficacious vaccines against HPV signals an important opportunity to reduce these disparities. These vaccines are currently recommended for adolescents' ages 11-12 years, with catch-up vaccination to age 26 years for females and 21 years for males, in a 3-dose regimen over a 6 month period. Reducing disparities in cervical cancer depends on adequate vaccine uptake by those at greatest risk. Currently, many adolescents fail to receive all 3 doses. Even more troubling are strong and persistent disparities in completion: among females who receive at least 1 dose, black, Hispanic, and low- income individuals are significantly less likely to receive all 3 doses. Therefore, evidence-based and culturally relevant interventions are urgently needed to increase adherence to the recommended regimen. However, we currently have an insufficient understanding of the barriers to completion for these vulnerable populations. Therefore, we propose an exploratory and developmental study that will utilize a sequential mixed methods approach to identify and quantify barriers to HPV vaccination. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) identify and describe barriers to HPV vaccination completion among lower-income racial and ethnic minorities; (2) estimate the prevalence and strength of barriers and examine associations with race, ethnic identity, and socioeconomic status; (3) generate ideas for future interventions that will be culturally relevant and have the greatest potential for impact. Using Ecological Systems Theory as a framework, we will determine barriers at the individual, organizational, and community levels. We will conduct this study at an urban primary care center that serves a predominantly racial/ethnic minority and low-income population. Qualitative in-depth interviews with parents of adolescents will be conducted to identify possible barriers, adapt the conceptual model, and inform development of a structured survey. In the quantitative phase, this survey will be administered to a sample of 200 parents of adolescents and statistical analyses will estimate the prevalence and strength of barriers and examine correlates including race, ethnic identity, and socioeconomic status. The final phase will involve interpretive qualitative interviews to validate and triangulate quantitative findings. These conclusions will be used to develop interventions that have the greatest potential for impact by determining the most salient barriers to completion and strategies for overcoming these barriers. This proposed work is essential for providing the knowledge necessary to translate empirical findings about high HPV vaccine efficacy into improved women's health through evidence-based interventions to increase vaccination coverage for populations at greatest risk for the consequences of HPV infection.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary cause of cervical cancer that disproportionately affects black, Hispanic, and low-income women; these same populations are also the least likely to complete the 3-dose HPV vaccine regimen. Because barriers to completion are unknown, the purpose of this project is to understand reasons for the disparity in adequate uptake of HPV vaccine. Results of this study will be used to plan for future interventions that are culturally relevant and have the greatest potential for reducing disparities in cervical cancer by race, ethnicity, and income.            ",Disparities in HPV vaccine completion: Identifying and quantifying the barriers,8411362,R21CA163160,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunization ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Interview ', ' Licensure ', ' Literature ', ' Low Income Population ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Parents ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Solutions ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' uptake ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Visit ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Healthcare Visit ', ' Health Care Visit ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Cognitive ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' trend ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' vaccine efficacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Cervical cancer vaccine ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' FDA approved ', ' routine care ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,189714,0.22348713404359533
"HPV Methylation as a Biomarker of Viral Persistence and Risk of Cervical Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The estimated prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection for women in the U.S. is over 10 million, with approximately 6.2 million new infections annually, yet most HPV infections are transient and clear within 24 months. About 12,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported annually in the U.S., and only women with persistent high-risk HPV infection are at risk of dysplasia (CIN) that ultimately progresses to cervical cancer. It is unknown why HPV infections clear in most women yet persist in others. The current false positive rate of pap test screening (~1 in 10 are ""abnormal""), results in follow up colposcopy and biopsy that are financially and emotionally costly. Thus, there is a great clinical need to identify biomarkers that are predictive of the small number of high-risk HPV infections that will persist and progress, so that medical resources can be directed at the women truly at risk of cervical disease. Methylation of viral DNA sequences (especially in the L1 and L2 ORF) as a host defense mechanism is gaining attention. The process of methylation depends on dietary folate and the demethylation depends on base excision repair (BER) to restore native cytosine in CpG sequences. Rarely have studies prospectively followed women over time with the specific goal of measuring viral persistence. We have available for the proposed study samples of DNA collected from a unique cohort called the Carolina Women's Care Study (CWCS) supported by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (P20 MD001770). The study was initiated to identify biomarkers of HPV persistence in college-age women. DNA isolated from exfoliated cervical cells collected longitudinally in the CWCS will allow us to uncover candidate biomarkers based on the following hypothesis. Alterations in the methylation of HPV DNA ultimately determine viral persistence or clearance, and epigenetic methylation of HPV sequences is controlled by folate metabolism and/or DNA repair processes. Accordingly, polymorphisms in genes involved in folate metabolism and/or base excision repair will serve as excellent biomarkers for HPV persistence, and thus, risk ultimately for cervical cancer. Aim 1 will determine the methylation status of the viral L1 and L2 genes in exfoliated cervical cells collected as part of the CWCS, which followed college age women prospectively for up to four years and identified participants who rapidly cleared the HPV viral infection along with others who had persistent HPV infections. Aim 2 will determine the prevalence of polymorphisms (SNPs) in folate metabolizing enzymes and DNA repair enzymes in the CWCS cohort and will correlate specific SNPs with the levels of high- risk HPV DNA methylation, viral persistence, and viral clearance. The clinical and translational impact of this study will be to identify genetic interactions between methylation of HPV, folate metabolizing enzymes and DNA repair enzymes that will serve as biomarkers for HPV persistence, and thus, risk for cervical cancer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cervical cancer, caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, affects 12,000 women annually in the U.S., yet cervical cancer is a rare outcome of HPV infection, which is estimated to be greater than 10 million. Moreover, Pap test screening produces approximately 1 in 10 abnormal tests that require costly and emotionally taxing follow ups that often show no evidence of disease. This project will discover new biomarkers that can predict which HPV infections are most likely to lead to cervical cancer, thus greatly reducing the economic and psychological burden associated with the current system of testing.            ",HPV Methylation as a Biomarker of Viral Persistence and Risk of Cervical Disease,8507444,R21CA169998,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Attention ', ' Biopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Colposcopy ', ' Cytology ', ' 2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino- ', ' Cytosine ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Site-Specific DNA-methyltransferase ', ' Modification Methylases ', ' EC 2.1.1.113 ', ' Dnmt ', ' DNA-Methyltransferases ', ' DNA Modification Methyltransferases ', ' DNA Modification Methylases ', ' Unscheduled DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA Damage Repair ', ' DNA Repair ', ' virus DNA ', ' viral DNA ', ' Economics ', ' Enzymes ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Infection ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mammalia ', ' Mammals ', ' L-Methionine ', ' L-Isomer Methionine ', ' Methionine ', ' Protein Methylation ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Reading ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' South Carolina ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' tetrahydropteroylglutamate ', ' tetrahydrofolic acid ', ' 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid ', ' Tetrahydrofolates ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Woman ', ' Benzoic acid, 4-(((5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)amino)carbonyl)- ', ' Am80 ', ' Am 80 ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' Measures ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' ORFs ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' Caring ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Folate ', ' Procedures ', ' Cervical ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Uterine Cervix Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Cervix Uteri Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Cervix Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasms ', ' Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Genetic ', ' dyscrasia ', ' Dysplasia ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' experience ', ' methyl group ', ' demethylation ', ' repair endonuclease ', ' repair enzyme ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Folic Acid Metabolosm ', ' Folate Metabolism ', ' folic acid metabolism ', ' DNA Base Excision Repair ', ' Base Excision Repairs ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' DNA Repair Enzymes ', ' DNA Methyltransferase ', ' Host Defense Mechanism ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Collecting Cell ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' No Evidence of Disease ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' High risk Human papilloma virus ', ' High risk Human Papillomavirus ', ' High risk HPV ', ' High Risk Oncogenic HPV ', ' HPV-High Risk ', ' minority health ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R21,2013,186567,0.23478358492350654
"Mother-Daughter Joint Decision Making to Obtain the HPV Vaccine     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a precursor of cervical cancer and genital warts. HPV strains, 16 and 18, are recognized as precursors of 70% of cervical cancers. HPV strains, 6 and 11, are associated with 90% of genital warts. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed a vaccine to protect against these four HPV types. Recent estimates indicate that only 18% of teenage girls have received the three-dose series in the U.S. Cervical cancer affects ethnic minorities disproportionately. Cervical cancer incidence is two to fourfold in Latina women when compared to non-Latina white women. Research also suggests that the prevalence of HPV is greater in ethnic minority women.  Our inquiry will be guided by a combination of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model of preventive behavior (Fisher & Fisher, 1992; Fisher, Fisher, & Shuper, 2009) and cultural factors. Our proposed investigation will consist of three studies conducted in sequence: two qualitative and one quantitative. Qualitative study 1 will consist of semi-structured interview conducted separately with 30 mothers and 30 non-vaccinated daughters. The purpose of qualitative study 1 will be to identify: a) format and communication source to provide information, in a future intervention, to mothers and daughters about HPV and the vaccine while considering health literacy and numeracy, b) deterrents and motivators of vaccination acceptance while considering cultural factors, and c) the skills and resources that mothers and daughters perceive they need to be self-efficacious in communicating effectively with one another regarding sexuality and the adoption of sexuality-related health preventive measures such as vaccination. The objective of qualitative study 2 will be to corroborate and expand our findings from qualitative study 1. Qualitative study 2 will consist of semi-structured interviews conducted separately with 30 mothers and 30 vaccinated daughters. The purpose of qualitative study 2 will be to elucidate: a) knowledge about HPV etiology and vaccination, b) how the decision to vaccinate was made, and c) mother and daughter level of comfort in discussing sexuality- related preventive behaviors. Lastly, the purpose of the quantitative study will be to establish that the domains pertaining to the decision to vaccinate- information, motivation, behavioral skills-predict vaccination decisions in a sample of 150 Latina mothers (50% who have vaccinated their daughters).  The findings from the proposed study will be used to pursue an R01 to develop and pilot test a future intervention to promote adoption of the HPV vaccine in the Latino community. The accomplishment of our aims will inform the development of an intervention based on well-defined underlying decision-making mechanisms critical to the adoption of a disease preventive behavior that has the potential to considerably reduce ethnic health disparities in cancer. In addition, information gathered in our studies can be translated to promote uptake of the HPV vaccine by health care practitioners impacting directly the field of nursing science.          The findings from this research will be used to inform the development of an intervention to promote vaccination in the Latino community. In addition, the findings will inform health care practitioners of the information that can be provided to Latinas, n the patient-provider encounter, to motivate vaccination.

"Kin Keeper:Reducing Disparities Through Cancer Literacy and Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of the phenomena health disparities requires researchers and public health educators to use many strategies to devise ways of reducing disparities and implement programs with the goal of eliminating those disparities. We are proposing to focus on breast and cervical cancer screening among Black, Latina, and Arab women living in the United States. This will be done by investigating the effectiveness of the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention, a female-family focused educational intervention for medically underserved women applied in a real world setting, using a randomized control trial design. The Kin KeeperSM model uses synergy and natural communication that exists among female family members to increase cancer prevention education and screening, which translates into functional cancer literacy. Simultaneously we will be using a two-step approach that also includes measuring the cost of the intervention, which is in important if the model is going to be sustained and have public utility in decreasing and ultimately eliminating cancer disparities. The goals of this research project are: 1) To determine if the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention increases first time and appropriately timed breast cancer screening rates among Black, Latina, and Arab women; 2) To determine if the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention increases first time and appropriately timed cervical cancer screening rates among Black, Latina, and Arab women; 3) To measure functional cancer literacy over time at the individual and family level and; 4) To assess costs and rates of health care utilization among women in the Kin KeeperSM model and the comparison group. By combining a community based approach with our university-community partnership as well as health services research methodology, we anticipate that we will have sustainable model to impact breast and cervical cancer disparities among medically underserved women.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this research will impact public health agencies and research on planning and intervention design; as to more effectively promote breast and cervical cancer screening and early detection for medically underserved women. This will be done by conducting our intervention outcomes research under real world conditions, partnering with public health agencies and by conducting a cost analysis.

"Disparities in cervical cancer precursors and deregulation of imprinted genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although screening for uterine cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN) and its aggressive treatment has resulted in decreased cervical cancer incidence and mortality, an estimated 11,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) and 40,000 cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS) continue to be diagnosed every year in the United States. ICC incidence is 60% higher and mortality over two times higher in African Americans compared to whites. Such disparate rates in incidence and mortality are despite comparable screening rates to detect precursor lesions, comparable prevalence of 'high risk' human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the etiologic agent, and co-factors such as cigarette smoking. Reasons for such disparities are largely unknown. A more detailed understanding of the etiology of lesions that progress will improve risk stratification to distinguish women with a low risk of progression from those likely to rapidly progress to invasive cancer. We posit that deregulation of genomically imprinted genes, a group of approximately 50 known growth-regulatory genes where only one allele is normally active, may predict progression to cervical cancer. We found that a substantial group of imprinted genes exhibit altered expression in ICC versus normal cervical epithelium. In addition, methylation analysis of two regulatory regions controlling IGF2 expression shows deviation from normal in specimens with CIN2-CIN3 classification and more profound deviation in invasive cancers. Together, these findings suggest that imprinted genes are deregulated in ICC and these features may improve detection of CIN cases likely to progress. Our central hypothesis is that deregulation at imprint regulatory elements of imprinted genes, likely influenced by environmental exposures, increases risk of progression to cervical cancer in women infected with 'high risk' HPV. We have already shown racial variation on the effect of environmental exposures on imprint deregulation, and thus, further hypothesize that higher risk in African Americans and Hispanics is due to race/ethnic differences in deregulation of these genes. Our specific aims are to: (1) determine if deregulation of imprint regulatory elements of known imprinted genes is associated with increased risk of progression of CIN1 to CIN2+, and whether this association varies by race/ethnicity; (2) determine whether aberrant methylation of imprint regulatory elements in cervical cells is similar to that found in peripheral blood cells, suggesting an early event; and associated with (i) transcriptional expression, and (ii) loss of imprinting; (3) evaluate whether deregulation of known imprinted genes in cervical cells can be used to discriminate women with CIN2+ among 500 Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance (ASCUS) cases. To address the Aims, we will recruit and follow 1,500 women with CIN1 and 500 with ASCUS, and examine the association between aberrant methylation markers at imprinted regulatory elements of 12 genes and progression from CIN1 to CIN2+. We will then test the performance of these markers to identify CIN2+ cases from among 500 ASCUS cases. Data from the proposed study will improve triage decisions and reduce disparities in ICC morbidity and mortality.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although screening for cervical intraepithelial lesions to prevent cervical cancer has resulted in decreased cancer incidence and mortality, an estimated 11,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer and 40,000 carcinomas in situ cases continue to be diagnosed every year in the United States with incidence 60% higher and mortality >2-times higher in African Americans compared to whites. We will recruit and follow 1,500 CIN1 and 500 cases of Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance (ASCUS), and examine the association between aberrant methylation at imprinted regulatory elements of 12 genes and progression to CIN2 or worse and then test the performance of these markers in ASCUS cases, independent of known co-factors. Data from this study will elucidate the role of epigenetic deregulation in CIN2+ and inform triage decisions, reducing disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality.

"A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among Pacific Islander Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among PI Women ABSTRACT Despite the fact that cervical cancer is one of the most preventable of cancers, it remains one of the top five causes of cancer deaths in the U.S. and in California. The Pap test has been shown to be effective in not only detecting cancer but also precancerous cells. Even with the introduction of HPV testing and vaccines, Pap tests represent an important cervical cancer prevention and early detection method for women in this country. Unfortunately, the Pap test is severely underutilized among many ethnic and racial populations, including Pacific Islanders (PIs) who have high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality data among specific PI ethnic groups is sparse, with available information underscoring significant cancer health disparities. In California as in the Pacific, cervical cancer is one of the top five causes of cancer deaths. Given the dearth of PI researchers and studies at the NIH level, community-based participatory research (CBPR) holds the potential for engaging community cultural experts alongside cancer health disparities researchers to address their pressing cervical cancer detection needs. This five year cluster unit randomized trial will develop and evaluate a social support intervention targeting both men and women to increase Pap testing decision making and behavior among Chamorro, Samoan and Tongan women age 18-65 years old in Southern California. We aim to: 1. Apply CBPR principles and processes for community/university partners throughout the grant period; 2. Develop and pretest two gender-specific and culturally tailored educational interventions for PI women and men. The interventions will be conducted separately by gender, and will employ a video, flipchart, and brochure, along with small-group discussions facilitated by gender-matched community health educators; 3. Develop and validate instruments measuring men's social support (provided), women's social support (perceived) and women's decision making utility; 4. Recruit and randomly assign community-based organizational samples and recruit and follow the cohorts of PI females and males in the intervention and control groups 5. Examine the associations that test the conceptual model regarding social support, decision making utility, and Pap testing intentions and behaviors; 6. Follow the cohort of PI women and men in the intervention vs. control groups to assess the impact of the intervention. Using a longitudinal cohort design, we will identify, recruit, and randomly assign PI members of churches and other community-based organizations to one of two intervention options: a) a culturally tailored social support intervention group for women and men consisting of community health educator-facilitated video, flipchart and brochure; or b) a usual care control group, consisting of pre-existing cancer education materials (brochures) for PI women and men delivered by community health educators. We posit that the planned social support intervention will increase men's provision, and women's perceptions, of Pap testing social support, leading to increases in women's prioritization of Pap testing decision making utility and Pap testing behaviors. The proposed study team involves long-standing university and community collaborators, and uses a multiple PI model to institutionalize shared participation and leadership structures. The community side of this CBPR study includes three CBOs with years of experience in health promotion, disease prevention, and collaborative research for their respective PI populations. The university side includes experienced behavioral scientists in CBPR, cancer control and decision making with multiethnic populations. This study will add to the existing science of cancer health disparities by adapting and applying well-established behavioral theories to understand the ways in which collectivist-oriented interventions influence individual women's cancer screening behavioral changes. Furthermore, this study will illuminate the CBPR engagement aspects necessary to conduct rigorous intervention research in small-size populations. The product of this study will be a culturally-tailored intervention that holds the potential to become a model for other collectivistic populations. Strengths of this study include: i) a focus on a major cancer health disparity; ii) development and testing of methods that are applicable to other health disparities; iii) a theoretical focus on decision making (a priority area for NCI regarding translational research); iv) an intervention approach that investigates and develops new strategies to improve cultural tailoring and evaluation; v) a focus on men; and vi) an ethnically diverse team of community and university investigators with an established track record in CBPR research.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among Pacific Islander Women Project Narrative Pacific Islanders (PIs) experience some of the highest cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in the U.S., yet little research exists on the ways to address and ameliorate their cancer health disparities.

"A Text Message Intervention to Increase HPV Vaccine Completion in Young Latinas  ABSTRACT  Angelica Roncancio, Ph.D. is a motivated postdoctoral fellow, trained as a behavioral scientist, who is currently working at the Center for Health Promotion and Prevention Research at the University of Texas Health Science Center Houston (UTHSC-H) School of Public Health. The overall goal of this NCI K01 career development proposal is to provide Dr. Roncancio with the additional research skills necessary to launch an independent career focused on reducing HPV-related cancer disparities among Latinas. Dr. Roncancio's research examines the psychosocial and cultural determinants of cervical-cancer screening and HPV vaccination among Latinas and seeks to modify health behavior through innovative approaches to screening and vaccination completion. Under the mentorship of Dr. Maria Fernandez she will receive specialized, mentored training in the following areas: 1) cancer disparities in Latino populations, 2) the development of theory-based interventions, and 3) the use of technology in health promotion.  UTHSC-H's rich training environment provides junior investigators with the resources necessary to become independent, productive, and highly successful researchers. For example, it provides outstanding opportunities for developing skills in grant writing, manuscript publication, and project management. UTHSC-H also offers a large variety of courses, workshops, and seminars relevant to public health and behavioral science, along with access to some of the most renowned prevention scientists in cancer research.  Dr. Roncancio's long-term career goal as an independent health researcher is to improve both cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination rates, ultimately aiding in the reduction of cervical cancer disparity in Latinas. She will develop a research program focused on the development and implementation of innovative, culturally appropriate, theory-based interventions to increase cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination among underserved Latinas.  In addition, Dr. Roncancio outlines four short term goals to be achieved throughout the award period that will serve as the foundation for an independent research career: 1) to increase her science-based knowledge in behavioral theory and its application to the development of cancer interventions for underserved populations, particularly Latinas; 2) to increase her knowledge in the use of technology in interventions targeted at hard-to- reach underserved populations; 3) to increase experience in implementing interventions in hard-to-reach populations; and 4) to participate in professional development activities related to cancer health disparities. These goals will be achieved through a combination of formal coursework and directed readings, experience in implementing several research projects, experience in developing and publishing manuscripts, and intensive mentoring to ensure that Dr. Roncancio achieves each of her specific short term goals and becomes a successful independent cervical cancer disparities researcher.  The aims of the proposed research are to: 1) develop an Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction (IM) that explains Spanish-speaking Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series, and 2) develop and pilot test an innovatively-delivered IM-based intervention (via video text messaging) for Spanish-speaking Latino mothers to encourage HPV vaccine series completion for their adolescent daughters. This research is both important and timely given the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer's 2012 recommendation to increase HPV vaccination efforts to combat the rise in incidence rates of some HPV-associated cancers and the finding that Latino adolescent girls are less likely non-Latino white adolescent girls to complete the HPV vaccine series.  The proposed aims will be accomplished through four successive plans of study: 1) a qualitative study to identify the beliefs that underlie Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series; 2) a longitudinal study to identify the associations between the IM predictor variables, intentions, and behavior; 3) a usability study to evaluate the acceptability and appropriateness of the video texts to be delivered to the mothers' cellular phones that were developed to increase HPV vaccine series completion; and 4) a longitudinal pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a theory-based intervention that uses video text messaging as an innovative channel of delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will address a significant gap in our knowledge of the factors that influence Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series and will result in the development of an innovatively-delivered, theory-based intervention that may increase vaccine completion in this population. This intervention will be the first of its kind and has the potential to increase HPV vaccine completion in an underserved population known for low completion rates and for being disproportionately affected by cervical cancer disparities.            ",A Text Message Intervention to Increase HPV Vaccine Completion in Young Latinas,8617600,K01CA181437,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Daughter ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Mothers ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Reading ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' behavior prediction ', ' experience ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Annual Reports ', ' Angelica ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Operating System ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' twelve year old ', ' age 12 years ', ' 12 year old ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' usability ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K01,2013,139462,0.19581745147568191
"Cervical, Anal & Oral HPV Persistence/Adolescent Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Adolescents and young women have the highest rates of cervical HPV, including infection with the HPV types causing significant morbidity and mortality. Introduction of the FDA-approved quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil(R), Merck & Co.) targeting HPV16 and HPV18 (high-risk [HR] types present in >65% of cervical cancers), as well as HPV6 and 11 (associated with most genital warts), has the potential to reduce the burden of genital HPV and disease. HPV vaccine clinical trials focused exclusively on low-risk women with limited numbers of sexual partners who were highly compliant with the vaccine schedule; these females were not representative of those most at risk to suffer from HPV-related disease. In fact, Hispanic and African-American women have the highest and second highest incidence rates of cervical cancer in the U.S., respectively, and high mortality rates from cervical cancer. In addition, the associations of HPV-related anal and/or oropharyngeal lesions are an important public health concern, yet few vaccine studies in women have evaluated HPV at these sites. Subsequent to the approval and release of GARDASIL, we initiated a prospective cohort study of sexually- active, inner-city, minority adolescent women attending the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center (MSAHC), the largest comprehensive adolescent primary care facility in the U.S. To date, this project has enrolled more than 750 sexually active teens between the ages of 12-19. Prevalent HPV infection at enrollment was detected in 54% of cervical, 42% of anal and 20% of oral specimens, with vaccine types (HPV 6/11, 16 & 18) present in 7%, 6% and 1% of adolescents, respectively. Adolescents who had three doses were at significantly reduced risk of HPV vaccine types in the cervix compared to those who had no vaccination. With respect to extracervical sites, non-significant reductions were observed for HR-HPV vaccine types in the anal and oral cavities when comparing fully vaccinated to non-vaccinated adolescents. There was considerable incident (4.2 per 100 person years) detection of cervical HPV 16/18 infection not present at enrollment despite vaccination; this observed rate is substantially above that reported in the efficacy trials. We propose to address the health disparities of HPV in minority young women by continuing our cohort study of high-risk adolescent females participating in an HPV immunization program at MSAHC. We propose to extend the prospective follow-up (with repeat visits every 6 months) to evaluate the long-term burden of infection and to increase sample size to just over 1,400 subjects to improve statistical power. The increased sample size and longer follow-up will allow us to determine risk factors for break-through HPV infections, as well as integrate a new aim to evaluate psychosocial elements of adolescent development and high-risk behaviors in teens. Data obtained from this study will be essential to understanding the 'real-world' impact of HPV vaccination in this group not studied in the vaccine trials and will provide the biological underpinnings for future HPV and cervical cancer screening practices, as well as estimating the potential impact of vaccine on anal and/or oropharyngeal HPV infections.          Adolescents and young women have the highest rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, including infection with the HPV types causing high-grade neoplasia, cervical and anal cancer. This study investigates the continued burden of HPV in a population of high-risk, predominantly Hispanic and African-American inner- city adolescent women not previously included in the large randomized clinical trials of the HPV vaccine. This study will provide information that is critical to the proper design of screening and preventive strategies in populations that are at the highest risk for HPV-associated diseases despite vaccination.

"Kin Keeper:Reducing Disparities Through Cancer Literacy and Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of the phenomena health disparities requires researchers and public health educators to use many strategies to devise ways of reducing disparities and implement programs with the goal of eliminating those disparities. We are proposing to focus on breast and cervical cancer screening among Black, Latina, and Arab women living in the United States. This will be done by investigating the effectiveness of the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention, a female-family focused educational intervention for medically underserved women applied in a real world setting, using a randomized control trial design. The Kin KeeperSM model uses synergy and natural communication that exists among female family members to increase cancer prevention education and screening, which translates into functional cancer literacy. Simultaneously we will be using a two-step approach that also includes measuring the cost of the intervention, which is in important if the model is going to be sustained and have public utility in decreasing and ultimately eliminating cancer disparities. The goals of this research project are: 1) To determine if the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention increases first time and appropriately timed breast cancer screening rates among Black, Latina, and Arab women; 2) To determine if the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention increases first time and appropriately timed cervical cancer screening rates among Black, Latina, and Arab women; 3) To measure functional cancer literacy over time at the individual and family level and; 4) To assess costs and rates of health care utilization among women in the Kin KeeperSM model and the comparison group. By combining a community based approach with our university-community partnership as well as health services research methodology, we anticipate that we will have sustainable model to impact breast and cervical cancer disparities among medically underserved women.        Results from this research will impact public health agencies and research on planning and intervention design; as to more effectively promote breast and cervical cancer screening and early detection for medically underserved women. This will be done by conducting our intervention outcomes research under real world conditions, partnering with public health agencies and by conducting a cost analysis.

"An HPV Health Communication Randomized Controlled Trial Intervention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Sherrie Wallington, PhD, MA, Assistant Professor of Oncology;, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC), Georgetown University (GUMC) Medical Center, Washington, DC. Dr. Wallington's chief academic and research goal is to transition to independence as a social and behavioral scientist investigating the role of health communication to address cancer health disparities.  Environment: Georgetown University's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center is a high-quality research environment and is well suited for the success of Dr. Wallington's career development experience, proposed research, and her transition to an independent scientist. In the event of an award, the institution is committed to ensuring that Dr. Wallington fulfills all the requirement of this award, as detailed in the Director's letter (see Institutional Environment component of this proposal).  Research: This proposed research emphasizes the need to increase knowledge of the human papillomavirus (HPV) and the HPV vaccine among low-income African-American mothers, a population that lacks HPV knowledge and has a high incidence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is estimated to be the most common sexually transmitted infection. High-risk HPV types can cause cervical, anal, and other genital cancers. However, public awareness and understanding of the sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses and the available HPV vaccine are low, particularly among racial ethnic minorities and women of low socioeconomic status. In the District of Columbia (DC), legislation passed in 2007 mandates that all female students enrolling in the sixth grade at a DC school must received the HPV vaccine or not received the HPV vaccine because of an opt-out clause. Many DC parents and community groups have questioned the efficacy of the vaccine, the clarity of the current opt-out form, and the failure of DC to provide a visible HPV public information campaign. DC has the highest cervical cancer rates in the United States. This lack of HPV education is leading to significant knowledge gaps and communication inequalities, particularly among minority and underserved populations, in the access to information and the inability of parents to make informed decisions with balanced and accurate information. To achieve a significant effect on combating cervical cancer, eliminating HPV knowledge gaps is essential. One strategy is to first educate mothers. Thus, this study seeks to develop a health communication randomized controlled HPV educational intervention in DC that targets African-American mothers who have unvaccinated daughters between the ages of 9 and 17. Participants will be randomized into one of two arms, a group intervention arm or a wait-listed control group arm. The specific aims and hypotheses to be tested are: Aim 1: To conduct a randomized controlled trial health communication intervention to increase knowledge awareness about HPV and the HPV vaccine among low socioeconomic status African-American mothers. H1: African-American mothers receiving the group educational intervention will have greater HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge awareness compared to the wait-listed control group; and Aim 2: To assess the factors associated with mothers acceptability or non-acceptability of the HPV vaccine for their daughters. H2: Mothers receiving the group educational intervention will have greater HPV vaccine acceptability for their daughters than the wait-listed control group. Findings from this research will assist with translating and disseminating HPV evidenced-based findings to a population with low HPV knowledge awareness and high cervical cancer rates thereby addressing the important goal of reducing and eliminating cervical cancer disparities. [H3: Daughters of mothers receiving the group educational intervention will have a higher rate of vaccine uptake than daughters of mothers in the control group.] The public health relevance of this research is that it seeks to translate and disseminate evidence-based findings about HPV to a population with a heavy burden of cervical cancer and represents an extraordinary opportunity to reduce and eliminate HPV and cervical cancer disparities.",An HPV Health Communication Randomized Controlled Trial Intervention,8703511,K01CA155417,"['Age ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Certification ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Cities ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Venereal Warts ', ' Genital Warts ', ' Condylomata Acuminata ', ' Condyloma Accuminata ', ' Anogenital venereal warts ', ' Control Groups ', ' Daughter ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"PRISM: Personalized Reminders for Immunization using Short Messaging systems     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Problem: Vaccination coverage is well below Healthy People 2010 and 2020 goals, with substantial disparities for low-income and other disadvantaged populations. Health information technology interventions that link communication technologies, like text messaging, with electronic health record data offer low-cost, scalable opportunities to foster vaccination as well as other preventive care behaviors. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of such interventions on vaccination coverage at levels in line with other forms of reminder/recall particularly in low-income populations for whom other forms of reminder-recall have not been successful. However, their effect has not been as robust as needed. More effective messaging interventions are needed.  Adolescents, in particular minority adolescents, are not adequately protected against human papillomavirus (HPV) and its potential sequelae, which include cancer and genital warts. Despite the highly efficacious vaccine being recommended for all adolescents, completion rates among those who initiate the 3- dose series are low, particularly among minorities. Using a non-randomized design, we demonstrated the effect of conventional text message vaccine reminders, notifying a parent their child was due for the next dose, in increasing HPV vaccination in primarily, urban Latina adolescents. Although much improved over controls, only 50% received their next dose on time and only 45% completed the series. While these results strongly support the potential effectiveness of this intervention in minority populations for whom traditional forms of vaccination reminders have not worked, still fewer than half completed the vaccine series.  A potential advantage of text message HIT interventions that has not been well investigated is the ability to provide personalized messages. We propose to compare the use of personalized HPV vaccine text message reminders to conventional text message reminders among minority adolescents in a pragmatic randomized trial. The trans-theoretical model of behavior change will guide the tailoring of our text messages. Specific Aim: To compare the effectiveness in improving HPV vaccine series completion for minority adolescents of personalized text message reminders with tailored vaccine-health-literacy-promoting information vs. conventional text message vaccination reminders. Methods: 956 parents of adolescent girls and boys who have received the 1st HPV vaccine dose will be randomized to receive either: 1) personalized or (2) conventional text messages. Personalized reminders include vaccine health literacy-promoting information tailored to parental stage of decision-making. Conventional text message reminders solely notify a parent their child is due for the next dose such as used in previous HPV vaccine text message studies. Outcomes: The primary outcome is completion of 3-dose HPV vaccine series within 12 months. If successful this project could support a new paradigm in interactive health communication in a low cost, scalable manner that may be readily disseminated.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed translational research seeks to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the impact on HPV vaccine series completion of personalized HPV vaccination text message reminders to conventional text message reminders among minority adolescents. If successful this project could support a new paradigm in interactive health communication in a low cost, scalable, and sustainable manner that may be readily disseminated.            ",PRISM: Personalized Reminders for Immunization using Short Messaging systems,8758700,R01HS022677,[''],AHRQ,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,249912,0.07764163883313635
"Etiology of cervical cancer health disparity in American Indian women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in women worldwide. American Indian (AI) women living on the Northern Plains have a greater incidence of cervical cancer and suffer from a higher mortality rate. Our recent studies have shown that AI women have more than twice the incidence of HPV infection and that HPV positive AI women have a two times higher likelihood of having abnormal PAP tests than HPV positive Caucasian women; suggesting underlying causes which increase HPV pathology. One potential cofactor may be smoke exposure and its effects on the host immune response and HPV oncogenesis. Our data indicate that 4 times more AI women smoke as compared to Caucasian women and the majority of HPV positive AI women smoke. While smoking is a recognized risk factor for cervical cancer, the molecular interactions between HPV and smoke compounds are unknown. Our laboratory has recently shown that smoke carcinogen Benzo[a]Pyrene (BaP) increases the expression of HPV oncoproteins, suggesting a direct molecular link between HPV infection and exposure to smoke. We have also identified that curcumin, a natural anti-cancer compound, effectively inhibits the expression of HPV oncoproteins. Based on this compelling evidence, we hypothesize that exposure to tobacco smoke synergizes with HPV infection and increases the incidence and severity of cervical cancer in American Indian women by increasing the expression of HPV oncoproteins (E6/E7) and modulating cellular/humoral immune responses. Additionally, we hypothesize that curcumin or nanocurcumin may be effective methods for the repression of HPV infection in AI women. We propose to 1) investigate novel mechanisms of synergy between HPV infection, BaP and the development of cervical cancer, 2) evaluate the efficacy of curcumin/nanocurcumin to suppress HPV oncogene expression in preclinical and clinical settings, and 3) to investigate the effect of smoke exposure on cervical immune responses. The results of this study will provide information regarding underlying etiological factors that are responsible for cervical cancer health disparity in AI women and will ultimately reduce the burden of cervical cancer.

"Reducing Cervical Cancer in Appalachia In response to RFA ES-02-009, a multi-disciplinary group of investigators from the Ohio State University and the University of Michigan have collaborated to propose a Center for Population Health and Health Disparities focusing on an important health issue in underserved populations,cancer. The Center will initially focus on the goal of understanding why high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are observed in Appalachia Ohio, a mainly rural area in Southern and Eastern Ohio. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research within the framework of the Social Determinants of Health model in three inter-related projects and four supporting cores. All studies will be conducted in 16 clinics which represent the general population of women aged 18 and older in the region. We will utilize the Center's internal and external advisory committees and community partners organized into a community advisory board and Consortium of communityorganizations to facilitate the accomplishment of project goals. Project 1 will recruit 1600 women to an observational study to  investigate multi-level (social, environmental, behavioral, and biological) correlates of ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization, in Phase I. From this cohort of women, those who smoke (30%) will be eligible to participate in Project 2, which tests the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote smoking cessation (behavioral) and validate cessation endpoints with saliva cotinine measurements (biological) in a quasi-experimental trial design; those women who are in need of & Pap test (48% of 1600) will be eligible to participate in Phase II of Project 1 which will test the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization (behavioral) and follow-up for abnormalities (biological) detected in a quasi-experimental trial design. Project 3 will examine the contribution of HPV (biological) to cervical abnormalities in Appalachia in relation to individual-level behaviors (e.g. smoking, sexual activity) within the social and environmental region of Appalachia in a case-control observational study among women who have Pap smears in these 16 clinics.The research will be supported by four cores: A) Administration - fiscal and Center oversight; B) Biostatistics and Data Resources - sample selection, data management, data analysis, and population data resources; C) Clinical Correlative Sciences - collect, obtain and process biomarker specimens; and D) Behavioral Assessment and Intervention - train interviewers and lay health educators, conduct interviews, design intervention material, and facilitate  communication amongst sites. The Center includes a mechanism for pilot project solicitation, review and funding. This Center has institutional commitment in terms of personnel, funds and space, as well as, a commitment to focus on the problem of health disparities in the region. Finally, members of the team have worked together in the past in various settings that focus on the goals of the proposed Center and have an established relationship in Appalachian Ohio for the purpose of improving the health of the population. Future work of this Center will focus on moving this type of multi-level observational and interventional community-based research, into other areas where health disparities exist in relation to cancer withinour region. Cervical cancer disparities exist among women in Appalachia. Our previous work has found that the prevalence of factors known to cause cervical cancer e.g. tobacco use, genetic predisposition, HPV infection, and stress due to economic conditions, are disproportionately higher in this population.

"Disparities in Cervical Cancer Percursors and Deregualtion of Imprinted Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although screening for uterine cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN) and its aggressive treatment has resulted in decreased cervical cancer incidence and mortality, an estimated 11,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) and 40,000 cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS) continue to be diagnosed every year in the United States. ICC incidence is 60% higher and mortality over two times higher in African Americans compared to whites. Such disparate rates in incidence and mortality are despite comparable screening rates to detect precursor lesions, comparable prevalence of 'high risk' human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the etiologic agent, and co-factors such as cigarette smoking. Reasons for such disparities are largely unknown. A more detailed understanding of the etiology of lesions that progress will improve risk stratification to distinguish women with a low risk of progression from those likely to rapidly progress to invasive cancer. We posit that deregulation of genomically imprinted genes, a group of approximately 50 known growth-regulatory genes where only one allele is normally active, may predict progression to cervical cancer. We found that a substantial group of imprinted genes exhibit altered expression in ICC versus normal cervical epithelium. In addition, methylation analysis of two regulatory regions controlling IGF2 expression shows deviation from normal in specimens with CIN2-CIN3 classification and more profound deviation in invasive cancers. Together, these findings suggest that imprinted genes are deregulated in ICC and these features may improve detection of CIN cases likely to progress. Our central hypothesis is that deregulation at imprint regulatory elements of imprinted genes, likely influenced by environmental exposures, increases risk of progression to cervical cancer in women infected with 'high risk' HPV. We have already shown racial variation on the effect of environmental exposures on imprint deregulation, and thus, further hypothesize that higher risk in African Americans and Hispanics is due to race/ethnic differences in deregulation of these genes. Our specific aims are to: (1) determine if deregulation of imprint regulatory elements of known imprinted genes is associated with increased risk of progression of CIN1 to CIN2+, and whether this association varies by race/ethnicity; (2) determine whether aberrant methylation of imprint regulatory elements in cervical cells is similar to that found in peripheral blood cells, suggesting an early event; and associated with (i) transcriptional expression, and (ii) loss of imprinting; (3) evaluate whether deregulation of known imprinted genes in cervical cells can be used to discriminate women with CIN2+ among 500 Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance (ASCUS) cases. To address the Aims, we will recruit and follow 1,500 women with CIN1 and 500 with ASCUS, and examine the association between aberrant methylation markers at imprinted regulatory elements of 12 genes and progression from CIN1 to CIN2+. We will then test the performance of these markers to identify CIN2+ cases from among 500 ASCUS cases. Data from the proposed study will improve triage decisions and reduce disparities in ICC morbidity and mortality.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although screening for cervical intraepithelial lesions to prevent cervical cancer has resulted in decreased cancer incidence and mortality, an estimated 11,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer and 40,000 carcinomas in situ cases continue to be diagnosed every year in the United States with incidence 60% higher and mortality >2-times higher in African Americans compared to whites. We will recruit and follow 1,500 CIN1 and 500 cases of Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance (ASCUS), and examine the association between aberrant methylation at imprinted regulatory elements of 12 genes and progression to CIN2 or worse and then test the performance of these markers in ASCUS cases, independent of known co-factors. Data from this study will elucidate the role of epigenetic deregulation in CIN2+ and inform triage decisions, reducing disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality.

"Southeast Asian Women's Health Project     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Southeast Asian Women's Health Project Cervical cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among women in the United States, with more than 12,000 new cases and 4,000 deaths each year. Southeast Asians (SEAs) experience the highest cervical cancer incidence of any racial/ethnic group, yet they are screened at remarkably low rates. The most common cervical cancer screening is a Papanicolaou (Pap) test. Familial aspects (e.g., relationship between mothers and daughters), intergenerational conflict (e.g., bicultural straddling), and communication patterns (e.g., what is communicated, manner of communication) about cancer and cancer prevention are factors that potentially play a role in cervical cancer beliefs and Pap test uptake. The purpose of this proposed study is to determine the factors that influence Pap test uptake among SEAs, specifically Cambodian and Lao, mother-daughter dyads. The specific aims are to (1) describe the perceptions of cervical cancer, Pap tests, and cervical cancer screening behaviors among Cambodian and Lao women aged 18-65 and (2) examine, in terms of cervical cancer beliefs and Pap test uptake, the communication patterns among Cambodian and Lao mother-daughter dyads, aged 18-65, within the context of social and cultural factors (i.e., biculturalism, familialism), and how mothes and daughters influence one another. In this exploratory study, we will interview a purposeful sample of Cambodian and Lao women aged 18 to 65 living in Franklin County, Ohio. To examine communication patterns related to cervical cancer knowledge, beliefs, and Pap test uptake, we will conduct focus groups with each of the two ethnic groups (Cambodian and Lao): three focus groups with daughters only and three focus groups with mothers only. Those will inform in-depth interviews to be conducted in an additionally recruited set of mother-daughter dyads. Afterward, we will conduct four additional focus groups with separately recruited mother-daughter dyads from each ethnic group to clarify and validate         themes that emerged from previous focus groups and in-depth interviews. This study is innovative with its unique focus on Cambodian and Lao mother-daughter relationships, a key source of social support and influence on health behaviors that may potentially have lasting impact on women across generations. In this study, we will not only define culturally based factors that influence Pap test completion, but also describe them in the context of SEA culture and intergenerational cultural dialogue, allowing future interventions to leverage these beliefs to optimize intervention effect. This study will inform our long-term plan to develop a culturally appropriate, targeted cervical cancer educational intervention for SEA women.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cambodian and Lao women experience some of the highest cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in the United States, yet little research exists on ways to address and reduce this cancer health disparity in these two populations. The proposed exploratory study seeks to expand our understanding of Cambodian and Lao women's perceptions of cervical cancer and screening and examine the communication patterns between Cambodian and Lao mothers and daughters related to cervical cancer beliefs and Pap test uptake.

"Disparities in HPV vaccine completion: Identifying and quantifying the barriers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common sexually transmitted infection in the US, is an established necessary cause of cervical cancer. It is well documented that black, Hispanic and low-income women have persistently higher rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality compared to white and higher income women. The recent licensure of two highly efficacious vaccines against HPV signals an important opportunity to reduce these disparities. These vaccines are currently recommended for adolescents' ages 11-12 years, with catch-up vaccination to age 26 years for females and 21 years for males, in a 3-dose regimen over a 6 month period. Reducing disparities in cervical cancer depends on adequate vaccine uptake by those at greatest risk. Currently, many adolescents fail to receive all 3 doses. Even more troubling are strong and persistent disparities in completion: among females who receive at least 1 dose, black, Hispanic, and low- income individuals are significantly less likely to receive all 3 doses. Therefore, evidence-based and culturally relevant interventions are urgently needed to increase adherence to the recommended regimen. However, we currently have an insufficient understanding of the barriers to completion for these vulnerable populations. Therefore, we propose an exploratory and developmental study that will utilize a sequential mixed methods approach to identify and quantify barriers to HPV vaccination. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) identify and describe barriers to HPV vaccination completion among lower-income racial and ethnic minorities; (2) estimate the prevalence and strength of barriers and examine associations with race, ethnic identity, and socioeconomic status; (3) generate ideas for future interventions that will be culturally relevant and have the greatest potential for impact. Using Ecological Systems Theory as a framework, we will determine barriers at the individual, organizational, and community levels. We will conduct this study at an urban primary care center that serves a predominantly racial/ethnic minority and low-income population. Qualitative in-depth interviews with parents of adolescents will be conducted to identify possible barriers, adapt the conceptual model, and inform development of a structured survey. In the quantitative phase, this survey will be administered to a sample of 200 parents of adolescents and statistical analyses will estimate the prevalence and strength of barriers and examine correlates including race, ethnic identity, and socioeconomic status. The final phase will involve interpretive qualitative interviews to validate and triangulate quantitative findings. These conclusions will be used to develop interventions that have the greatest potential for impact by determining the most salient barriers to completion and strategies for overcoming these barriers. This proposed work is essential for providing the knowledge necessary to translate empirical findings about high HPV vaccine efficacy into improved women's health through evidence-based interventions to increase vaccination coverage for populations at greatest risk for the consequences of HPV infection.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary cause of cervical cancer that disproportionately affects black, Hispanic, and low-income women; these same populations are also the least likely to complete the 3-dose HPV vaccine regimen. Because barriers to completion are unknown, the purpose of this project is to understand reasons for the disparity in adequate uptake of HPV vaccine.

"A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among Pacific Islander Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among PI Women ABSTRACT Despite the fact that cervical cancer is one of the most preventable of cancers, it remains one of the top five causes of cancer deaths in the U.S. and in California. The Pap test has been shown to be effective in not only detecting cancer but also precancerous cells. Even with the introduction of HPV testing and vaccines, Pap tests represent an important cervical cancer prevention and early detection method for women in this country. Unfortunately, the Pap test is severely underutilized among many ethnic and racial populations, including Pacific Islanders (PIs) who have high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality data among specific PI ethnic groups is sparse, with available information underscoring significant cancer health disparities. In California as in the Pacific, cervical cancer is one of the top five causes of cancer deaths. Given the dearth of PI researchers and studies at the NIH level, community-based participatory research (CBPR) holds the potential for engaging community cultural experts alongside cancer health disparities researchers to address their pressing cervical cancer detection needs. This five year cluster unit randomized trial will develop and evaluate a social support intervention targeting both men and women to increase Pap testing decision making and behavior among Chamorro, Samoan and Tongan women age 18-65 years old in Southern California. We aim to: 1. Apply CBPR principles and processes for community/university partners throughout the grant period; 2. Develop and pretest two gender-specific and culturally tailored educational interventions for PI women and men. The interventions will be conducted separately by gender, and will employ a video, flipchart, and brochure, along with small-group discussions facilitated by gender-matched community health educators; 3. Develop and validate instruments measuring men's social support (provided), women's social support (perceived) and women's decision making utility; 4. Recruit and randomly assign community-based organizational samples and recruit and follow the cohorts of PI females and males in the intervention and control groups 5. Examine the associations that test the conceptual model regarding social support, decision making utility, and Pap testing intentions and behaviors; 6. Follow the cohort of PI women and men in the intervention vs. control groups to assess the impact of the intervention. Using a longitudinal cohort design, we will identify, recruit, and randomly assign PI members of churches and other community-based organizations to one of two intervention options: a) a culturally tailored social support intervention group for women and men consisting of community health educator-facilitated video, flipchart and brochure; or b) a usual care control group, consisting of pre-existing cancer education materials (brochures) for PI women and men delivered by community health educators. We posit that the planned social support intervention will increase men's provision, and women's perceptions, of Pap testing social support, leading to increases in women's prioritization of Pap testing decision making utility and Pap testing behaviors. The proposed study team involves long-standing university and community collaborators, and uses a multiple PI model to institutionalize shared participation and leadership structures. The community side of this CBPR study includes three CBOs with years of experience in health promotion, disease prevention, and collaborative research for their respective PI populations. The university side includes experienced behavioral scientists in CBPR, cancer control and decision making with multiethnic populations. This study will add to the existing science of cancer health disparities by adapting and applying well-established behavioral theories to understand the ways in which collectivist-oriented interventions influence individual women's cancer screening behavioral changes. Furthermore, this study will illuminate the CBPR engagement aspects necessary to conduct rigorous intervention research in small-size populations. The product of this study will be a culturally-tailored intervention that holds the potential to become a model for other collectivistic populations. Strengths of this study include: i) a focus on a major cancer health disparity; ii) development and testing of methods that are applicable to other health disparities; iii) a theoretical focus on decision making (a priority area for NCI regarding translational research); iv) an intervention approach that investigates and develops new strategies to improve cultural tailoring and evaluation; v) a focus on men; and vi) an ethnically diverse team of community and university investigators with an established track record in CBPR research.

"Kin Keeper:Reducing Disparities Through Cancer Literacy and Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of the phenomena health disparities requires researchers and public health educators to use many strategies to devise ways of reducing disparities and implement programs with the goal of eliminating those disparities. We are proposing to focus on breast and cervical cancer screening among Black, Latina, and Arab women living in the United States. This will be done by investigating the effectiveness of the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention, a female-family focused educational intervention for medically underserved women applied in a real world setting, using a randomized control trial design. The Kin KeeperSM model uses synergy and natural communication that exists among female family members to increase cancer prevention education and screening, which translates into functional cancer literacy. Simultaneously we will be using a two-step approach that also includes measuring the cost of the intervention, which is in important if the model is going to be sustained and have public utility in decreasing and ultimately eliminating cancer disparities. The goals of this research project are: 1) To determine if the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention increases first time and appropriately timed breast cancer screening rates among Black, Latina, and Arab women; 2) To determine if the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention increases first time and appropriately timed cervical cancer screening rates among Black, Latina, and Arab women; 3) To measure functional cancer literacy over time at the individual and family level and; 4) To assess costs and rates of health care utilization among women in the Kin KeeperSM model and the comparison group. By combining a community based approach with our university-community partnership as well as health services research methodology, we anticipate that we will have sustainable model to impact breast and cervical cancer disparities among medically underserved women.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this research will impact public health agencies and research on planning and intervention design; as to more effectively promote breast and cervical cancer screening and early detection for medically underserved women. This will be done by conducting our intervention outcomes research under real world conditions, partnering with public health agencies and by conducting a cost analysis.

"South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities DESCRIPTION: South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities. The objective of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities (SUCCESS) is to establish a regional center addressing the unequal burden of cervical cancer in Miami Dade-County. SUCCESS will build on Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) relationships which we have established with Haitians in the city of Miami and Hispanics in the city of Hialeah. We will also partner with a 3rd multi ethnic less urban community located in the southern unincorporated Miami-Dade. Recognizing this as a very medically underserved area, our community partners selected this as our 3rd site. Our multiple PI leadership  team includes two investigators from the University of Miami's (UM) Departments of Medicine and   Epidemiology, both members of the UM Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. The third PI directs a large network of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). In partnership with three local FQHCs,  SUCCESS will to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment. Building on these findings and existing community partnerships we will conduct cancer outreach tailored to the unique needs of each community. Our major research project is a randomized study among 600 women in our three communities who have not been adequately screened for cervical cancer. At each site, one third of the women would be exposed to standard NCI approved outreach interventions and a second group will receive a comprehensive home based CHW intervention encouraging women to have Pap Smear testing at one of the three FQHCs. While CHWs are a promising approach, many women exposed to this intervention remain unscreened. Thus we propose a third approach in which women at each site receive the CHW intervention but also have the option of screening through HPV testing done via home based self-sampling. Our experience in Little Haiti is that by coupling this innovative molecular technology with a CHW led culturally tailored approach nearly all women agree to be screened. The SUCCESS pilot project will be led by one of our minority junior faculty. Through a pre-post test design, she will examine the impact of a CHW led educational curriculum that has been specifically tailored women who are HIV positive. Lastly, our training core will develop formal seminars in health disparities research and CBPR for twelve clinical fellows and post-doctoral trainees and provide a more intensive longitudinal practicum and mentorship on community-based participatory research to four early stage investigators including a preparing a CBPR grant proposal. The vision of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities.(SUCCESS) is that through increased cervical cancer screening we could eliminate cervical cancer health disparities in our local community. To do so, SUCCESS will utilize the Community Based Participatory Research approach to reduce disparities through a combination of outreach, research and training.

"Feasibility of Virtual Agent Cervical Cancer Education for Hispanic Farmworkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinas experience higher cervical cancer (CC) incidence and mortality when compared to the general population in the United States. Many Latinas lack access to health care and experience literacy, communication, and knowledge barriers that prevent them from obtaining CC screening. Patient navigator (PN) and other similar interventions have been implemented to increase CC screening rates; however, few have focused directly on the needs of Latinas. Interactive technological interventions, like embodied conversational agents (ECA), are currently used in other populations, settings, and for other health topics, but no known initiative has used culturally and literacy appropriate technology to deliver Spanish-language CC education as part of a PN intervention. This study aims to create and conduct a preliminary evaluation of a Spanish-language Virtual Patient Educator (VPE) multimedia application to augment a PN intervention for increasing CC screening rates among Latinas in a rural agricultural community. Using the Social Cognitive Theory, the proposed project will be conducted in 2 phases. In Phase 1, the research team will engage community members to develop a low literacy Spanish-language interactive multimedia application consisting of an ECA. Using theoretical principles and drawing from our formative research, the project team will design the VPE through systematic and technical processes. Ongoing feedback (usability testing) from members of the intended audience will be carried out to ensure that patients (users) can perform intended system tasks efficiently, effectively, and satisfactoril. Once usability testing is complete, a series of learner verification interviews will be conducted t assess initial suitability of the VPE. Since the VPE will be the first known Spanish-language ECA used to augment a PN intervention, it is important to see whether patients accept the VPE and whether it is feasible to conduct a study of patient navigation augmented by the VPE. In Phase 2, a preliminary evaluation of 2 methods of patient navigation delivery (with and without VPE) will be conducted with 60 participants who are not up to date with recommended CC screening according to American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians' guidelines. Cluster randomization will be used to randomize patients to 1 of 2 PN intervention conditions: (1) PN; or (2) PN plus VPE (PN+VPE) using date of clinic as unit of randomization. The preliminary evaluation will examine the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, data collection, and acceptability of VPE application. Exploratory data will also be collected regarding the potential impact of PN+VPE on behavioral capacity and self-efficacy for obtaining CC screening, Pap test adherence, and satisfaction with care. The proposed project will advance our research towards the development of interactive technology interventions to disseminate health education to disparate populations.          Latinas experience higher cervical cancer incidence and mortality when compared to the general population in the United States. The proposed study is the first to develop interactive technology to augment a patient navigation intervention by providing patient education about human papillomavirus, cervical cancer, and the importance of regular cervical cancer screening. A patient navigation intervention augmented by interactive educational technology is expected to enhance and extend access to health information and health care for Spanish-speaking Latinas living in a rural agricultural community.

"Comparative and Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing HPV-Related Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, more than 25,000 cases of invasive cancer attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection occur in the United States; nearly 50% are cervical cancer, while the rest involve the oral cavity/oropharynx, anus, vulva, penis, and vagina. Collectively, these account for substantial morbidity and mortality, contribute to health disparities, and are associated with high economic costs. Advancements in HPV-related cancer epidemiology, coupled with new (e.g., HPV-16,-18 vaccines, HPV DNA testing) and emerging (e.g., biomarkers, therapeutic vaccines) technologies provide a remarkable opportunity to improve cancer prevention efforts. However, critical challenges remain with respect to clinical decision-making and prevention policy, pertaining to knowledge gaps and heterogeneities in the natural history of different cancers, uncertainties in HPV type distribution following HPV-16,-18 vaccination, and the real-world clinical effectiveness of emerging technologies. We propose to employ a decision-analytic approach, developing a flexible modeling framework that will allow us to synthesize the best available data; evaluate the health and economic consequences of alternative strategies; explore the uncertainty around their outcomes; explicitly quantify the tradeoffs associated with different approaches; and inform timely clinical and policy questions. By achieving our aims, we expect to have an impact on (1) the analytic methods of decision science; (2) the equitable distribution and rationale use of new technology; (3) the effectiveness of strategies for cancer prevention through clinical guidelines and national policies; (4) HPV-related cancer outcomes, including reduced incidence, enhanced quality of life, improved survival, and reduced disparities; and (5) the financial and economic profile of delivering cancer-related health services.        Rapid advances in the fields of HPV-related cancer epidemiology and medical technology present opportunities to revolutionize the approach to cancer prevention in the U.S. but have outpaced the ability of policy makers to make informed decisions regarding optimal adoption of health interventions. In this project, we propose to develop a flexible modeling framework that will enable us to synthesize the best available data on HPV, provide insight into the comparative and cost-effectiveness of different strategies, and assist in informed public health and clinical decision-making with respect to prevention of HPV-related cancers.

"Feasibility of Virtual Agent Cervical Cancer Education for Hispanic Farmworkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinas experience higher cervical cancer (CC) incidence and mortality when compared to the general population in the United States. Many Latinas lack access to health care and experience literacy, communication, and knowledge barriers that prevent them from obtaining CC screening. Patient navigator (PN) and other similar interventions have been implemented to increase CC screening rates; however, few have focused directly on the needs of Latinas. Interactive technological interventions, like embodied conversational agents (ECA), are currently used in other populations, settings, and for other health topics, but no known initiative has used culturally and literacy appropriate technology to deliver Spanish-language CC education as part of a PN intervention. This study aims to create and conduct a preliminary evaluation of a Spanish-language Virtual Patient Educator (VPE) multimedia application to augment a PN intervention for increasing CC screening rates among Latinas in a rural agricultural community. Using the Social Cognitive Theory, the proposed project will be conducted in 2 phases. In Phase 1, the research team will engage community members to develop a low literacy Spanish-language interactive multimedia application consisting of an ECA. Using theoretical principles and drawing from our formative research, the project team will design the VPE through systematic and technical processes. Ongoing feedback (usability testing) from members of the intended audience will be carried out to ensure that patients (users) can perform intended system tasks efficiently, effectively, and satisfactoril. Once usability testing is complete, a series of learner verification interviews will be conducted t assess initial suitability of the VPE. Since the VPE will be the first known Spanish-language ECA used to augment a PN intervention, it is important to see whether patients accept the VPE and whether it is feasible to conduct a study of patient navigation augmented by the VPE. In Phase 2, a preliminary evaluation of 2 methods of patient navigation delivery (with and without VPE) will be conducted with 60 participants who are not up to date with recommended CC screening according to American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians' guidelines. Cluster randomization will be used to randomize patients to 1 of 2 PN intervention conditions: (1) PN; or (2) PN plus VPE (PN+VPE) using date of clinic as unit of randomization. The preliminary evaluation will examine the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, data collection, and acceptability of VPE application. Exploratory data will also be collected regarding the potential impact of PN+VPE on behavioral capacity and self-efficacy for obtaining CC screening, Pap test adherence, and satisfaction with care. The proposed project will advance our research towards the development of interactive technology interventions to disseminate health education to disparate populations. Latinas experience higher cervical cancer incidence and mortality when compared to the general population in the United States. The proposed study is the first to develop interactive technology to augment a patient navigation intervention by providing patient education about human papillomavirus, cervical cancer, and the importance of regular cervical cancer screening. A patient navigation intervention augmented by interactive educational technology is expected to enhance and extend access to health information and health care for Spanish-speaking Latinas living in a rural agricultural community.",Feasibility of Virtual Agent Cervical Cancer Education for Hispanic Farmworkers,8824605,R21CA167418,"['agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Collection ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Feedback ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Persuasion ', ' Persuasive Communication ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Shame ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' Guidelines ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Visual ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Educational Technology ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' General farm worker NOS ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Lack of Coordination ', ' Incoordination ', ' Dyscoordination ', ' Coordination Disorder ', ' Co-ordination disorder ', ' Abnormal coordination ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' interactive multimedia ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' ACOG ', ' American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cervical Cancer Education ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' usability ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' ']",NCI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,5491,0.1261798612515469
"Implementation Evaluation of a Cervical Cancer Screening Initiative in Cusco, Per     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer continues to be the second most common cancer among women worldwide. In Peru, rough estimates place screening coverage between 7-43% of the eligible population. Effective community-based interventions are needed to address screening coverage in the Andean region of Peru, but the development of such interventions are limited by gaps in our understanding of: (1) cultural beliefs toward cervical cancer and HPV; and (2) effective intervention programs targeting specific priority populations, such as indigenous Quechua women. This project is significant because it will positively impact gynecological health among Quechua women through the implementation of a well-executed, participatory, implementation evaluation and social marketing intervention pilot study to maximize screening opportunities. The overall goal of this application is to conduct Rapid Assessment, Response, and Evaluation (RARE) - a rapid ethnographic assessment approach - to evaluate a large cervical cancer screening initiative and use the formative findings to design and pilot a brief social marketing intervention. The social marketing intervention will be aimed to increase screening uptake during the third year of the 3-year screening initiative. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that interventions using a social marketing strategy will be effective for increasing cervical cancer screening in Quechua populations when such screening opportunities are both convenient and low cost. The two specific aims are to: (1) evaluate the social, behavioral and cultural factors that impact cervical cancer screening uptake among Quechua women from the Cusco, Peru region using RARE; and (2) develop and pilot a social marketing intervention to increase cervical cancer screening uptake and appropriate follow-up care targeted to Quechua women in the Cusco, Peru region. The proposed project is innovative because it will use RARE to conduct an implementation evaluation of the screening initiative and inform the design and piloting of a brief social marketing intervention. The contribution of the proposed research is expected to be the development of a promotional strategy which will consist of photonovella booklets and radio advertisements, and be supplemented by 'word of mouth' communications using social network analysis.          A better understanding of knowledge, risk perceptions, and cultural attitudes among indigenous Quechua women toward cervical cancer screening will assist in developing more effective social marketing efforts and impacting cervical cancer disparities in groups suffering the greatest burden of the disease, thereby improving public health. The proposed study will develop and pilot a culturally appropriate social marketing intervention based on systematic ethnographic research to increase cervical cancer screening among Quechua women in the Cusco region of Peru in partnership with a large, three-year cervical cancer screening initiative program.

"South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION: South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities. The objective of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities (SUCCESS) is to establish a regional center addressing the unequal burden of cervical cancer in Miami Dade-County. SUCCESS will build on Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) relationships which we have established with Haitians in the city of Miami and Hispanics in the city of Hialeah. We will also partner with a 3rd multi ethnic less urban community located in the southern unincorporated Miami-Dade. Recognizing this as a very medically underserved area, our community partners selected this as our 3rd site. Our multiple PI leadership  team includes two investigators from the University of Miami's (UM) Departments of Medicine and   Epidemiology, both members of the UM Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. The third PI directs a large network of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). In partnership with three local FQHCs,  SUCCESS will to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment. Building on these findings and existing community partnerships we will conduct cancer outreach tailored to the unique needs of each community. Our major research project is a randomized study among 600 women in our three communities who have not been adequately screened for cervical cancer. At each site, one third of the women would be exposed to standard NCI approved outreach interventions and a second group will receive a comprehensive home based CHW intervention encouraging women to have Pap Smear testing at one of the three FQHCs. While CHWs are a promising approach, many women exposed to this intervention remain unscreened. Thus we propose a third approach in which women at each site receive the CHW intervention but also have the option of screening through HPV testing done via home based self-sampling. Our experience in Little Haiti is that by coupling this innovative molecular technology with a CHW led culturally tailored approach nearly all women agree to be screened. The SUCCESS pilot project will be led by one of our minority junior faculty. Through a pre-post test design, she will examine the impact of a CHW led educational curriculum that has been specifically tailored women who are HIV positive. Lastly, our training core will develop formal seminars in health disparities research and CBPR for twelve clinical fellows and post-doctoral trainees and provide a more intensive longitudinal practicum and mentorship on community-based participatory research to four early stage investigators including a preparing a CBPR grant proposal.          The vision of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities.(SUCCESS) is that through increased cervical cancer screening we could eliminate cervical cancer health disparities in our local community.

"HPV Vaccination among Low-Income Hispanic Adolescents     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is a safe and effective primary prevention strategy for cervical cancer and other anogenital cancers, yet vaccination rates are remarkably low. Only 53% of adolescent females have initiated the vaccine (received ¿1 dose). More importantly, far fewer (35%) have completed the 3-dose series, which is vital for effective cancer prevention. Moreover, there are growing disparities in HPV vaccine completion rates, with Hispanic females significantly less likely to complete the series than non-Hispanic Whites. Low rates of vaccine completion are of crucial concern for populations disproportionally affected by HPV-related disease such as Latinas, whose cervical cancer incidence rates are 60% higher than in non- Hispanic Whites. Although studies have examined predictors of HPV vaccine initiation, there is a fundamental gap in the literature about predictors of series completion. Because receipt of all 3 doses is essential for maximum protection against HPV, identifying factors that influence whether Hispanic adolescents complete the series is critical for informing future intervention efforts. The long-term goal of ths research program is to develop effective strategies for increasing HPV vaccine completion among low-income Hispanic adolescents, thereby reducing morbidity, mortality, and disparities associated with HPV-related disease. The objective of this application is to determine key predictors of HPV vaccine completion, with special emphasis on identifying modifiable psychosocial and cultural factors associated with completion of the series. We propose two specific aims: (1) Determine key predictors of HPV vaccine completion (receipt of all 3 doses) among low-income Latina mothers of adolescents who have received the first dose of HPV vaccine and (2) Provide complementary qualitative information about facilitators and barriers that play an important role in HPV vaccine completion. To achieve Aim 1 we will conduct a yearlong longitudinal study of low-income Latina mothers whose adolescent daughter/son initiates the HPV vaccine. At baseline, both mothers and their daughter/son (aged 9-17) will complete a survey to assess cultural (e.g., acculturation) and psychosocial factors (e.g., perceived barriers to completion, subjective norms for completing the series) from major theories of health behavior (Health Belief Model, Theory of Planned Behavior). These variables will be used to predict our primary outcome variable: HPV vaccine completion status, as verified by the child's medical record. To achieve Aim 2 we will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of mothers from the longitudinal study. The goal of these interviews is to provide greater insight into cultural/psychosocial factors associated with completion, to identify factors related to completion not reflected in traditional theories of health behavior, an to investigate factors that may arise after mothers complete the baseline assessment. Outcomes from this project are expected to have an important positive impact by advancing knowledge needed to develop effective strategies for increasing HPV vaccine completion rates among low-income Hispanic adolescents.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination can prevent certain types of cancers, yet studies suggest that most adolescents do not receive all three doses of the vaccine, which could leave them at risk for cancer. The goal of this project is to identify cultura and psychosocial factors that affect whether low-income Hispanic adolescents -- a group who is at increased risk for the types of cancers caused by HPV -- receive all three doses of the vaccine. Findings will be used to inform the development of future interventions aimed at increasing rates of HPV vaccine completion among low-income Hispanic adolescents.            ",HPV Vaccination among Low-Income Hispanic Adolescents,8689432,R21CA178592,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Daughter ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Medical Records ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mothers ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Play ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Son ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' cancer prevention ', ' infectious organism ', ' Infectious Agent ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' psychosocial ', ' cancer risk ', ' success ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' vaccine effectiveness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Anogenital cancer ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' ']",NCI,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,54819,0.13802807797825561
"A Text Message Intervention to Increase HPV Vaccine Completion in Young Latinas     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Angelica Roncancio, Ph.D. is a motivated postdoctoral fellow, trained as a behavioral scientist, who is currently working at the Center for Health Promotion and Prevention Research at the University of Texas Health Science Center Houston (UTHSC-H) School of Public Health. The overall goal of this NCI K01 career development proposal is to provide Dr. Roncancio with the additional research skills necessary to launch an independent career focused on reducing HPV-related cancer disparities among Latinas. Dr. Roncancio's research examines the psychosocial and cultural determinants of cervical-cancer screening and HPV vaccination among Latinas and seeks to modify health behavior through innovative approaches to screening and vaccination completion. Under the mentorship of Dr. Maria Fernandez she will receive specialized, mentored training in the following areas: 1) cancer disparities in Latino populations, 2) the development of theory-based interventions, and 3) the use of technology in health promotion.          UTHSC-H's rich training environment provides junior investigators with the resources necessary to become independent, productive, and highly successful researchers. For example, it provides outstanding opportunities for developing skills in grant writing, manuscript publication, and project management. UTHSC-H also offers a large variety of courses, workshops, and seminars relevant to public health and behavioral science, along with access to some of the most renowned prevention scientists in cancer research.          Dr. Roncancio's long-term career goal as an independent health researcher is to improve both cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination rates, ultimately aiding in the reduction of cervical cancer disparity in Latinas. She will develop a research program focused on the development and implementation of innovative, culturally appropriate, theory-based interventions to increase cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination among underserved Latinas.          In addition, Dr. Roncancio outlines four short term goals to be achieved throughout the award period that will serve as the foundation for an independent research career: 1) to increase her science-based knowledge in behavioral theory and its application to the development of cancer interventions for underserved populations, particularly Latinas; 2) to increase her knowledge in the use of technology in interventions targeted at hard-to- reach underserved populations; 3) to increase experience in implementing interventions in hard-to-reach populations; and 4) to participate in professional development activities related to cancer health disparities. These goals will be achieved through a combination of formal coursework and directed readings, experience in implementing several research projects, experience in developing and publishing manuscripts, and intensive mentoring to ensure that Dr. Roncancio achieves each of her specific short term goals and becomes a successful independent cervical cancer disparities researcher.          The aims of the proposed research are to: 1) develop an Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction (IM) that explains Spanish-speaking Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series, and 2) develop and pilot test an innovatively-delivered IM-based intervention (via video text messaging) for Spanish-speaking Latino mothers to encourage HPV vaccine series completion for their adolescent daughters. This research is both important and timely given the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer's 2012 recommendation to increase HPV vaccination efforts to combat the rise in incidence rates of some HPV-associated cancers and the finding that Latino adolescent girls are less likely non-Latino white adolescent girls to complete the HPV vaccine series.          The proposed aims will be accomplished through four successive plans of study: 1) a qualitative study to identify the beliefs that underlie Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series; 2) a longitudinal study to identify the associations between the IM predictor variables, intentions, and behavior; 3) a usability study to evaluate the acceptability and appropriateness of the video texts to be delivered to the mothers' cellular phones that were developed to increase HPV vaccine series completion; and 4) a longitudinal pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a theory-based intervention that uses video text messaging as an innovative channel of delivery.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will address a significant gap in our knowledge of the factors that influence Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series and will result in the development of an innovatively-delivered, theory-based intervention that may increase vaccine completion in this population. This intervention will be the first of its kind and has the potential to increase HPV vaccine completion in an underserved population known for low completion rates and for being disproportionately affected by cervical cancer disparities.

"HPV and Cancer mHealth Prevention Education for HIV Positive Women Pilot Study     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is a research assistant professor with academic training in health promotion, education, and behavior, as well as postdoctoral training in HIV/AIDS prevention, health disparities, and health services research. She also has data management expertise and clinical immunology experience. The candidate has completed two pilot studies that examined HPV infection and cervical cancer prevention knowledge, beliefs and screening behaviors among women living with HIV (WLH). The candidate is seeking additional training needed to develop and implement effective cancer health (including mHealth) communication and community navigation strategies to improve WLH's timely use of cancer screening, diagnostic and treatment services and procedures. The candidate's long-term goal is to obtain extramural research funding for her independent research program focusing on the prevention and control of HPV-mediated cancers among WLH over the next 5-10 years. Promotion to associate professor (tenure- or research-track) is an intermediate goal that the candidate is striving to attain within the next five years. A combination of formal didactic trainig and experiential learning opportunities will be used to acquire cancer prevention and control research skills in the following areas: cancer health (including mHealth) communication, cancer epidemiology, HPV-mediated cancer biology, community navigation, advanced epidemiological research skills (e.g., social epidemiology, n- of-1 research study designs, and, multilevel modeling). The candidate will use the cancer prevention and control research and health communication knowledge and skills acquired through the proposed career development award to conduct formative research needed to inform intervention development in which she will examine cancer health information seeking and sharing among WLH as well as their non-clinical HIV service providers (e.g., HIV/STI risk reduction counselors). Non-clinical HIV service providers will be included because, in addition to the fact that these individuals are already promoting safe sexual practices among WLH, they are also able to reach marginalized groups of WLH such as those who are homeless. This includes sheltered and unsheltered homeless WLH. The candidate's mentors and co-mentors have scientific expertise and community-based participatory research experience that will increase the likelihood of the proposed specific aims being successfully completed. The candidate will first examine HPV-mediated cancer prevention knowledge, beliefs and behaviors, as well as cancer health communication seeking and sharing behaviors (including the use of technology to find health information) (Aim 1). These formative research data will then be used to inform the development (Aim 2) and subsequent pilot testing and evaluation (Aim 3) of an HPV- mediated cancer prevention mHealth education intervention aimed at training WLH who already serve as peer leaders and non-clinical HIV service providers to use mHealth tools and community navigation strategies to disseminate HPV-mediated cancer prevention education. As community navigators, these individuals will use cancer health (including mHealth) communication and community navigation strategies to increase awareness about HPV-mediated cancer risk. This will include promoting cancer risk reducing behaviors such as safe sexual practices and the timely use of recommended cancer screening, diagnostic, and treatment services and procedures). Recall and reminder messages will be sent for screening and follow-up cancer care appointments. User-defined social support messages will also be sent to WLH who may be encountering access to cancer care barriers. The candidate will disseminate the scientific research findings to local, regional, national, and international audiences via presentations that she will give at scientific conferences and annual meetings as well as peer-reviewed publications that she will produce. Most relevant to the candidate's long-term goal of attaining research independence is increasing her number of peer-reviewed publications from her current publication rate of approximately three per year to four or more produced annually by the end of the 5-year training period and the submission of at least one grant proposal (e.g., R01-level funding) by the end of the 5-year training period. The proposed career development/training and research activities will enable the candidate to realize her long-term career goal of becoming an independent cancer researcher with expertise in using cancer health communication, community navigation, and mHealth technologies to address health system failures encountered by vulnerable, medically-underserved WLH along the cancer care continuum. Continued mentoring and opportunities for team science research collaborations will facilitate the candidate's successful progression to being an independent cancer researcher. WLH and non-clinical HIV service providers will be recruited from Ryan White funded clinics and AIDS-service organizations located in urban and rural geographical areas of South Carolina that represent a microcosm of disparities in HIV/AIDS, cancer, and other chronic illness that disproportionately burden medically underserved minority populations. Addressing health system failures that occur along the cancer care continuum that result in missed opportunities to prevent, detect, diagnose and treat HPV-mediated cancers will help to reduce the burden of cancer incidence and mortality among this high cancer risk, vulnerable group of WLH. The proposed HPV-mediated cancer mHealth prevention education intervention will be conducted in a community-based setting and builds upon an existing academic-community partnership between the candidate and a local AIDS-service organization. The candidate has a supportive, resource-intensive scientific environment for her cancer research training.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-positive women, who are predominantly African-American (AA) with an already disproportionate burden of cervical cancer, have a greater risk for developing cervical cancer as well as other HPV-mediated anogenital and head-and-neck cancers because of their weakened immune systems that decrease their body's ability to clear potentially oncogenic HPV infection. Innovative community-driven mHealth solutions focused on addressing cancer prevention knowledge deficits and promoting adherence to recommended cancer screening, detection and treatment services and procedures will be developed and evaluated. Mobile technologies are a promising, cost-effective approach to reducing these cancer health disparities among women living with HIV/AIDS by improving HPV-mediated cancer health outcomes and timely use of cancer care services for this high cancer risk, vulnerable group of largely medically underserved women.

"Adapting patient navigation to promote cancer screening in Chicagos Chinatown    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the presence of five major academic medical centers, a large county hospital, and two NCI designated comprehensive cancer centers, Chicago has some of the worst cancer disparities between income groups in the US. This burden is accentuated with respect to linguistically and culturally isolated immigrants who do not traditionally benefit from nor participate in research. In particular, Chinese women in Chicago, a significantly understudied population, have unacceptably low breast and cervical cancer screening rates which are only half the rates of white women.  This application is a direct outgrowth of concerns expressed by leaders of Chicago's Chinatown community about the need to educate and empower low income Chinese women about cancer prevention and control. Patient navigators (PN) have been studied in African American, Latino, and white populations. However, PN research has largely focused on follow-up of patients with cancer or abnormal findings, rarely to improve screening rates. We seek to study the dissemination of PN behavioral health services interventions by implementing a tailored PN intervention with a focus on increasing breast and cervical cancer screening as well as follow-up for the largely immigrant population of low income women in Chinatown. Our proposed research builds on two NIH funded PN studies, our Chinatown RC4 research infrastructure grant activities, including a community data resource center, and our long-standing community based participatory research (CBPR) partnership with Chinatown's major safety net provider, Mercy Medical Center.  Using mixed methods within a CBPR approach, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of PN adaptation and extension to cancer control education and screening under the auspices of our community research partner, the Chinese American Service League. We will study the fundamental mechanisms required to optimally adapt interventions focused on immigrant populations that are culturally and linguistically isolated. The proposed project seeks to expand the role of PNs, to learn more about what determines the effectiveness of PNs as health educators, how to encourage breast and cervical cancer screening, and how PNs can become trusted and respected community health workers and advocates that provide essential links between the community and the health care system for low income women in Chicago's Chinatown.  This research will assess how Chinese women interact with health information and resources via a PN team to make health decisions and access the health care system. Women comprise the largest segment of health workers, health consumers, and health decision makers for their families and communities, but are underrepresented accessing appropriate health services among Asian immigrant populations. Once women are empowered, informed health consumers, they become catalysts for social change.        This proposed project aims to adapt the rapidly growing phenomenon of patient navigation into a broader effort to use community health workers for culturally competent cancer control and prevention. Our CBPR approach, grounded in the long-standing prestige of our community organization and safety net provider partners, offers the opportunity to close the loop between community-defined health problems and access to the local health care system. Because many women in Illinois already have public insurance coverage for cancer screening and follow-up but do not take advantage of this resource, this proposal has major relevance for future efforts to increase access for vulnerable populations once broader health reform laws are implemented.

"HPV Methylation as a Biomarker of Viral Persistence and Risk of Cervical Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The estimated prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection for women in the U.S. is over 10 million, with approximately 6.2 million new infections annually, yet most HPV infections are transient and clear within 24 months. About 12,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported annually in the U.S., and only women with persistent high-risk HPV infection are at risk of dysplasia (CIN) that ultimately progresses to cervical cancer. It is unknown why HPV infections clear in most women yet persist in others. The current false positive rate of pap test screening (~1 in 10 are ""abnormal""), results in follow up colposcopy and biopsy that are financially and emotionally costly. Thus, there is a great clinical need to identify biomarkers that are predictive of the small number of high-risk HPV infections that will persist and progress, so that medical resources can be directed at the women truly at risk of cervical disease. Methylation of viral DNA sequences (especially in the L1 and L2 ORF) as a host defense mechanism is gaining attention. The process of methylation depends on dietary folate and the demethylation depends on base excision repair (BER) to restore native cytosine in CpG sequences. Rarely have studies prospectively followed women over time with the specific goal of measuring viral persistence. We have available for the proposed study samples of DNA collected from a unique cohort called the Carolina Women's Care Study (CWCS) supported by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (P20 MD001770). The study was initiated to identify biomarkers of HPV persistence in college-age women. DNA isolated from exfoliated cervical cells collected longitudinally in the CWCS will allow us to uncover candidate biomarkers based on the following hypothesis. Alterations in the methylation of HPV DNA ultimately determine viral persistence or clearance, and epigenetic methylation of HPV sequences is controlled by folate metabolism and/or DNA repair processes. Accordingly, polymorphisms in genes involved in folate metabolism and/or base excision repair will serve as excellent biomarkers for HPV persistence, and thus, risk ultimately for cervical cancer. Aim 1 will determine the methylation status of the viral L1 and L2 genes in exfoliated cervical cells collected as part of the CWCS, which followed college age women prospectively for up to four years and identified participants who rapidly cleared the HPV viral infection along with others who had persistent HPV infections. Aim 2 will determine the prevalence of polymorphisms (SNPs) in folate metabolizing enzymes and DNA repair enzymes in the CWCS cohort and will correlate specific SNPs with the levels of high- risk HPV DNA methylation, viral persistence, and viral clearance. The clinical and translational impact of this study will be to identify genetic interactions between methylation of HPV, folate metabolizing enzymes and DNA repair enzymes that will serve as biomarkers for HPV persistence, and thus, risk for cervical cancer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cervical cancer, caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, affects 12,000 women annually in the U.S., yet cervical cancer is a rare outcome of HPV infection, which is estimated to be greater than 10 million. Moreover, Pap test screening produces approximately 1 in 10 abnormal tests that require costly and emotionally taxing follow ups that often show no evidence of disease. This project will discover new biomarkers that can predict which HPV infections are most likely to lead to cervical cancer, thus greatly reducing the economic and psychological burden associated with the current system of testing.            ",HPV Methylation as a Biomarker of Viral Persistence and Risk of Cervical Disease,8627150,R21CA169998,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Attention ', ' Biopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Colposcopy ', ' Cytology ', ' 2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino- ', ' Cytosine ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Site-Specific DNA-methyltransferase ', ' Modification Methylases ', ' EC 2.1.1.113 ', ' Dnmt ', ' DNA-Methyltransferases ', ' DNA Modification Methyltransferases ', ' DNA Modification Methylases ', ' Unscheduled DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA Damage Repair ', ' DNA Repair ', ' virus DNA ', ' viral DNA ', ' Economics ', ' Enzymes ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Infection ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mammalia ', ' Mammals ', ' L-Methionine ', ' L-Isomer Methionine ', ' Methionine ', ' Protein Methylation ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Reading ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' South Carolina ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' tetrahydropteroylglutamate ', ' tetrahydrofolic acid ', ' 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid ', ' Tetrahydrofolates ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Woman ', ' Benzoic acid, 4-(((5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)amino)carbonyl)- ', ' Am80 ', ' Am 80 ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' Measures ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' ORFs ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' Caring ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Folate ', ' Procedures ', ' Cervical ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Uterine Cervix Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Cervix Uteri Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Cervix Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasms ', ' Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Genetic ', ' dyscrasia ', ' Dysplasia ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' HPV infection ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' experience ', ' methyl group ', ' demethylation ', ' repair endonuclease ', ' repair enzyme ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Folic Acid Metabolosm ', ' Folate Metabolism ', ' folic acid metabolism ', ' DNA Base Excision Repair ', ' Base Excision Repairs ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' DNA Repair Enzymes ', ' DNA Methyltransferase ', ' Host Defense Mechanism ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Collecting Cell ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' No Evidence of Disease ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' High risk Human papilloma virus ', ' High risk Human Papillomavirus ', ' High risk HPV ', ' High Risk Oncogenic HPV ', ' HPV-High Risk ', ' minority health ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' gDNA ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R21,2014,150379,0.23478358492350654
"Determinants of HPV vaccination for Hispanic parents from the Texas-Mexico border     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic women along the Texas-Mexico border experience more cases of and deaths from cervical cancer compared to the nation. Cervical cancer is preventable using the HPV vaccine, which is recommended for girls/boys and women/men aged 11-26. Compared to U.S. Hispanic girls, a smaller proportion of Texas Hispanic girls (ages 13-17) (65% vs. 58%) receive ¿1 dose HPV vaccine and fewer complete the vaccine series (¿3 doses; 42% vs. 35%). Given the cervical cancer disparities in incidence and death among Hispanic women in this area, it is of great public health importance to promote the adoption of the vaccine and compliance with its dosing schedule. The objective of this research plan is to examine determinants of Hispanic mothers' intention to vaccinate and actual initiation and completion of the three dose series for their daughter aged 11-17. The proposed research plan seeks to: (1) identify determinants of mothers' HPV vaccine intentions, initiation and completion; (2) understand providers' perspectives on recommending the vaccine; and (3) design a culturally-relevant, theoretically grounded HPV intervention for low-income, Hispanics mothers along the Texas-Mexico border. The research is innovative because it: (1) focuses on a on a largely underserved, vulnerable population with specific needs; (2) assesses the feasibility of a clinic-based, cervical cancer prevention intervention for Hispanics mothers; and (3) focuses on the interpersonal communication between the parent, the child, and the provider. Achievement of the aims will contribute further evidence regarding the critical role of parents and providers in increasing HPV vaccine uptake and completion among girls to eliminate cervical cancer disparities among this population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a critical need to understand why there is less than optimal uptake of the HPV vaccine among Hispanic girls along the Texas-Mexico border, despite the high cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates for Hispanic women in this area. The purpose of this research is to understanding the determinants for parental intentions and acceptance of HPV vaccination and factors influencing provider's intention to recommend vaccination. Findings will guide the development of an evidence-based intervention to increase initiation and completion of the HPV vaccine among Hispanics girls.            ",Determinants of HPV vaccination for Hispanic parents from the Texas-Mexico border,8767636,K01CA181530,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Adoption ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Daughter ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mexico ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mothers ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Woman ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Interpersonal Communication ', ' Personal Communication ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' pediatrician ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' parent role ', ' parental role ', ' social ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' career development ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,K01,2014,94289,0.2601422330903955
"Parkland-UT Southwestern PROSPR Center Colon Cancer Screening in a Safety net     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the expanded Parkland-UT Southwestern PROSPR Center is to optimize cervical and colon cancer screening in our integrated safety-net system. The population we contribute is the most diverse and disadvantaged in the PROSPR network, representing patients infrequently included in large scale research networks. Parkland's cervical cancer screen-eligible population of more than 78,000 adult women is 6 1% Hispanic, 24% African American, and 8% Non-Hispanic White. All are low-income and few have private insurance leading them to rely on public insurance or charity care. Thus, our patients represent the ""traditionally underserved"" groups experiencing cervical cancer disparities - higher incidence and mortality, and lower screening and HPV vaccination. Parkland delivers the full cervical cancer screening process (risk assessment, early detection, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment) through an integrated system of 11 neighborhood-based primary care clinics, 11 women's health centers, and specialty clinics (dysplasia, gynecology and oncology). All clinics share a comprehensive electronic medical record (EMR) through which eligibility for a test, test ordering, results, referrals, and treatmentis ascertainable electronically. Our Center will expand by adding a Cervical Screening Process Documentation Unit (SPDU) and a Cervical Research Core. The Cervical SPDU will: 1) harness Parkland's EMR to collect accurate data on the cervical cancer screening process at multiple levels including the patient, provider, clinic, system, and health policy, and 2) securely transfer de-identified data to the Statistical Coordinating Center, investigators in             the Cervical Research Core will provide intellectual leadership to the PROSPR network by prioritizing, conceptualizing, and conducting collaborative projects that capitalize on the heterogeneity of the network with respect to patient population, health system, and context. Data contributed by the Parkland-UT Southwestern PROSPR Center to the Network will enable analyses that examine how recent changes in guidelines and newly available screening and vaccine technologies impact long-standing disparities in cervical cancer. This research will improve both the science and delivery of effective cervical cancer screening.         Public Health Relevance: Assessing effectiveness of cervical cancer screening in safety-net settings is important because urban, uninsured, low SES minorities have higher incidence and mortality rates. The PROSPR network needs multilevel data on this underserved population to discover what can be done to impact disparities.                ",Parkland-UT Southwestern PROSPR Center Colon Cancer Screening in a Safety net,8791367,U54CA163308,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Colon ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Goals ', ' Gynecology ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Insurance ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Woman ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Process Measure ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cervical ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policies ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' dyscrasia ', ' Dysplasia ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' statistical center ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' vaccine testing ', ' vaccine screening ', ' vaccine evaluation ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' working group ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' charity care ', ' safety net ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' screening ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' ']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,U54,2014,649344,0.24551899330188026
"Exploring Sociodemographic and Behavioral Factors Underlying Racial/Ethnic Dispar     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Through my doctoral and post-doctoral training, I have a broad background in cancer epidemiology, with specific training and expertise in nutrition. As a doctoral student at Yale University, I analyzed data from a large multicenter case-control study of esophageal and gastric cancers. As part of this study, I examined dietary and lifestyle risk factors, including the use of novel statistical approaches such as principle components analysis and classification and regression tree analysis. During my time at Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM), I analyzed data from the National Breast Screening Study (NBSS) where I examined the roles of various lifestyle and medical risk factors for numerous cancer outcomes. As a result of these experiences, I am aware of the importance of developing and maintaining successful collaborations through frequent communication among project members and of constructing a realistic research plan and timeline. My past training has provided me with the initial tools to conduct epidemiologic studies and led to my deep interest in racial/ethnic disparities in cancer outcomes. However, I lack the breadth of knowledge in three areas (Social Epidemiology, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Spatial Analyses) necessary to conduct and lead multidisciplinary studies of cancer prevention behaviors and cancer disparities. Further, due to lack of research mentoring opportunities at my current institution, an my heavy teaching load, my development as an independent researcher in this area has been limited.             To accomplish my career goal of becoming an independent investigator, and a recognized expert in the disparities in cancer outcomes, I am proposing a career development plan in which I will expand my training through coursework in social epidemiology, health disparities, and spatial analysis as well as through guided readings, regular meetings with mentors and consultants, center visits, and attendance at selected seminars, and conferences. I will be working with an outstanding mentoring team, including Drs. Demissie and Bandera (both at UMDNJ) and Dr. Jones (Yale University), all of whom are experts in the field of cancer prevention and control and health disparities and who have extensive experience mentoring masters and doctoral level students and junior faculty. The Department of Epidemiology at UMDNJ engages in a number of epidemiology activities, courses, and seminars, (www.umdnj.edu) including activities at the School of Public Health, the Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities (IEHD), and the Cancer Institute of New Jersey. Dr. Demissie, as Director of IEHD, and Dr. Bandera's work with CINJ, will also provide great opportunities for intellectual interactions and future collaborations with both of these institutes. In addition, we have identified a number of consultants, including Dr. Yu, who is at my home institution, who will provide training and assistance in GIS, Dr. Palmer who will provide assistance in recruiting participants from SNAP-Ed and EFNEP, Dr. Dubin who will provide expertise and assistance in statistical methodology and Drs. Natale-Periera and Echeverria who will provide expertise in health disparities and social epidemiology. During the entire period of the award, my department chair and college Dean, have agreed to provide substantial support to devote at least 9 person months (75% full-time professional effort) to develop my research program, which includes limiting my teaching load, supporting my salary that goes above and beyond the $100,000 cap for K awards, reducing my responsibility to represent the Department in College and University committees, and providing me with necessary resources including, office space, secretarial support, graduate student support, and access to computer support and library services.             The proposed K01 Career Development Award will also allow the development of an epidemiologic research program in Cancer Disparities in New Jersey. Breast and cervical cancer are leading causes of cancer for women in the United States, respectively and racial/ethnic disparities in diagnosis and mortality are well noted in the literature. These disparities are explained, in part, by unequal access to cancer screening across socioeconomic and racial groups, however little is known about the impact of perception of access to cancer screening on cancer screening behaviors. This study will assess the association between race/ethnicity, perceived access to screening, and individual-level socioeconomic (SES) and demographic factors and area-level characteristics, including SES, availability of low- or no-cost cervical cancer screening and mammography, on screening behavior using a cross-sectional study of low-income women enrolled in the New Jersey Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - Education (SNAP-Ed) or Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Programs (EFNEP). Multivariate models will examine the individual and joint effects of geographic and perceived access on adherence to breast and cervical cancer screening guidelines, after adjusting for individual- and area-level characteristics. These findings will serve to examine the complex interaction between socioeconomic status and health behaviors, how they differ between non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White and Hispanics, in New Jersey, which has one of the highest cancer rates in the nation. This project will also serve to develop preliminary data to support an R01 application proposing to conduct a larger scale study, and possibly, an intervention to address these issues in this community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These findings will add to literature exploring the complex interaction between individual- and area-level measures of access to cancer screening and screening behaviors among low-income women, and how they differ between non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, and Hispanic populations in New Jersey.",Exploring Sociodemographic and Behavioral Factors Underlying

"Sexual Health Empowerment for Cervical Health Literacy and Cancer Prevention  ABSTRACT Women in the criminal justice system are four-five times as likely to have cervical cancer compared to non- incarcerated women. In our previous research, we found that the most important contributor to cervical cancer risk, and perhaps lack of follow-up, is incarcerated women's low health literacy about broader reproductive health issues. Until we effectively address incarcerated women's unique reproductive health literacy needs, the cervical cancer health disparity between incarcerated and non-incarcerated women will persist. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a sexual health empowerment (SHE Project) intervention to improve cervical health knowledge, reduce barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, improve self-efficacy for navigating providers and health care systems, and ultimately work towards preventing cervical cancer. This objective is responsive to PAR-10-133 in that it develops an intervention strategy to address health literacy and broader health outcomes in a vulnerable population. To meet the objectives of this study, we propose to assess the impact of a sexual health empowerment intervention (SHE Project) on cervical health knowledge, barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, and self-efficacy for screening and follow-up among women leaving jail. More specifically, we will conduct a pre- and post-intervention assessment from baseline to the end of a weeklong intervention using a wait-list control design. Next, we will use a three-year observational study design employing both survey and ethnographic methods for follow-up, to understand how knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, and other factors change post-release cervical health prevention behaviors over time. This approach will allow us to observe the extent to which women translate, if at all, increased knowledge, reduced barriers, and increased self-efficacy into practice during clinical encounters, or if other factors explain health behaviors over time. The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for this high risk and vulnerable group of women. Our development of an effective and easily disseminated health literacy intervention that can be adapted to many health conditions and broader cancer prevention efforts in institutionalized populations (jails, prisons, community corrections, military institutions) will have an impact on public health, and also on the science of developing effective health literacy interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for the high risk and vulnerable group of women in the criminal justice system. An empowerment approach to health literacy interventions will also have an impact on broader reproductive health problems in this high risk population. Further, the development of an effective and easily disseminated health literacy intervention that can be adapted to many health conditions and broader cancer prevention efforts in institutionalized populations (jails, prisons, community corrections, military institutions) will have an impact on public health, and also on the science of developing effective health literacy interventions.            ",Sexual Health Empowerment for Cervical Health Literacy and Cancer Prevention,8704096,R01CA181047,"['Accounting ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Life Experience ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Literacy Programs ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Prisons ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Survey Method ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Reproductive Health ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' health knowledge ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' empowerment ', ' Prevention ', ' reproductive ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Jail ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' post intervention ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' ethnographic method ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' health empowerment ', ' high risk ', ' sexual violence ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2014,326075,0.0707219705959884
"A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among Pacific Islander Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among PI Women ABSTRACT Despite the fact that cervical cancer is one of the most preventable of cancers, it remains one of the top five causes of cancer deaths in the U.S. and in California. The Pap test has been shown to be effective in not only detecting cancer but also precancerous cells. Even with the introduction of HPV testing and vaccines, Pap tests represent an important cervical cancer prevention and early detection method for women in this country. Unfortunately, the Pap test is severely underutilized among many ethnic and racial populations, including Pacific Islanders (PIs) who have high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality data among specific PI ethnic groups is sparse, with available information underscoring significant cancer health disparities. In California as in the Pacific, cervical cancer is one of the top five causes of cancer deaths. Given the dearth of PI researchers and studies at the NIH level, community-based participatory research (CBPR) holds the potential for engaging community cultural experts alongside cancer health disparities researchers to address their pressing cervical cancer detection needs. This five year cluster unit randomized trial will develop and evaluate a social support intervention targeting both men and women to increase Pap testing decision making and behavior among Chamorro, Samoan and Tongan women age 18-65 years old in Southern California. We aim to: 1. Apply CBPR principles and processes for community/university partners throughout the grant period; 2. Develop and pretest two gender-specific and culturally tailored educational interventions for PI women and men. The interventions will be conducted separately by gender, and will employ a video, flipchart, and brochure, along with small-group discussions facilitated by gender-matched community health educators; 3. Develop and validate instruments measuring men's social support (provided), women's social support (perceived) and women's decision making utility; 4. Recruit and randomly assign community-based organizational samples and recruit and follow the cohorts of PI females and males in the intervention and control groups 5. Examine the associations that test the conceptual model regarding social support, decision making utility, and Pap testing intentions and behaviors; 6. Follow the cohort of PI women and men in the intervention vs. control groups to assess the impact of the intervention. Using a longitudinal cohort design, we will identify, recruit, and randomly assign PI members of churches and other community-based organizations to one of two intervention options: a) a culturally tailored social support intervention group for women and men consisting of community health educator-facilitated video, flipchart and brochure; or b) a usual care control group, consisting of pre-existing cancer education materials (brochures) for PI women and men delivered by community health educators. We posit that the planned social support intervention will increase men's provision, and women's perceptions, of Pap testing social support, leading to increases in women's prioritization of Pap testing decision making utility and Pap testing behaviors. The proposed study team involves long-standing university and community collaborators, and uses a multiple PI model to institutionalize shared participation and leadership structures. The community side of this CBPR study includes three CBOs with years of experience in health promotion, disease prevention, and collaborative research for their respective PI populations. The university side includes experienced behavioral scientists in CBPR, cancer control and decision making with multiethnic populations. This study will add to the existing science of cancer health disparities by adapting and applying well-established behavioral theories to understand the ways in which collectivist-oriented interventions influence individual women's cancer screening behavioral changes. Furthermore, this study will illuminate the CBPR engagement aspects necessary to conduct rigorous intervention research in small-size populations. The product of this study will be a culturally-tailored intervention that holds the potential to become a model for other collectivistic populations. Strengths of this study include: i) a focus on a major cancer health disparity; ii) development and testing of methods that are applicable to other health disparities; iii) a theoretical focus on decision making (a priority area for NCI regarding translational research); iv) an intervention approach that investigates and develops new strategies to improve cultural tailoring and evaluation; v) a focus on men; and vi) an ethnically diverse team of community and university investigators with an established track record in CBPR research.     A Pap Test Intervention to Enhance Decision Making among Pacific Islander Women  Project Narrative   Pacific Islanders (PIs) experience some of the highest cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in  the U.S., yet little research exists on the ways to address and ameliorate their cancer health disparities.

"South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities DESCRIPTION: South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities. The objective of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities (SUCCESS) is to establish a regional center addressing the unequal burden of cervical cancer in Miami Dade-County. SUCCESS will build on Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) relationships which we have established with Haitians in the city of Miami and Hispanics in the city of Hialeah. We will also partner with a 3rd multi ethnic less urban community located in the southern unincorporated Miami-Dade. Recognizing this as a very medically underserved area, our community partners selected this as our 3rd site. Our multiple PI leadership  team includes two investigators from the University of Miami's (UM) Departments of Medicine and   Epidemiology, both members of the UM Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. The third PI directs a large network of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). In partnership with three local FQHCs,  SUCCESS will to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment. Building on these findings and existing community partnerships we will conduct cancer outreach tailored to the unique needs of each community. Our major research project is a randomized study among 600 women in our three communities who have not been adequately screened for cervical cancer. At each site, one third of the women would be exposed to standard NCI approved outreach interventions and a second group will receive a comprehensive home based CHW intervention encouraging women to have Pap Smear testing at one of the three FQHCs. While CHWs are a promising approach, many women exposed to this intervention remain unscreened. Thus we propose a third approach in which women at each site receive the CHW intervention but also have the option of screening through HPV testing done via home based self-sampling. Our experience in Little Haiti is that by coupling this innovative molecular technology with a CHW led culturally tailored approach nearly all women agree to be screened. The SUCCESS pilot project will be led by one of our minority junior faculty. Through a pre-post test design, she will examine the impact of a CHW led educational curriculum that has been specifically tailored women who are HIV positive. Lastly, our training core will develop formal seminars in health disparities research and CBPR for twelve clinical fellows and post-doctoral trainees and provide a more intensive longitudinal practicum and mentorship on community-based participatory research to four early stage investigators including a preparing a CBPR grant proposal. The vision of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities.(SUCCESS) is that through increased cervical cancer screening we could eliminate cervical cancer health disparities in our local community. To do so, SUCCESS will utilize the Community Based Participatory Research approach to reduce disparities through a combination of outreach, research and training. Our project will target Haitians, Hispanics and African Americans in three medically underserved communities in Miami-Dade County.",South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities,8921512,U54CA153705,"['neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Florida ', ' Haiti ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Leadership ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Woman ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' County ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' Staging ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Molecular ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Coupling ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based participatory research ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2014,100000,0.09237841657343213
"Addressing Cervical Cancer Disparity in South Florida CBPR in Action     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities, also known as SUCCESS, supports a number of campus-community partnerships, or Community Advisory Groups (CAGs), throughout the Miami metropolitan area. Such partnerships were conceived in the spirit of Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) and facilitate meaningful collaboration between University investigators and community stakeholders in addressing issues of health disparity. The proposed project focuses on cervical cancer, a topic of significant health concern for three communities served by SUCCESS: Little Haiti, Hialeah, and West Perrine. Like other predominately minority, low-income  neighborhoods across the United States, these communities contribute to excess  cervical cancer incidence and mortality, largely due to lack of access to routine Pap  smear screening and timely follow up for detected abnormalities. SUCCESS aims to address this disparity. For the past three years, we have been engaged in a community trial comparing two innovative modalities for disease prevention: navigation to Pap smear screening at local Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) vs. home-based self-sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV), the principal cause of cervical cancer.  In both arms, Community Health Workers (CHWs) play a critical role in intervention delivery. However, our preliminary data indicate that CHW involvement may matter less than the method of screening itself. Screening uptake is significantly higher among women randomized to self-sampling in all three communities, likely given the ease of use and participant preference for home-based screening, which circumvents structural and cultural barriers to care. The proposed study will formally test the significance of CHW participation by comparing self-sampling provided by a CHW with self-sampling provided by mail. We will implement a two-arm study of 700 women from across our three target communities, with the CHW-self sampling intervention serving as our control group, or arm. Our primary aim is 1) to determine which method of self-sampling results in a greater proportion of women screened. Secondary outcomes include comparisons  of a) knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about cervical cancer and the importance of early  detection of disease~ b) access to care (health insurance, having a usual source of care,  and visit to provider in six months), particularly among women having abnormal screens  and requiring medical intervention~ and the c) relative cost of the two intervention  strategies. Consistent with the tenets of CBPR, the focus and scope of such work was informed by the SUCCESS CAGs in Little Haiti, Hialeah, and West Perrine.  By enlisting community leadership in study conceptualization, we ensure that we can successfully achieve our intended goal, to identify the most optimal strategy for cervical cancer prevention among women who disproportionately contribute to disease incidence and mortality.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cervical cancer disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minorities, recent immigrants, and low-income individuals.  The proposed project aims to address this disparity through a Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) initiative that tests two innovative methods for disease prevention. Consistent with the tenets of CBPR, the focus of this effort reflects community input and is grounded in community members' preferences for health and disease prevention.              ",Addressing Cervical Cancer Disparity in South Florida CBPR in Action,8660966,R01CA183612,"['Abbreviations ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Florida ', ' Goals ', ' Haiti ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Home Visits ', ' House Call ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Leadership ', ' Mails ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Printing ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Ensure ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' metropolitan ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Community Trial ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' home visit ', ' Home visitation ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' trial comparing ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' arm ', ' two-arm trial ', ' two-arm study ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2014,518331,0.1889261132974117
"Cervical, Anal & Oral HPV Persistence/Adolescent Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Adolescents and young women have the highest rates of cervical HPV, including infection with the HPV types causing significant morbidity and mortality. Introduction of the FDA-approved quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil(R), Merck & Co.) targeting HPV16 and HPV18 (high-risk [HR] types present in >65% of cervical cancers), as well as HPV6 and 11 (associated with most genital warts), has the potential to reduce the burden of genital HPV and disease. HPV vaccine clinical trials focused exclusively on low-risk women with limited numbers of sexual partners who were highly compliant with the vaccine schedule; these females were not representative of those most at risk to suffer from HPV-related disease. In fact, Hispanic and African-American women have the highest and second highest incidence rates of cervical cancer in the U.S., respectively, and high mortality rates from cervical cancer. In addition, the associations of HPV-related anal and/or oropharyngeal lesions are an important public health concern, yet few vaccine studies in women have evaluated HPV at these sites. Subsequent to the approval and release of GARDASIL, we initiated a prospective cohort study of sexually- active, inner-city, minority adolescent women attending the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center (MSAHC), the largest comprehensive adolescent primary care facility in the U.S. To date, this project has enrolled more than 750 sexually active teens between the ages of 12-19. Prevalent HPV infection at enrollment was detected in 54% of cervical, 42% of anal and 20% of oral specimens, with vaccine types (HPV 6/11, 16 & 18) present in 7%, 6% and 1% of adolescents, respectively. Adolescents who had three doses were at significantly reduced risk of HPV vaccine types in the cervix compared to those who had no vaccination. With respect to extracervical sites, non-significant reductions were observed for HR-HPV vaccine types in the anal and oral cavities when comparing fully vaccinated to non-vaccinated adolescents. There was considerable incident (4.2 per 100 person years) detection of cervical HPV 16/18 infection not present at enrollment despite vaccination; this observed rate is substantially above that reported in the efficacy trials. We propose to address the health disparities of HPV in minority young women by continuing our cohort study of high-risk adolescent females participating in an HPV immunization program at MSAHC. We propose to extend the prospective follow-up (with repeat visits every 6 months) to evaluate the long-term burden of infection and to increase sample size to just over 1,400 subjects to improve statistical power. The increased sample size and longer follow-up will allow us to determine risk factors for break-through HPV infections, as well as integrate a new aim to evaluate psychosocial elements of adolescent development and high-risk behaviors in teens. Data obtained from this study will be essential to understanding the 'real-world' impact of HPV vaccination in this group not studied in the vaccine trials and will provide the biological underpinnings for future HPV and cervical cancer screening practices, as well as estimating the potential impact of vaccine on anal and/or oropharyngeal HPV infections.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescents and young women have the highest rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, including infection with the HPV types causing high-grade neoplasia, cervical and anal cancer. This study investigates the continued burden of HPV in a population of high-risk, predominantly Hispanic and African-American inner- city adolescent women not previously included in the large randomized clinical trials of the HPV vaccine. This study will provide information that is critical to the proper design of screening and preventive strategies in populations that are at the highest risk for HPV-associated diseases despite vaccination.            ","Cervical, Anal & Oral HPV Persistence/Adolescent Girls",8582058,R01AI072204,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Age ', ' Antibodies ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Venereal Warts ', ' Genital Warts ', ' Condylomata Acuminata ', ' Condyloma Accuminata ', ' Anogenital venereal warts ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Elements ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Infection ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"HPV Infection among Sexual Minority Women in the United States ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States (US), and infections can cause a range of adverse health outcomes among females, including several types of cancer (e.g., cervical cancer) and anogenital warts. Women are at risk for HPV infection regardless of their sexual orientation since HPV can be transmitted between female sexual partners, and many sexual minority women (i.e., women with a history of sex with women or who identify as non-heterosexual) have current or past male sexual partners from whom they could have acquired HPV. Our long-term goal is to develop and test an HPV and cervical cancer prevention intervention for sexual minority women, and our preliminary research shows that a preferred intervention component is targeted information about the prevalence HPV infection among sexual minority women. However, epidemiological data on HPV infection (genital and oral) among this population are currently lacking. Further, to date, no research has examined how the prevalence of HPV infection may differ across dimensions of sexual orientation, including sexual behavior (i.e., having sex with male or female partners) and sexual identity (i.e., considering oneself lesbian, bisexual, etc.). Such differences will have important implications for communicating information in our future intervention. We propose to address the existing research gaps by conducting secondary analyses of laboratory-verified HPV infection data among a population-based sample from the 2003-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The proposed study, ""HPV Infection among Sexual Minority Women in the United States,"" will be the most comprehensive examination to date on HPV infection among sexual minority women, a hard-to-reach and understudied population at risk for health disparities. Aim 1 will provide robust data on the prevalence of genital HPV infection and differences across two dimensions of sexual orientation (i.e., sexual behavior and sexual identity). Such data are critical to women's knowledge about and perceived risk of HPV, which can in turn affect health behaviors. Aim 2 will identify determinants of genital HPV infection among sexual minority women, which will be key to our future intervention by identifying subgroups of sexual minority women at particularly high risk of HPV infection. Aim 3 will provide novel data on the prevalence of oral HPV infection among sexual minority women, which is important given the link between oral HPV infection and oral sex. Results from this study will provide needed robust data on HPV infection among sexual minority women, which will be a critical component of our future HPV and cervical cancer prevention intervention for this population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sexual minority women (i.e., women with a history of sex with women or who identify as non-heterosexual) are at risk for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-related disease, yet little is known about the prevalence of HPV infection among these women. The proposed study will be the most comprehensive examination to date on genital and oral HPV infection among sexual minority women. Findings will provide invaluable data for an HPV and cervical cancer prevention intervention for sexual minority women.                ",HPV Infection among Sexual Minority Women in the United States,8950564,R03CA198115,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Infection ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Laboratories ', ' male ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vaccines ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' vulvar ', ' Vulva ', ' Woman ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Cervical ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Lesbian ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Oral Sex ', ' Smoker ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' HPV infection ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Oral ', ' Pattern ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' oral pharyngeal ', ' Oropharynxs ', ' Oropharynx ', ' Oropharyngeal ', ' urogenital system (genital part) ', ' Genital ', ' Genital system ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Genital Human papillomavirus Infection ', ' Genital Human Papilloma Virus Infection ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' High risk Human papilloma virus ', ' High risk Human Papillomavirus ', ' High risk HPV ', ' High Risk Oncogenic HPV ', ' HPV-High Risk ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer type ', ' Oncogenic ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' initiation of sexual activity ', ' sexual debut ', ' sexual minority ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' LGBTI ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' ']",NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2015,77000,0.08934681787436127
"Etiology of cervical cancer health disparity in American Indian women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in women worldwide. American Indian (AI) women living on the Northern Plains have a greater incidence of cervical cancer and suffer from a higher mortality rate. Our recent studies have shown that AI women have more than twice the incidence of HPV infection and that HPV positive AI women have a two times higher likelihood of having abnormal PAP tests than HPV positive Caucasian women; suggesting underlying causes which increase HPV pathology. One potential cofactor may be smoke exposure and its effects on the host immune response and HPV oncogenesis. Our data indicate that 4 times more AI women smoke as compared to Caucasian women and the majority of HPV positive AI women smoke. While smoking is a recognized risk factor for cervical cancer, the molecular interactions between HPV and smoke compounds are unknown. Our laboratory has recently shown that smoke carcinogen Benzo[a]Pyrene (BaP) increases the expression of HPV oncoproteins, suggesting a direct molecular link between HPV infection and exposure to smoke. We have also identified that curcumin, a natural anti-cancer compound, effectively inhibits the expression of HPV oncoproteins. Based on this compelling evidence, we hypothesize that exposure to tobacco smoke synergizes with HPV infection and increases the incidence and severity of cervical cancer in American Indian women by increasing the expression of HPV oncoproteins (E6/E7) and modulating cellular/humoral immune responses. Additionally, we hypothesize that curcumin or nanocurcumin may be effective methods for the repression of HPV infection in AI women. We propose to 1) investigate novel mechanisms of synergy between HPV infection, BaP and the development of cervical cancer, 2) evaluate the efficacy of curcumin/nanocurcumin to suppress HPV oncogene expression in preclinical and clinical settings, and 3) to investigate the effect of smoke exposure on cervical immune responses. The results of this study will provide information regarding underlying etiological factors that are responsible for cervical cancer health disparity in AI women and will ultimately reduce the burden of cervical cancer.

"HPV Vaccination among Low-Income Hispanic Adolescents DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is a safe and effective primary prevention strategy for cervical cancer and other anogenital cancers, yet vaccination rates are remarkably low. Only 53% of adolescent females have initiated the vaccine (received ¿1 dose). More importantly, far fewer (35%) have completed the 3-dose series, which is vital for effective cancer prevention. Moreover, there are growing disparities in HPV vaccine completion rates, with Hispanic females significantly less likely to complete the series than non-Hispanic Whites. Low rates of vaccine completion are of crucial concern for populations disproportionally affected by HPV-related disease such as Latinas, whose cervical cancer incidence rates are 60% higher than in non- Hispanic Whites. Although studies have examined predictors of HPV vaccine initiation, there is a fundamental gap in the literature about predictors of series completion. Because receipt of all 3 doses is essential for maximum protection against HPV, identifying factors that influence whether Hispanic adolescents complete the series is critical for informing future intervention efforts. The long-term goal of ths research program is to develop effective strategies for increasing HPV vaccine completion among low-income Hispanic adolescents, thereby reducing morbidity, mortality, and disparities associated with HPV-related disease. The objective of this application is to determine key predictors of HPV vaccine completion, with special emphasis on identifying modifiable psychosocial and cultural factors associated with completion of the series. We propose two specific aims: (1) Determine key predictors of HPV vaccine completion (receipt of all 3 doses) among low-income Latina mothers of adolescents who have received the first dose of HPV vaccine and (2) Provide complementary qualitative information about facilitators and barriers that play an important role in HPV vaccine completion. To achieve Aim 1 we will conduct a yearlong longitudinal study of low-income Latina mothers whose adolescent daughter/son initiates the HPV vaccine. At baseline, both mothers and their daughter/son (aged 9-17) will complete a survey to assess cultural (e.g., acculturation) and psychosocial factors (e.g., perceived barriers to completion, subjective norms for completing the series) from major theories of health behavior (Health Belief Model, Theory of Planned Behavior). These variables will be used to predict our primary outcome variable: HPV vaccine completion status, as verified by the child's medical record. To achieve Aim 2 we will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of mothers from the longitudinal study. The goal of these interviews is to provide greater insight into cultural/psychosocial factors associated with completion, to identify factors related to completion not reflected in traditional theories of health behavior, an to investigate factors that may arise after mothers complete the baseline assessment. Outcomes from this project are expected to have an important positive impact by advancing knowledge needed to develop effective strategies for increasing HPV vaccine completion rates among low-income Hispanic adolescents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination can prevent certain types of cancers, yet studies suggest that most adolescents do not receive all three doses of the vaccine, which could leave them at risk for cancer. The goal of this project is to identify cultura and psychosocial factors that affect whether low-income Hispanic adolescents -- a group who is at increased risk for the types of cancers caused by HPV -- receive all three doses of the vaccine. Findings will be used to inform the development of future interventions aimed at increasing rates of HPV vaccine completion among low-income Hispanic adolescents.",HPV Vaccination among Low-Income Hispanic Adolescents,8829796,R21CA178592,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Daughter ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Medical Records ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mothers ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Play ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Son ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' cancer prevention ', ' infectious organism ', ' Infectious Agent ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' psychosocial ', ' cancer risk ', ' success ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' vaccine effectiveness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Anogenital cancer ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2015,141304,0.13802807797825561
"Cervical, Anal & Oral HPV Persistence/Adolescent Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Adolescents and young women have the highest rates of cervical HPV, including infection with the HPV types causing significant morbidity and mortality. Introduction of the FDA-approved quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil(R), Merck & Co.) targeting HPV16 and HPV18 (high-risk [HR] types present in >65% of cervical cancers), as well as HPV6 and 11 (associated with most genital warts), has the potential to reduce the burden of genital HPV and disease. HPV vaccine clinical trials focused exclusively on low-risk women with limited numbers of sexual partners who were highly compliant with the vaccine schedule; these females were not representative of those most at risk to suffer from HPV-related disease. In fact, Hispanic and African-American women have the highest and second highest incidence rates of cervical cancer in the U.S., respectively, and high mortality rates from cervical cancer. In addition, the associations of HPV-related anal and/or oropharyngeal lesions are an important public health concern, yet few vaccine studies in women have evaluated HPV at these sites. Subsequent to the approval and release of GARDASIL, we initiated a prospective cohort study of sexually- active, inner-city, minority adolescent women attending the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center (MSAHC), the largest comprehensive adolescent primary care facility in the U.S. To date, this project has enrolled more than 750 sexually active teens between the ages of 12-19. Prevalent HPV infection at enrollment was detected in 54% of cervical, 42% of anal and 20% of oral specimens, with vaccine types (HPV 6/11, 16 & 18) present in 7%, 6% and 1% of adolescents, respectively. Adolescents who had three doses were at significantly reduced risk of HPV vaccine types in the cervix compared to those who had no vaccination. With respect to extracervical sites, non-significant reductions were observed for HR-HPV vaccine types in the anal and oral cavities when comparing fully vaccinated to non-vaccinated adolescents. There was considerable incident (4.2 per 100 person years) detection of cervical HPV 16/18 infection not present at enrollment despite vaccination; this observed rate is substantially above that reported in the efficacy trials. We propose to address the health disparities of HPV in minority young women by continuing our cohort study of high-risk adolescent females participating in an HPV immunization program at MSAHC. We propose to extend the prospective follow-up (with repeat visits every 6 months) to evaluate the long-term burden of infection and to increase sample size to just over 1,400 subjects to improve statistical power. The increased sample size and longer follow-up will allow us to determine risk factors for break-through HPV infections, as well as integrate a new aim to evaluate psychosocial elements of adolescent development and high-risk behaviors in teens. Data obtained from this study will be essential to understanding the 'real-world' impact of HPV vaccination in this group not studied in the vaccine trials and will provide the biological underpinnings for future HPV and cervical cancer screening practices, as well as estimating the potential impact of vaccine on anal and/or oropharyngeal HPV infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescents and young women have the highest rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, including infection with the HPV types causing high-grade neoplasia, cervical and anal cancer. This study investigates the continued burden of HPV in a population of high-risk, predominantly Hispanic and African-American inner- city adolescent women not previously included in the large randomized clinical trials of the HPV vaccine. This study will provide information that is critical to the proper design of screening and preventive strategies in populations that are at the highest risk for HPV-associated diseases despite vaccination.","Cervical, Anal & Oral HPV Persistence/Adolescent Girls",8771413,R01AI072204,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Age ', ' Antibodies ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Venereal Warts ', ' Genital Warts ', ' Condylomata Acuminata ', ' Condyloma Accuminata ', ' Anogenital venereal warts ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Elements ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Infection ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Comparative and Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing HPV-Related Diseases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, more than 25,000 cases of invasive cancer attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection occur in the United States; nearly 50% are cervical cancer, while the rest involve the oral cavity/oropharynx, anus, vulva, penis, and vagina. Collectively, these account for substantial morbidity and mortality, contribute to health disparities, and are associated with high economic costs. Advancements in HPV-related cancer epidemiology, coupled with new (e.g., HPV-16,-18 vaccines, HPV DNA testing) and emerging (e.g., biomarkers, therapeutic vaccines) technologies provide a remarkable opportunity to improve cancer prevention efforts. However, critical challenges remain with respect to clinical decision-making and prevention policy, pertaining to knowledge gaps and heterogeneities in the natural history of different cancers, uncertainties in HPV type distribution following HPV-16,-18 vaccination, and the real-world clinical effectiveness of emerging technologies. We propose to employ a decision-analytic approach, developing a flexible modeling framework that will allow us to synthesize the best available data; evaluate the health and economic consequences of alternative strategies; explore the uncertainty around their outcomes; explicitly quantify the tradeoffs associated with different approaches; and inform timely clinical and policy questions. By achieving our aims, we expect to have an impact on (1) the analytic methods of decision science; (2) the equitable distribution and rationale use of new technology; (3) the effectiveness of strategies for cancer prevention through clinical guidelines and national policies; (4) HPV-related cancer outcomes, including reduced incidence, enhanced quality of life, improved survival, and reduced disparities; and (5) the financial and economic profile of delivering cancer-related health services. Rapid advances in the fields of HPV-related cancer epidemiology and medical technology present opportunities to revolutionize the approach to cancer prevention in the U.S. but have outpaced the ability of policy makers to make informed decisions regarding optimal adoption of health interventions. In this project, we propose to develop a flexible modeling framework that will enable us to synthesize the best available data on HPV, provide insight into the comparative and cost-effectiveness of different strategies, and assist in informed public health and clinical decision-making with respect to prevention of HPV-related cancers.",Comparative and Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing HPV-Related Diseases,8836495,R01CA160744,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Calibration ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' penis ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Medical Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' virology ', ' vulvar ', ' Vulva ', ' Woman ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Anus ', ' Malignant Anal Tumor ', ' Malignant Anal Neoplasm ', ' Anus Cancer ', ' Anal Cancers ', ' Anal Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of anus ', ' Penis Cancer ', ' Penile Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Penis ', ' Malignant Penile Tumor ', ' Malignant Penile Neoplasm ', ' Malignant neoplasm of penis ', ' Guidelines ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' insight ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Disease Progression ', ' cancer prevention ', ' therapeutic vaccine ', ' tool ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' HPV infection ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' oral pharyngeal ', ' Oropharynxs ', ' Oropharynx ', ' Oropharyngeal ', ' interest ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Structure ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' economic cost ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' type 16 Human papillomavirus ', ' type 16 Human papilloma virus ', ' human papilloma virus 16 ', ' Human papillomavirus type 16 ', ' Human papilloma virus type 16 ', ' HPV16 ', ' HPV-16 ', ' HPV 16 ', ' Human papillomavirus 16 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preventive ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' attributable fraction ', ' Population Attributable Risks ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Premalignant ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Validation ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Oncogenic ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' comparative ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' population health ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' ']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2015,308121,0.13033386487219234
"A Text Message Intervention to Increase HPV Vaccine Completion in Young Latinas     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Angelica Roncancio, Ph.D. is a motivated postdoctoral fellow, trained as a behavioral scientist, who is currently working at the Center for Health Promotion and Prevention Research at the University of Texas Health Science Center Houston (UTHSC-H) School of Public Health. The overall goal of this NCI K01 career development proposal is to provide Dr. Roncancio with the additional research skills necessary to launch an independent career focused on reducing HPV-related cancer disparities among Latinas. Dr. Roncancio's research examines the psychosocial and cultural determinants of cervical-cancer screening and HPV vaccination among Latinas and seeks to modify health behavior through innovative approaches to screening and vaccination completion. Under the mentorship of Dr. Maria Fernandez she will receive specialized, mentored training in the following areas: 1) cancer disparities in Latino populations, 2) the development of theory-based interventions, and 3) the use of technology in health promotion.          UTHSC-H's rich training environment provides junior investigators with the resources necessary to become independent, productive, and highly successful researchers. For example, it provides outstanding opportunities for developing skills in grant writing, manuscript publication, and project management. UTHSC-H also offers a large variety of courses, workshops, and seminars relevant to public health and behavioral science, along with access to some of the most renowned prevention scientists in cancer research.          Dr. Roncancio's long-term career goal as an independent health researcher is to improve both cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination rates, ultimately aiding in the reduction of cervical cancer disparity in Latinas. She will develop a research program focused on the development and implementation of innovative, culturally appropriate, theory-based interventions to increase cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination among underserved Latinas.          In addition, Dr. Roncancio outlines four short term goals to be achieved throughout the award period that will serve as the foundation for an independent research career: 1) to increase her science-based knowledge in behavioral theory and its application to the development of cancer interventions for underserved populations, particularly Latinas; 2) to increase her knowledge in the use of technology in interventions targeted at hard-to- reach underserved populations; 3) to increase experience in implementing interventions in hard-to-reach populations; and 4) to participate in professional development activities related to cancer health disparities. These goals will be achieved through a combination of formal coursework and directed readings, experience in implementing several research projects, experience in developing and publishing manuscripts, and intensive mentoring to ensure that Dr. Roncancio achieves each of her specific short term goals and becomes a successful independent cervical cancer disparities researcher.          The aims of the proposed research are to: 1) develop an Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction (IM) that explains Spanish-speaking Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series, and 2) develop and pilot test an innovatively-delivered IM-based intervention (via video text messaging) for Spanish-speaking Latino mothers to encourage HPV vaccine series completion for their adolescent daughters. This research is both important and timely given the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer's 2012 recommendation to increase HPV vaccination efforts to combat the rise in incidence rates of some HPV-associated cancers and the finding that Latino adolescent girls are less likely non-Latino white adolescent girls to complete the HPV vaccine series.          The proposed aims will be accomplished through four successive plans of study: 1) a qualitative study to identify the beliefs that underlie Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series; 2) a longitudinal study to identify the associations between the IM predictor variables, intentions, and behavior; 3) a usability study to evaluate the acceptability and appropriateness of the video texts to be delivered to the mothers' cellular phones that were developed to increase HPV vaccine series completion; and 4) a longitudinal pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a theory-based intervention that uses video text messaging as an innovative channel of delivery.

"Determinants of HPV vaccination for Hispanic parents from the Texas-Mexico border DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic women along the Texas-Mexico border experience more cases of and deaths from cervical cancer compared to the nation. Cervical cancer is preventable using the HPV vaccine, which is recommended for girls/boys and women/men aged 11-26. Compared to U.S. Hispanic girls, a smaller proportion of Texas Hispanic girls (ages 13-17) (65% vs. 58%) receive �1 dose HPV vaccine and fewer complete the vaccine series (�3 doses; 42% vs. 35%). Given the cervical cancer disparities in incidence and death among Hispanic women in this area, it is of great public health importance to promote the adoption of the vaccine and compliance with its dosing schedule. The objective of this research plan is to examine determinants of Hispanic mothers' intention to vaccinate and actual initiation and completion of the three dose series for their daughter aged 11-17. The proposed research plan seeks to: (1) identify determinants of mothers' HPV vaccine intentions, initiation and completion; (2) understand providers' perspectives on recommending the vaccine; and (3) design a culturally-relevant, theoretically grounded HPV intervention for low-income, Hispanics mothers along the Texas-Mexico border. The research is innovative because it: (1) focuses on a on a largely underserved, vulnerable population with specific needs; (2) assesses the feasibility of a clinic-based, cervical cancer prevention intervention for Hispanics mothers; and (3) focuses on the interpersonal communication between the parent, the child, and the provider. Achievement of the aims will contribute further evidence regarding the critical role of parents and providers in increasing HPV vaccine uptake and completion among girls to eliminate cervical cancer disparities among this population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a critical need to understand why there is less than optimal uptake of the HPV vaccine among Hispanic girls along the Texas-Mexico border, despite the high cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates for Hispanic women in this area. The purpose of this research is to understanding the determinants for parental intentions and acceptance of HPV vaccination and factors influencing provider's intention to recommend vaccination.

"Increasing HPV Vaccine Coverage among Young Adult Gay and Bisexual Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gay and bisexual men have high rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-related disease (e.g., anal cancer) compared to the general population. HPV vaccination is a promising strategy for reducing these existing disparities, as routine HPV vaccination is recommended for young gay and bisexual men (YGBM) through age 26. However, little research has addressed HPV vaccination among YGBM, and no interventions we are aware of have been developed specifically for this high-risk population. To address this important research gap, we conducted a national survey of YGBM ages 18-26 in late 2013. Only about 13% of participants had received any doses of HPV vaccine, and results provided valuable information for designing an HPV vaccine intervention for YGBM. Based on results of this preliminary research, an interdisciplinary research team will conduct the proposed study, ""Increasing HPV Vaccine Coverage among Young Adult Gay and Bisexual Men."" The study will develop and pilot test a theoretically-based mobile health (mHealth) HPV vaccine intervention for YGBM that will consist of: 1) population-targeted, individually-tailored content about HPV and HPV vaccine; and 2) vaccination reminders. During pilot testing, the intervention will be compared to a control group that receives standard information about HPV and HPV vaccine via a mobile-friendly website. The study will have two primary aims and an exploratory aim. Aim 1 will develop and pilot test the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention for YGBM to establish intervention feasibility and acceptability. Feasibility will be established by meeting recruitment (n=94) and retention (85% retention over a 6-month follow-up period) goals for the pilot study, and acceptability will be established by comparing participant satisfaction with study materials between the intervention and control groups. Aim 2 will obtain preliminary efficacy data on whether the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention increases HPV vaccine initiation compared to the control group. HPV vaccine initiation (i.e., receipt of the first dose of the three-dose HPV vaccine series) will serve as the primary outcome for the pilot study. An exploratory aim will examine whether the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention affects secondary outcomes compared to the control group. Secondary outcomes will include receipt of the second and third doses of the HPV vaccine series and changes in potential mediators between study group and HPV vaccination. Results from the pilot study will establish intervention feasibility and acceptability and provide valuable preliminary data on outcomes related to HPV vaccination. These data will inform an R01 grant application to test the efficacy of the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention in a large randomized controlled trial.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will develop and pilot test a mobile health (mHealth) HPV vaccine intervention for young gay and bisexual men.

"Sexual Health Empowerment for Cervical Health Literacy and Cancer Prevention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women in the criminal justice system are four-five times as likely to have cervical cancer compared to non- incarcerated women. In our previous research, we found that the most important contributor to cervical cancer risk, and perhaps lack of follow-up, is incarcerated women's low health literacy about broader reproductive health issues. Until we effectively address incarcerated women's unique reproductive health literacy needs, the cervical cancer health disparity between incarcerated and non-incarcerated women will persist. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a sexual health empowerment (SHE Project) intervention to improve cervical health knowledge, reduce barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, improve self-efficacy for navigatin providers and health care systems, and ultimately work towards preventing cervical cancer. This objective is responsive to PAR-10-133 in that it develops an intervention strategy to address health literacy and broader health outcomes in a vulnerable population. To meet the objectives of this study, we propose to assess the impact of a sexual health empowerment intervention (SHE Project) on cervical health knowledge; barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, and self-efficacy for screening and follow-up among women leaving jail. More specifically, we will conduct a pre- and post-intervention assessment from baseline to the end of a weeklong intervention using a wait-list control design. Next, we will use a three-year observational study design employing both survey and ethnographic methods for follow-up, to understand how knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, and other factors change post-release cervical health prevention behaviors over time. This approach will allow us to observe the extent to which women translate, if at all, increased knowledge, reduced barriers, and increased self-efficacy into practice during clinical encounters, or if other factors explain health behaviors ove time. The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for this high risk and vulnerable group of women. Our development of an effective and easily disseminated health literacy intervention that can be adapted to many health conditions and broader cancer prevention efforts in institutionalized populations (jails, prisons, community corrections, military institutions) will have an impact on public health, and also on the science of developing effective health literacy interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for the high risk and vulnerable group of women in the criminal justice system. An empowerment approach to health literacy interventions will also have an impact on broader reproductive health problems in this high risk population.

"South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities DESCRIPTION: South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities. The objective of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities (SUCCESS) is to establish a regional center addressing the unequal burden of cervical cancer in Miami Dade-County. SUCCESS will build on Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) relationships which we have established with Haitians in the city of Miami and Hispanics in the city of Hialeah. We will also partner with a 3rd multi ethnic less urban community located in the southern unincorporated Miami-Dade. Recognizing this as a very medically underserved area, our community partners selected this as our 3rd site. Our multiple PI leadership  team includes two investigators from the University of Miami's (UM) Departments of Medicine and   Epidemiology, both members of the UM Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. The third PI directs a large network of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). In partnership with three local FQHCs,  SUCCESS will to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment. Building on these findings and existing community partnerships we will conduct cancer outreach tailored to the unique needs of each community. Our major research project is a randomized study among 600 women in our three communities who have not been adequately screened for cervical cancer. At each site, one third of the women would be exposed to standard NCI approved outreach interventions and a second group will receive a comprehensive home based CHW intervention encouraging women to have Pap Smear testing at one of the three FQHCs. While CHWs are a promising approach, many women exposed to this intervention remain unscreened. Thus we propose a third approach in which women at each site receive the CHW intervention but also have the option of screening through HPV testing done via home based self-sampling. Our experience in Little Haiti is that by coupling this innovative molecular technology with a CHW led culturally tailored approach nearly all women agree to be screened. The SUCCESS pilot project will be led by one of our minority junior faculty. Through a pre-post test design, she will examine the impact of a CHW led educational curriculum that has been specifically tailored women who are HIV positive. Lastly, our training core will develop formal seminars in health disparities research and CBPR for twelve clinical fellows and post-doctoral trainees and provide a more intensive longitudinal practicum and mentorship on community-based participatory research to four early stage investigators including a preparing a CBPR grant proposal. The vision of the South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities.(SUCCESS) is that through increased cervical cancer screening we could eliminate cervical cancer health disparities in our local community. To do so, SUCCESS will utilize the Community Based Participatory Research approach to reduce disparities through a combination of outreach, research and training.

"Comparative Modeling to Inform Cervical Cancer Control Policies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite successful cervical cancer screening in the United States, over 12,000 women develop and 4,000 women die from cervical cancer each year. New technologies, including screening tests and vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually-transmitted virus known to cause cervical cancer, represent tremendous opportunities for innovative and efficient cervical cancer programs in the U.S. but also pose significant challenges for decision making, due to the complex and long natural history of disease and the different time points along the disease spectrum at which interventions are applied. Consequently, policy makers are uniquely reliant on mathematical modeling to provide evidence on the optimal cervical cancer control strategies. These models can be used to integrate the most up-to-date data, extrapolate current short- term findings into long-term outcomes, and evaluate what-if scenarios that would otherwise be impractical or infeasible to conduct in clinical studies. There has been a growing number of independent mathematical models that have been developed to address clinical and policy questions with respect to cervical cancer prevention and control but no formal efforts to compare assumptions and results across models. As part of the CISNET consortium, a group of established cervical cancer modelers from the U.S., Australia, and the Netherlands will engage in a formal collaboration of comparative modeling using a series of state-of-the-art mathematical models of HPV and cervical carcinogenesis. We will pursue analyses related to the historical impact of screening, the comparative effectiveness of current and anticipated HPV vaccination and screening strategies, and optimal routes for reducing cervical cancer disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies, including screening tests and vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually- transmitted virus known to cause cervical cancer, are dramatically changing the landscape of cervical cancer prevention in the U.S. and worldwide. In order to address important evidence gaps in cervical cancer control, we have assembled five independent research teams who have been at the frontier of modeling cervical cancer prevention over the last decade to engage in formal comparative modeling, evaluate the comparative and cost-effectiveness of screening and vaccination strategies, and disseminate results to inform health policies and decision.            ",Comparative Modeling to Inform Cervical Cancer Control Policies,8969095,U01CA199334,"['Australia ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cytology ', ' Decision Making ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Kenya ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Netherlands ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' South Africa ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Uganda ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Woman ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' Country ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' disease natural history ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' vaccine testing ', ' vaccine screening ', ' vaccine evaluation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' CISNET ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' Vaccinated ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' vaccination strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' comparative ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' ']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,U01,2015,1212678,0.2797120041390384
"Exploring Sociodemographic and Behavioral Factors Underlying Racial/Ethnic Dispar DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Through my doctoral and post-doctoral training, I have a broad background in cancer epidemiology, with specific training and expertise in nutrition. As a doctoral student at Yale University, I analyzed data from a large multicenter case-control study of esophageal and gastric cancers. As part of this study, I examined dietary and lifestyle risk factors, including the use of novel statistical approaches such as principle components analysis and classification and regression tree analysis. During my time at Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM), I analyzed data from the National Breast Screening Study (NBSS) where I examined the roles of various lifestyle and medical risk factors for numerous cancer outcomes. As a result of these experiences, I am aware of the importance of developing and maintaining successful collaborations through frequent communication among project members and of constructing a realistic research plan and timeline. My past training has provided me with the initial tools to conduct epidemiologic studies and led to my deep interest in racial/ethnic disparities in cancer outcomes. However, I lack the breadth of knowledge in three areas (Social Epidemiology, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Spatial Analyses) necessary to conduct and lead multidisciplinary studies of cancer prevention behaviors and cancer disparities. Further, due to lack of research mentoring opportunities at my current institution, an my heavy teaching load, my development as an independent researcher in this area has been limited.             To accomplish my career goal of becoming an independent investigator, and a recognized expert in the disparities in cancer outcomes, I am proposing a career development plan in which I will expand my training through coursework in social epidemiology, health disparities, and spatial analysis as well as through guided readings, regular meetings with mentors and consultants, center visits, and attendance at selected seminars, and conferences. I will be working with an outstanding mentoring team, including Drs. Demissie and Bandera (both at UMDNJ) and Dr. Jones (Yale University), all of whom are experts in the field of cancer prevention and control and health disparities and who have extensive experience mentoring masters and doctoral level students and junior faculty. The Department of Epidemiology at UMDNJ engages in a number of epidemiology activities, courses, and seminars, (www.umdnj.edu) including activities at the School of Public Health, the Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities (IEHD), and the Cancer Institute of New Jersey. Dr. Demissie, as Director of IEHD, and Dr. Bandera's work with CINJ, will also provide great opportunities for intellectual interactions and future collaborations with both of these institutes. In addition, we have identified a number of consultants, including Dr. Yu, who is at my home institution, who will provide training and assistance in GIS, Dr. Palmer who will provide assistance in recruiting participants from SNAP-Ed and EFNEP, Dr. Dubin who will provide expertise and assistance in statistical methodology and Drs. Natale-Periera and Echeverria who will provide expertise in health disparities and social epidemiology. During the entire period of the award, my department chair and college Dean, have agreed to provide substantial support to devote at least 9 person months (75% full-time professional effort) to develop my research program, which includes limiting my teaching load, supporting my salary that goes above and beyond the $100,000 cap for K awards, reducing my responsibility to represent the Department in College and University committees, and providing me with necessary resources including, office space, secretarial support, graduate student support, and access to computer support and library services.             The proposed K01 Career Development Award will also allow the development of an epidemiologic research program in Cancer Disparities in New Jersey. Breast and cervical cancer are leading causes of cancer for women in the United States, respectively and racial/ethnic disparities in diagnosis and mortality are well noted in the literature. These disparities are explained, in part, by unequal access to cancer screening across socioeconomic and racial groups, however little is known about the impact of perception of access to cancer screening on cancer screening behaviors. This study will assess the association between race/ethnicity, perceived access to screening, and individual-level socioeconomic (SES) and demographic factors and area-level characteristics, including SES, availability of low- or no-cost cervical cancer screening and mammography, on screening behavior using a cross-sectional study of low-income women enrolled in the New Jersey Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - Education (SNAP-Ed) or Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Programs (EFNEP). Multivariate models will examine the individual and joint effects of geographic and perceived access on adherence to breast and cervical cancer screening guidelines, after adjusting for individual- and area-level characteristics. These findings will serve to examine the complex interaction between socioeconomic status and health behaviors, how they differ between non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White and Hispanics, in New Jersey, which has one of the highest cancer rates in the nation. This project will also serve to develop preliminary data to support an R01 application proposing to conduct a larger scale study, and possibly, an intervention to address these issues in this community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These findings will add to literature exploring the complex interaction between individual- and area-level measures of access to cancer screening and screening behaviors among low-income women, and how they differ between non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, and Hispanic populations in New Jersey.",Exploring Sociodemographic and Behavioral Factors Underlying

"Addressing Cervical Cancer Disparity in South Florida CBPR in Action DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities, also known as SUCCESS, supports a number of campus-community partnerships, or Community Advisory Groups (CAGs), throughout the Miami metropolitan area. Such partnerships were conceived in the spirit of Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) and facilitate meaningful collaboration between University investigators and community stakeholders in addressing issues of health disparity. The proposed project focuses on cervical cancer, a topic of significant health concern for three communities served by SUCCESS: Little Haiti, Hialeah, and West Perrine. Like other predominately minority, low-income  neighborhoods across the United States, these communities contribute to excess  cervical cancer incidence and mortality, largely due to lack of access to routine Pap  smear screening and timely follow up for detected abnormalities. SUCCESS aims to address this disparity. For the past three years, we have been engaged in a community trial comparing two innovative modalities for disease prevention: navigation to Pap smear screening at local Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) vs. home-based self-sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV), the principal cause of cervical cancer.  In both arms, Community Health Workers (CHWs) play a critical role in intervention delivery. However, our preliminary data indicate that CHW involvement may matter less than the method of screening itself. Screening uptake is significantly higher among women randomized to self-sampling in all three communities, likely given the ease of use and participant preference for home-based screening, which circumvents structural and cultural barriers to care. The proposed study will formally test the significance of CHW participation by comparing self-sampling provided by a CHW with self-sampling provided by mail. We will implement a two-arm study of 700 women from across our three target communities, with the CHW-self sampling intervention serving as our control group, or arm. Our primary aim is 1) to determine which method of self-sampling results in a greater proportion of women screened. Secondary outcomes include comparisons  of a) knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about cervical cancer and the importance of early  detection of disease~ b) access to care (health insurance, having a usual source of care,  and visit to provider in six months), particularly among women having abnormal screens  and requiring medical intervention~ and the c) relative cost of the two intervention  strategies. Consistent with the tenets of CBPR, the focus and scope of such work was informed by the SUCCESS CAGs in Little Haiti, Hialeah, and West Perrine.  By enlisting community leadership in study conceptualization, we ensure that we can successfully achieve our intended goal, to identify the most optimal strategy for cervical cancer prevention among women who disproportionately contribute to disease incidence and mortality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cervical cancer disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minorities, recent immigrants, and low-income individuals.  The proposed project aims to address this disparity through a Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) initiative that tests two innovative methods for disease prevention.

"Application of a syndemic framework to HPV and HSV infection in emergent adult men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human papilloma virus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections account for significant morbidity among men who have sex with men (MSM). HPV is associated with oral, oropharyngeal, and anal cancers and a growing body of research suggests that racial disparities in HIV burden may be attributable, in part, to HSV infection. Building on our ongoing cohort study (The P18 cohort study; R01DA025537) of young MSM (YMSM), we will conduct an ancillary study to incorporate a comprehensive assessment of anal and oral HPV, HSV-1, and HSV-2 across time, all of which are highly prevalent infections among YMSM. Guided by syndemic theory, we will examine the sociodemographic, biological, behavioral, psychosocial/ structural determinants of these viral infections. Our work i informed by knowledge generated from the P18 cohort study thus far, which indicates inadequate sexual health care among cohort participants, ongoing incident HIV infections (7.2% to date), and a high level of infection with bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that YMSM have a very low likelihood of initiating HPV vaccination. Understanding the epidemiology of HPV and HSV infection as well as it associated correlates and predictors will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the multiple health burdens which compromise the overall health of YMSM. Further, understanding HPV and HSV infection among YMSM may shed light on the stark racial/ethnic disparities in HIV among YMSM. The proposed ancillary study is guided by the following aims: (1a) to detect cases of oral and anal HPV infection through site-specific PCR testing and clinically significant HPV subtypes (6, 11, 16, 18) through serotyping and to estimate HPV persistence and clearance rates; (1b) to identify uptake and completion of HPV vaccination; (2a) to determine the prevalence and incidence of HSV-1 and HSV-2; (2b) to prospectively estimate HIV risk among YMSM with and without HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 and to assess whether HSV infection explains racial/ethnic disparities in HIV risk; and (3) to determine the extent to which biological, behavioral and psychosocial/structural factors explain the likelihood of (a) oral/anal HPV infection, broadly and infection of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18, specifically; (b) HPV vaccination uptake, (c) HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection, and (d) co-infections of HIV, HSV, and/or HPV. We will begin testing for HPV and HSV at our month 54 assessment and continue to test on a semi-annual basis for the duration of the study. Main analyses fall into two basic types: (1) cross-sectional analysis of correlates of HPV (overall and by subtype) and HSV-1 and HSV-2; and (2) prospective analysis of predictors of these viral STI outcomes. This study will provide much needed data on epidemiological trends of viral STIs among a racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of YMSM as well as provide further insights on the potential salience of HPV, HSV-1, and HSV-2 on HIV transmission and acquisition. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human papilloma virus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections account for significant morbidity among men who have sex with men (MSM). HPV is associated with oral, oropharyngeal, and anal cancers and a growing body of research suggests that racial disparities in HIV burden may be attributable, in part, to HSV infection.

"An HPV Health Communication Randomized Controlled Trial Intervention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Sherrie Wallington, PhD, MA, Assistant Professor of Oncology;, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC), Georgetown University (GUMC) Medical Center, Washington, DC. Dr. Wallington's chief academic and research goal is to transition to independence as a social and behavioral scientist investigating the role of health communication to address cancer health disparities.  Environment: Georgetown University's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center is a high-quality research environment and is well suited for the success of Dr. Wallington's career development experience, proposed research, and her transition to an independent scientist. In the event of an award, the institution is committed to ensuring that Dr. Wallington fulfills all the requirement of this award, as detailed in the Director's letter (see Institutional Environment component of this proposal).  Research: This proposed research emphasizes the need to increase knowledge of the human papillomavirus (HPV) and the HPV vaccine among low-income African-American mothers, a population that lacks HPV knowledge and has a high incidence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is estimated to be the most common sexually transmitted infection. High-risk HPV types can cause cervical, anal, and other genital cancers. However, public awareness and understanding of the sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses and the available HPV vaccine are low, particularly among racial ethnic minorities and women of low socioeconomic status. In the District of Columbia (DC), legislation passed in 2007 mandates that all female students enrolling in the sixth grade at a DC school must received the HPV vaccine or not received the HPV vaccine because of an opt-out clause. Many DC parents and community groups have questioned the efficacy of the vaccine, the clarity of the current opt-out form, and the failure of DC to provide a visible HPV public information campaign. DC has the highest cervical cancer rates in the United States. This lack of HPV education is leading to significant knowledge gaps and communication inequalities, particularly among minority and underserved populations, in the access to information and the inability of parents to make informed decisions with balanced and accurate information. To achieve a significant effect on combating cervical cancer, eliminating HPV knowledge gaps is essential. One strategy is to first educate mothers. Thus, this study seeks to develop a health communication randomized controlled HPV educational intervention in DC that targets African-American mothers who have unvaccinated daughters between the ages of 9 and 17. Participants will be randomized into one of two arms, a group intervention arm or a wait-listed control group arm. The specific aims and hypotheses to be tested are: Aim 1: To conduct a randomized controlled trial health communication intervention to increase knowledge awareness about HPV and the HPV vaccine among low socioeconomic status African-American mothers. H1: African-American mothers receiving the group educational intervention will have greater HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge awareness compared to the wait-listed control group; and Aim 2: To assess the factors associated with mothers acceptability or non-acceptability of the HPV vaccine for their daughters. H2: Mothers receiving the group educational intervention will have greater HPV vaccine acceptability for their daughters than the wait-listed control group.

"Southeast Asian Women's Health Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Southeast Asian Women's Health Project Cervical cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among women in the United States, with more than 12,000 new cases and 4,000 deaths each year. Southeast Asians (SEAs) experience the highest cervical cancer incidence of any racial/ethnic group, yet they are screened at remarkably low rates. The most common cervical cancer screening is a Papanicolaou (Pap) test. Familial aspects (e.g., relationship between mothers and daughters), intergenerational conflict (e.g., bicultural straddling), and communication patterns (e.g., what is communicated, manner of communication) about cancer and cancer prevention are factors that potentially play a role in cervical cancer beliefs and Pap test uptake. The purpose of this proposed study is to determine the factors that influence Pap test uptake among SEAs, specifically Cambodian and Lao, mother-daughter dyads. The specific aims are to (1) describe the perceptions of cervical cancer, Pap tests, and cervical cancer screening behaviors among Cambodian and Lao women aged 18-65 and (2) examine, in terms of cervical cancer beliefs and Pap test uptake, the communication patterns among Cambodian and Lao mother-daughter dyads, aged 18-65, within the context of social and cultural factors (i.e., biculturalism, familialism), and how mothes and daughters influence one another. In this exploratory study, we will interview a purposeful sample of Cambodian and Lao women aged 18 to 65 living in Franklin County, Ohio. To examine communication patterns related to cervical cancer knowledge, beliefs, and Pap test uptake, we will conduct focus groups with each of the two ethnic groups (Cambodian and Lao): three focus groups with daughters only and three focus groups with mothers only. Those will inform in-depth interviews to be conducted in an additionally recruited set of mother-daughter dyads. Afterward, we will conduct four additional focus groups with separately recruited mother-daughter dyads from each ethnic group to clarify and validate         themes that emerged from previous focus groups and in-depth interviews. This study is innovative with its unique focus on Cambodian and Lao mother-daughter relationships, a key source of social support and influence on health behaviors that may potentially have lasting impact on women across generations. In this study, we will not only define culturally based factors that influence Pap test completion, but also describe them in the context of SEA culture and intergenerational cultural dialogue, allowing future interventions to leverage these beliefs to optimize intervention effect. This study will inform our long-term plan to develop a culturally appropriate, targeted cervical cancer educational intervention for SEA women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cambodian and Lao women experience some of the highest cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in the United States, yet little research exists on ways to address and reduce this cancer health disparity in these two populations. The proposed exploratory study seeks to expand our understanding of Cambodian and Lao women's perceptions of cervical cancer and screening and examine the communication patterns between Cambodian and Lao mothers and daughters related to cervical cancer beliefs and Pap test uptake.

"Adapting patient navigation to promote cancer screening in Chicagos Chinatown DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the presence of five major academic medical centers, a large county hospital, and two NCI designated comprehensive cancer centers, Chicago has some of the worst cancer disparities between income groups in the US. This burden is accentuated with respect to linguistically and culturally isolated immigrants who do not traditionally benefit from nor participate in research. In particular, Chinese women in Chicago, a significantly understudied population, have unacceptably low breast and cervical cancer screening rates which are only half the rates of white women.  This application is a direct outgrowth of concerns expressed by leaders of Chicago's Chinatown community about the need to educate and empower low income Chinese women about cancer prevention and control. Patient navigators (PN) have been studied in African American, Latino, and white populations. However, PN research has largely focused on follow-up of patients with cancer or abnormal findings, rarely to improve screening rates. We seek to study the dissemination of PN behavioral health services interventions by implementing a tailored PN intervention with a focus on increasing breast and cervical cancer screening as well as follow-up for the largely immigrant population of low income women in Chinatown. Our proposed research builds on two NIH funded PN studies, our Chinatown RC4 research infrastructure grant activities, including a community data resource center, and our long-standing community based participatory research (CBPR) partnership with Chinatown's major safety net provider, Mercy Medical Center.  Using mixed methods within a CBPR approach, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of PN adaptation and extension to cancer control education and screening under the auspices of our community research partner, the Chinese American Service League. We will study the fundamental mechanisms required to optimally adapt interventions focused on immigrant populations that are culturally and linguistically isolated. The proposed project seeks to expand the role of PNs, to learn more about what determines the effectiveness of PNs as health educators, how to encourage breast and cervical cancer screening, and how PNs can become trusted and respected community health workers and advocates that provide essential links between the community and the health care system for low income women in Chicago's Chinatown.  This research will assess how Chinese women interact with health information and resources via a PN team to make health decisions and access the health care system. Women comprise the largest segment of health workers, health consumers, and health decision makers for their families and communities, but are underrepresented accessing appropriate health services among Asian immigrant populations. Once women are empowered, informed health consumers, they become catalysts for social change. This proposed project aims to adapt the rapidly growing phenomenon of patient navigation into a broader effort to use community health workers for culturally competent cancer control and prevention. Our CBPR approach, grounded in the long-standing prestige of our community organization and safety net provider partners, offers the opportunity to close the loop between community-defined health problems and access to the local health care system. Because many women in Illinois already have public insurance coverage for cancer screening and follow-up but do not take advantage of this resource, this proposal has major relevance for future efforts to increase access for vulnerable populations once broader health reform laws are implemented.",Adapting patient navigation to promote cancer screening in Chicagos Chinatown,8817255,R01CA163830,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Behavior ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Chicago ', ' Chinese American ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Grasses ', ' Gramineae ', ' Poaceae ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' County Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Illinois ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Institutes ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Change ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Uninsured ', ' Social Network ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Diffuse ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Sustainable Development ', ' Immigrant ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' Test Result ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' Medical center ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' behavioral health ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Health Educators ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Population Research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' safety net ', ' community safety ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' community organizations ', ' Network-based ', ' community based participatory research ', ' service intervention ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' healthy aging ', ' intervention effect ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,524244,0.06443251706857955
"HPV and Cancer mHealth Prevention Education for HIV Positive Women Pilot Study     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is a research assistant professor with academic training in health promotion, education, and behavior, as well as postdoctoral training in HIV/AIDS prevention, health disparities, and health services research. She also has data management expertise and clinical immunology experience. The candidate has completed two pilot studies that examined HPV infection and cervical cancer prevention knowledge, beliefs and screening behaviors among women living with HIV (WLH). The candidate is seeking additional training needed to develop and implement effective cancer health (including mHealth) communication and community navigation strategies to improve WLH's timely use of cancer screening, diagnostic and treatment services and procedures. The candidate's long-term goal is to obtain extramural research funding for her independent research program focusing on the prevention and control of HPV-mediated cancers among WLH over the next 5-10 years. Promotion to associate professor (tenure- or research-track) is an intermediate goal that the candidate is striving to attain within the next five years. A combination of formal didactic trainig and experiential learning opportunities will be used to acquire cancer prevention and control research skills in the following areas: cancer health (including mHealth) communication, cancer epidemiology, HPV-mediated cancer biology, community navigation, advanced epidemiological research skills (e.g., social epidemiology, n- of-1 research study designs, and, multilevel modeling). The candidate will use the cancer prevention and control research and health communication knowledge and skills acquired through the proposed career development award to conduct formative research needed to inform intervention development in which she will examine cancer health information seeking and sharing among WLH as well as their non-clinical HIV service providers (e.g., HIV/STI risk reduction counselors). Non-clinical HIV service providers will be included because, in addition to the fact that these individuals are already promoting safe sexual practices among WLH, they are also able to reach marginalized groups of WLH such as those who are homeless. This includes sheltered and unsheltered homeless WLH. The candidate's mentors and co-mentors have scientific expertise and community-based participatory research experience that will increase the likelihood of the proposed specific aims being successfully completed. The candidate will first examine HPV-mediated cancer prevention knowledge, beliefs and behaviors, as well as cancer health communication seeking and sharing behaviors (including the use of technology to find health information) (Aim 1). These formative research data will then be used to inform the development (Aim 2) and subsequent pilot testing and evaluation (Aim 3) of an HPV- mediated cancer prevention mHealth education intervention aimed at training WLH who already serve as peer leaders and non-clinical HIV service providers to use mHealth tools and community navigation strategies to disseminate HPV-mediated cancer prevention education. As community navigators, these individuals will use cancer health (including mHealth) communication and community navigation strategies to increase awareness about HPV-mediated cancer risk. This will include promoting cancer risk reducing behaviors such as safe sexual practices and the timely use of recommended cancer screening, diagnostic, and treatment services and procedures). Recall and reminder messages will be sent for screening and follow-up cancer care appointments. User-defined social support messages will also be sent to WLH who may be encountering access to cancer care barriers. The candidate will disseminate the scientific research findings to local, regional, national, and international audiences via presentations that she will give at scientific conferences and annual meetings as well as peer-reviewed publications that she will produce. Most relevant to the candidate's long-term goal of attaining research independence is increasing her number of peer-reviewed publications from her current publication rate of approximately three per year to four or more produced annually by the end of the 5-year training period and the submission of at least one grant proposal (e.g., R01-level funding) by the end of the 5-year training period. The proposed career development/training and research activities will enable the candidate to realize her long-term career goal of becoming an independent cancer researcher with expertise in using cancer health communication, community navigation, and mHealth technologies to address health system failures encountered by vulnerable, medically-underserved WLH along the cancer care continuum. Continued mentoring and opportunities for team science research collaborations will facilitate the candidate's successful progression to being an independent cancer researcher. WLH and non-clinical HIV service providers will be recruited from Ryan White funded clinics and AIDS-service organizations located in urban and rural geographical areas of South Carolina that represent a microcosm of disparities in HIV/AIDS, cancer, and other chronic illness that disproportionately burden medically underserved minority populations. Addressing health system failures that occur along the cancer care continuum that result in missed opportunities to prevent, detect, diagnose and treat HPV-mediated cancers will help to reduce the burden of cancer incidence and mortality among this high cancer risk, vulnerable group of WLH. The proposed HPV-mediated cancer mHealth prevention education intervention will be conducted in a community-based setting and builds upon an existing academic-community partnership between the candidate and a local AIDS-service organization. The candidate has a supportive, resource-intensive scientific environment for her cancer research training.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-positive women, who are predominantly African-American (AA) with an already disproportionate burden of cervical cancer, have a greater risk for developing cervical cancer as well as other HPV-mediated anogenital and head-and-neck cancers because of their weakened immune systems that decrease their body's ability to clear potentially oncogenic HPV infection. Innovative community-driven mHealth solutions focused on addressing cancer prevention knowledge deficits and promoting adherence to recommended cancer screening, detection and treatment services and procedures will be developed and evaluated. Mobile technologies are a promising, cost-effective approach to reducing these cancer health disparities among women living with HIV/AIDS by improving HPV-mediated cancer health outcomes and timely use of cancer care services for this high cancer risk, vulnerable group of largely medically underserved women.

"PRISM: Personalized Reminders for Immunization using Short Messaging systems DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Problem: Vaccination coverage is well below Healthy People 2010 and 2020 goals, with substantial disparities for low-income and other disadvantaged populations. Health information technology interventions that link communication technologies, like text messaging, with electronic health record data offer low-cost, scalable opportunities to foster vaccination as well as other preventive care behaviors. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of such interventions on vaccination coverage at levels in line with other forms of reminder/recall particularly in low-income populations for whom other forms of reminder-recall have not been successful. However, their effect has not been as robust as needed. More effective messaging interventions are needed.  Adolescents, in particular minority adolescents, are not adequately protected against human papillomavirus (HPV) and its potential sequelae, which include cancer and genital warts. Despite the highly efficacious vaccine being recommended for all adolescents, completion rates among those who initiate the 3- dose series are low, particularly among minorities. Using a non-randomized design, we demonstrated the effect of conventional text message vaccine reminders, notifying a parent their child was due for the next dose, in increasing HPV vaccination in primarily, urban Latina adolescents. Although much improved over controls, only 50% received their next dose on time and only 45% completed the series. While these results strongly support the potential effectiveness of this intervention in minority populations for whom traditional forms of vaccination reminders have not worked, still fewer than half completed the vaccine series.  A potential advantage of text message HIT interventions that has not been well investigated is the ability to provide personalized messages. We propose to compare the use of personalized HPV vaccine text message reminders to conventional text message reminders among minority adolescents in a pragmatic randomized trial. The trans-theoretical model of behavior change will guide the tailoring of our text messages. Specific Aim: To compare the effectiveness in improving HPV vaccine series completion for minority adolescents of personalized text message reminders with tailored vaccine-health-literacy-promoting information vs. conventional text message vaccination reminders. Methods: 956 parents of adolescent girls and boys who have received the 1st HPV vaccine dose will be randomized to receive either: 1) personalized or (2) conventional text messages. Personalized reminders include vaccine health literacy-promoting information tailored to parental stage of decision-making. Conventional text message reminders solely notify a parent their child is due for the next dose such as used in previous HPV vaccine text message studies. Outcomes: The primary outcome is completion of 3-dose HPV vaccine series within 12 months. If successful this project could support a new paradigm in interactive health communication in a low cost, scalable manner that may be readily disseminated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed translational research seeks to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the impact on HPV vaccine series completion of personalized HPV vaccination text message reminders to conventional text message reminders among minority adolescents. If successful this project could support a new paradigm in interactive health communication in a low cost, scalable, and sustainable manner that may be readily disseminated.",PRISM: Personalized Reminders for Immunization using Short Messaging systems,8882225,R01HS022677,[''],AHRQ,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,248510,0.07764163883313635
"Development of a Cervical Cancer Screening Program for Refugee Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1975, more than 3 million refugees have been resettled in the United States. Currently, about one-half of all newly admitted refugees are from Bhutan or Burma. Regular cervical cancer screening is recommended for all women ages 21-65. Refugee groups have very high cervical cancer incidence rates and very low cervical cancer screening rates. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines specify that refugee women should be offered cervical cancer screening early in their resettlement period. Multiple organizations provide services to newly and recently arrived refugees; these organizations include voluntary resettlement agencies, mutual assistance associations, ethnic community organizations, local health departments, and health care facilities that serve vulnerable groups. Our long-term goal is to evaluate a contextually relevant cervical cancer control program targeting refugee women during their resettlement. The program would involve use of culturally tailored videos, as well as logistic assistance accessing screening services (i.e. navigation). Refugee resettlement organization personnel would implement the intervention components. This developmental application has the following objectives: (1) Through focus group research, identify and describe cervical cancer screening barriers and facilitators among refugee women; (2) Develop culturally tailored educational and motivational cervical cancer screening videos (that could be used in multiple resettlement settings); (3) Pilot test the intervention program (video use and logistic assistance), and conduct an exploratory evaluation of the program; and (4) Through key informant interviews with representatives from refugee resettlement organizations, assess refugee organizations readiness to implement our intervention program during the resettlement process. The investigator group has extensive experience working with refugee communities and resettlement organizations, as well as conducting cervical cancer control research in vulnerable populations. Our research will be conducted in Washington State. This developmental research will focus on refugee women from Bhutan and Burma (who are particularly unfamiliar with western health systems, as well as concepts of cancer and preventive care). However, our intervention program could be adapted for use with other refugee groups in the future. We will collaborate with a community advisory group (that includes representatives from refugee resettlement organizations) throughout the project. The Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations will guide all aspects of our research with refugee women. Weiner's Theory of Organizational Readiness will guide our key informant interviews with representatives from refugee resettlement organizations. Our exploratory evaluation will include assessments of the videos' potential effect on intermediate outcomes (e.g. knowledge and screening intentions), the videos' acceptability (i.e. women's satisfaction with the videos), and demand for logistic assistance (i.e. women's uptake of logistic assistance).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This exploratory project focuses on developing a cervical cancer screening intervention program for recently arrived refugee women from Bhutan and Burma. Focus groups will be conducted with refugee women (to identify cervical cancer screening barriers and facilitators that should be addressed by the program), and key informant interviews will be conducted with representatives from refugee resettlement organizations (to assess the program's acceptability and feasibility). The intervention program will include use of culturally tailored videos as well as logistic assistance accessing screening services, and will be pilot tested as part of our exploratory research.            ",Development of a Cervical Cancer Screening Program for Refugee Women,8884010,R21CA187401,"['Attention ', ' Bhutan ', ' Burma ', ' Myanmar ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Developing Countries ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Program Acceptability ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Recommendation ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Evaluation ', ' Logistics ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention Guidelines ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 year old ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' social science research ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R21,2015,201635,0.21773381348571527
"Increasing HPV Vaccine Coverage among Young Adult Gay and Bisexual Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gay and bisexual men have high rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-related disease (e.g., anal cancer) compared to the general population. HPV vaccination is a promising strategy for reducing these existing disparities, as routine HPV vaccination is recommended for young gay and bisexual men (YGBM) through age 26. However, little research has addressed HPV vaccination among YGBM, and no interventions we are aware of have been developed specifically for this high-risk population. To address this important research gap, we conducted a national survey of YGBM ages 18-26 in late 2013. Only about 13% of participants had received any doses of HPV vaccine, and results provided valuable information for designing an HPV vaccine intervention for YGBM. Based on results of this preliminary research, an interdisciplinary research team will conduct the proposed study, ""Increasing HPV Vaccine Coverage among Young Adult Gay and Bisexual Men."" The study will develop and pilot test a theoretically-based mobile health (mHealth) HPV vaccine intervention for YGBM that will consist of: 1) population-targeted, individually-tailored content about HPV and HPV vaccine; and 2) vaccination reminders. During pilot testing, the intervention will be compared to a control group that receives standard information about HPV and HPV vaccine via a mobile-friendly website. The study will have two primary aims and an exploratory aim. Aim 1 will develop and pilot test the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention for YGBM to establish intervention feasibility and acceptability. Feasibility will be established by meeting recruitment (n=94) and retention (85% retention over a 6-month follow-up period) goals for the pilot study, and acceptability will be established by comparing participant satisfaction with study materials between the intervention and control groups. Aim 2 will obtain preliminary efficacy data on whether the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention increases HPV vaccine initiation compared to the control group. HPV vaccine initiation (i.e., receipt of the first dose of the three-dose HPV vaccine series) will serve as the primary outcome for the pilot study. An exploratory aim will examine whether the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention affects secondary outcomes compared to the control group. Secondary outcomes will include receipt of the second and third doses of the HPV vaccine series and changes in potential mediators between study group and HPV vaccination. Results from the pilot study will establish intervention feasibility and acceptability and provide valuable preliminary data on outcomes related to HPV vaccination. These data will inform an R01 grant application to test the efficacy of the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention in a large randomized controlled trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will develop and pilot test a mobile health (mHealth) HPV vaccine intervention for young gay and bisexual men.

"Sexual Health Empowerment for Cervical Health Literacy and Cancer Prevention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women in the criminal justice system are four-five times as likely to have cervical cancer compared to non- incarcerated women. In our previous research, we found that the most important contributor to cervical cancer risk, and perhaps lack of follow-up, is incarcerated women's low health literacy about broader reproductive health issues. Until we effectively address incarcerated women's unique reproductive health literacy needs, the cervical cancer health disparity between incarcerated and non-incarcerated women will persist. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a sexual health empowerment (SHE Project) intervention to improve cervical health knowledge, reduce barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, improve self-efficacy for navigatin providers and health care systems, and ultimately work towards preventing cervical cancer. This objective is responsive to PAR-10-133 in that it develops an intervention strategy to address health literacy and broader health outcomes in a vulnerable population. To meet the objectives of this study, we propose to assess the impact of a sexual health empowerment intervention (SHE Project) on cervical health knowledge; barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, and self-efficacy for screening and follow-up among women leaving jail. More specifically, we will conduct a pre- and post-intervention assessment from baseline to the end of a weeklong intervention using a wait-list control design. Next, we will use a three-year observational study design employing both survey and ethnographic methods for follow-up, to understand how knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, and other factors change post-release cervical health prevention behaviors over time. This approach will allow us to observe the extent to which women translate, if at all, increased knowledge, reduced barriers, and increased self-efficacy into practice during clinical encounters, or if other factors explain health behaviors ove time. The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for this high risk and vulnerable group of women. Our development of an effective and easily disseminated health literacy intervention that can be adapted to many health conditions and broader cancer prevention efforts in institutionalized populations (jails, prisons, community corrections, military institutions) will have an impact on public health, and also on the science of developing effective health literacy interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for the high risk and vulnerable group of women in the criminal justice system. An empowerment approach to health literacy interventions will also have an impact on broader reproductive health problems in this high risk population.

"Etiology of cervical cancer health disparity in American Indian women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in women worldwide. American Indian (AI) women living on the Northern Plains have a greater incidence of cervical cancer and suffer from a higher mortality rate. Our recent studies have shown that AI women have more than twice the incidence of HPV infection and that HPV positive AI women have a two times higher likelihood of having abnormal PAP tests than HPV positive Caucasian women; suggesting underlying causes which increase HPV pathology. One potential cofactor may be smoke exposure and its effects on the host immune response and HPV oncogenesis. Our data indicate that 4 times more AI women smoke as compared to Caucasian women and the majority of HPV positive AI women smoke. While smoking is a recognized risk factor for cervical cancer, the molecular interactions between HPV and smoke compounds are unknown. Our laboratory has recently shown that smoke carcinogen Benzo[a]Pyrene (BaP) increases the expression of HPV oncoproteins, suggesting a direct molecular link between HPV infection and exposure to smoke. We have also identified that curcumin, a natural anti-cancer compound, effectively inhibits the expression of HPV oncoproteins. Based on this compelling evidence, we hypothesize that exposure to tobacco smoke synergizes with HPV infection and increases the incidence and severity of cervical cancer in American Indian women by increasing the expression of HPV oncoproteins (E6/E7) and modulating cellular/humoral immune responses. Additionally, we hypothesize that curcumin or nanocurcumin may be effective methods for the repression of HPV infection in AI women. We propose to 1) investigate novel mechanisms of synergy between HPV infection, BaP and the development of cervical cancer, 2) evaluate the efficacy of curcumin/nanocurcumin to suppress HPV oncogene expression in preclinical and clinical settings, and 3) to investigate the effect of smoke exposure on cervical immune responses. The results of this study will provide information regarding underlying etiological factors that are responsible for cervical cancer health disparity in AI women and will ultimately reduce the burden of cervical cancer.

"Reducing Cervical Cancer in Appalachia In response to RFA ES-02-009, a multi-disciplinary group of investigators from the Ohio State University and the University of Michigan have collaborated to propose a Center for Population Health and Health Disparities focusing on an important health issue in underserved populations,cancer. The Center will initially focus on the goal of understanding why high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are observed in Appalachia Ohio, a mainly rural area in Southern and Eastern Ohio. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research within the framework of the Social Determinants of Health model in three inter-related projects and four supporting cores. All studies will be conducted in 16 clinics which represent the general population of women aged 18 and older in the region. We will utilize the Center's internal and external advisory committees and community partners organized into a community advisory board and Consortium of communityorganizations to facilitate the accomplishment of project goals. Project 1 will recruit 1600 women to an observational study to  investigate multi-level (social, environmental, behavioral, and biological) correlates of ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization, in Phase I. From this cohort of women, those who smoke (30%) will be eligible to participate in Project 2, which tests the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote smoking cessation (behavioral) and validate cessation endpoints with saliva cotinine measurements (biological) in a quasi-experimental trial design; those women who are in need of & Pap test (48% of 1600) will be eligible to participate in Phase II of Project 1 which will test the effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote ""risk-appropriate"" Pap smear utilization (behavioral) and follow-up for abnormalities (biological) detected in a quasi-experimental trial design. Project 3 will examine the contribution of HPV (biological) to cervical abnormalities in Appalachia in relation to individual-level behaviors (e.g. smoking, sexual activity) within the social and environmental region of Appalachia in a case-control observational study among women who have Pap smears in these 16 clinics.The research will be supported by four cores: A) Administration - fiscal and Center oversight; B) Biostatistics and Data Resources - sample selection, data management, data analysis, and population data resources; C) Clinical Correlative Sciences - collect, obtain and process biomarker specimens; and D) Behavioral Assessment and Intervention - train interviewers and lay health educators, conduct interviews, design intervention material, and facilitate  communication amongst sites. The Center includes a mechanism for pilot project solicitation, review and funding. This Center has institutional commitment in terms of personnel, funds and space, as well as, a commitment to focus on the problem of health disparities in the region. Finally, members of the team have worked together in the past in various settings that focus on the goals of the proposed Center and have an established relationship in Appalachian Ohio for the purpose of improving the health of the population. Future work of this Center will focus on moving this type of multi-level observational and interventional community-based research, into other areas where health disparities exist in relation to cancer withinour region. Cervical cancer disparities exist among women in Appalachia. Our previous work has found that the prevalence of factors known to cause cervical cancer e.g. tobacco use, genetic predisposition, HPV infection, and stress due to economic conditions, are disproportionately higher in this population.

"HPV and Cancer mHealth Prevention Education for HIV Positive Women Pilot Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is a research assistant professor with academic training in health promotion, education, and behavior, as well as postdoctoral training in HIV/AIDS prevention, health disparities, and health services research. She also has data management expertise and clinical immunology experience. The candidate has completed two pilot studies that examined HPV infection and cervical cancer prevention knowledge, beliefs and screening behaviors among women living with HIV (WLH). The candidate is seeking additional training needed to develop and implement effective cancer health (including mHealth) communication and community navigation strategies to improve WLH's timely use of cancer screening, diagnostic and treatment services and procedures. The candidate's long-term goal is to obtain extramural research funding for her independent research program focusing on the prevention and control of HPV-mediated cancers among WLH over the next 5-10 years. Promotion to associate professor (tenure- or research-track) is an intermediate goal that the candidate is striving to attain within the next five years. A combination of formal didactic trainig and experiential learning opportunities will be used to acquire cancer prevention and control research skills in the following areas: cancer health (including mHealth) communication, cancer epidemiology, HPV-mediated cancer biology, community navigation, advanced epidemiological research skills (e.g., social epidemiology, n- of-1 research study designs, and, multilevel modeling). The candidate will use the cancer prevention and control research and health communication knowledge and skills acquired through the proposed career development award to conduct formative research needed to inform intervention development in which she will examine cancer health information seeking and sharing among WLH as well as their non-clinical HIV service providers (e.g., HIV/STI risk reduction counselors). Non-clinical HIV service providers will be included because, in addition to the fact that these individuals are already promoting safe sexual practices among WLH, they are also able to reach marginalized groups of WLH such as those who are homeless. This includes sheltered and unsheltered homeless WLH. The candidate's mentors and co-mentors have scientific expertise and community-based participatory research experience that will increase the likelihood of the proposed specific aims being successfully completed. The candidate will first examine HPV-mediated cancer prevention knowledge, beliefs and behaviors, as well as cancer health communication seeking and sharing behaviors (including the use of technology to find health information) (Aim 1). These formative research data will then be used to inform the development (Aim 2) and subsequent pilot testing and evaluation (Aim 3) of an HPV- mediated cancer prevention mHealth education intervention aimed at training WLH who already serve as peer leaders and non-clinical HIV service providers to use mHealth tools and community navigation strategies to disseminate HPV-mediated cancer prevention education. As community navigators, these individuals will use cancer health (including mHealth) communication and community navigation strategies to increase awareness about HPV-mediated cancer risk. This will include promoting cancer risk reducing behaviors such as safe sexual practices and the timely use of recommended cancer screening, diagnostic, and treatment services and procedures). Recall and reminder messages will be sent for screening and follow-up cancer care appointments. User-defined social support messages will also be sent to WLH who may be encountering access to cancer care barriers. The candidate will disseminate the scientific research findings to local, regional, national, and international audiences via presentations that she will give at scientific conferences and annual meetings as well as peer-reviewed publications that she will produce. Most relevant to the candidate's long-term goal of attaining research independence is increasing her number of peer-reviewed publications from her current publication rate of approximately three per year to four or more produced annually by the end of the 5-year training period and the submission of at least one grant proposal (e.g., R01-level funding) by the end of the 5-year training period. The proposed career development/training and research activities will enable the candidate to realize her long-term career goal of becoming an independent cancer researcher with expertise in using cancer health communication, community navigation, and mHealth technologies to address health system failures encountered by vulnerable, medically-underserved WLH along the cancer care continuum. Continued mentoring and opportunities for team science research collaborations will facilitate the candidate's successful progression to being an independent cancer researcher. WLH and non-clinical HIV service providers will be recruited from Ryan White funded clinics and AIDS-service organizations located in urban and rural geographical areas of South Carolina that represent a microcosm of disparities in HIV/AIDS, cancer, and other chronic illness that disproportionately burden medically underserved minority populations. Addressing health system failures that occur along the cancer care continuum that result in missed opportunities to prevent, detect, diagnose and treat HPV-mediated cancers will help to reduce the burden of cancer incidence and mortality among this high cancer risk, vulnerable group of WLH. The proposed HPV-mediated cancer mHealth prevention education intervention will be conducted in a community-based setting and builds upon an existing academic-community partnership between the candidate and a local AIDS-service organization. The candidate has a supportive, resource-intensive scientific environment for her cancer research training. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-positive women, who are predominantly African-American (AA) with an already disproportionate burden of cervical cancer, have a greater risk for developing cervical cancer as well as other HPV-mediated anogenital and head-and-neck cancers because of their weakened immune systems that decrease their body's ability to clear potentially oncogenic HPV infection. Innovative community-driven mHealth solutions focused on addressing cancer prevention knowledge deficits and promoting adherence to recommended cancer screening, detection and treatment services and procedures will be developed and evaluated. Mobile technologies are a promising, cost-effective approach to reducing these cancer health disparities among women living with HIV/AIDS by improving HPV-mediated cancer health outcomes and timely use of cancer care services for this high cancer risk, vulnerable group of largely medically underserved women.",HPV and Cancer mHealth Prevention Education for HIV Positive Women Pilot

"Web App Technology for Boys and Parents: Improving HPV Vaccine Uptake The President's Cancer Advisory Board and the Centers for Disease Control have called for renewed efforts in promoting vaccination for Human Papillomavirus (HPV), including vaccination for adolescent boys, because the uptake of this new vaccine remains alarmingly low. Currently, less than 15% of adolescent boys have received the HPV vaccine; thus, most of this population remains at risk for oropharyngeal, anal, and penile cancers. Many parents remain unconvinced of the safety and effectiveness of HPV vaccines, so effective and accessible messaging to improve decision-making on this vaccine is needed. Parents of adolescent boys also have different concerns about HPV vaccination than for adolescent girls, creating a need for unique health communication interventions to promote vaccine uptake among boys. Interventions also need to address the unique challenges of minority populations and populations for whom English is not the first language. A novel digital intervention will be produced and evaluated for its ability to improve HPV vaccine outcomes. Specifically, a mobile responsive web application (“mobile web app”) will be created that performs similar to a mobile app but runs on a variety of computing platforms from personal desktop and laptop computers to the latest smart phones and tablet computers. Mobile web app content will be targeted to parents and adolescent boys aged 11-13 years living in New Mexico, a majority-minority population with large proportions of Hispanics, Whites, and Native Americans. The specific aims are to: 1) carefully and systematically develop a mobile web app (BoyVac) for smart phones, tablet computers, and personal computers that will utilize Diffusion of Innovations principles to provide targeted information concerning HPV vaccine adoption to adolescent males and their parents, particularly minority adolescents and parents; 2) implement a comprehensive and rigorous test of the impact of the BoyVac mobile web app intervention on HPV vaccine adoption outcomes via a randomized efficacy trial (BoyVac v. usual and customary care); and 3) examine the dose-response relationships between mobile web app usage and vaccine outcomes within a components analysis. A group-randomized pretest-posttest controlled design will be implemented, recruiting 1800 pairs of parents and adolescent boys from 30 pediatric clinics (n=60 parents and boys per clinic) affiliated with the Envision New Mexico, a best practices program at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center's Department of Pediatrics. Parents will be surveyed at baseline, a 3-month follow-up, and a 9-month follow-up and records HPV vaccination adoption for the boys will be obtained from the clinics' medical records at the 9- month follow-up. Analyses will test the hypotheses that 1) more 11-13 year old boys in the intervention group (BoyVac mobile web app) will adopt the HPV vaccine than boys in the usual and customary care comparison group and 2) adoption of HPV vaccine will be mediated by improvements in theoretical mediators among parents in the intervention compared to the usual and customary care comparison group. The uptake of vaccines for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in the U.S. is far below recommended levels, particularly for adolescent boys and especially among minority families. Proposed here is a mobile web application (“mobile web app”) for personal computers, smart phones, and tablet computers that will accurately inform parents and adolescent boys about the HPV vaccination and address unique concerns about its safety and effectiveness for boys. The BoyVac mobile web app will be evaluated for its ability to improve vaccine outcomes in a randomized efficacy trial with parents and adolescent boys aged 11-13 years who obtain care in pediatric clinics in the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center's Envision network.",Web App Technology for Boys and Parents: Improving HPV Vaccine Uptake,9175948,R01CA210125,"['adolescent girl ', '

"Addressing Cervical Cancer Disparity in South Florida CBPR in Action DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities, also known as SUCCESS, supports a number of campus-community partnerships, or Community Advisory Groups (CAGs), throughout the Miami metropolitan area. Such partnerships were conceived in the spirit of Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) and facilitate meaningful collaboration between University investigators and community stakeholders in addressing issues of health disparity. The proposed project focuses on cervical cancer, a topic of significant health concern for three communities served by SUCCESS: Little Haiti, Hialeah, and West Perrine. Like other predominately minority, low-income  neighborhoods across the United States, these communities contribute to excess  cervical cancer incidence and mortality, largely due to lack of access to routine Pap  smear screening and timely follow up for detected abnormalities. SUCCESS aims to address this disparity. For the past three years, we have been engaged in a community trial comparing two innovative modalities for disease prevention: navigation to Pap smear screening at local Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) vs. home-based self-sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV), the principal cause of cervical cancer.  In both arms, Community Health Workers (CHWs) play a critical role in intervention delivery. However, our preliminary data indicate that CHW involvement may matter less than the method of screening itself. Screening uptake is significantly higher among women randomized to self-sampling in all three communities, likely given the ease of use and participant preference for home-based screening, which circumvents structural and cultural barriers to care. The proposed study will formally test the significance of CHW participation by comparing self-sampling provided by a CHW with self-sampling provided by mail. We will implement a two-arm study of 700 women from across our three target communities, with the CHW-self sampling intervention serving as our control group, or arm. Our primary aim is 1) to determine which method of self-sampling results in a greater proportion of women screened. Secondary outcomes include comparisons  of a) knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about cervical cancer and the importance of early  detection of disease~ b) access to care (health insurance, having a usual source of care,  and visit to provider in six months), particularly among women having abnormal screens  and requiring medical intervention~ and the c) relative cost of the two intervention  strategies. Consistent with the tenets of CBPR, the focus and scope of such work was informed by the SUCCESS CAGs in Little Haiti, Hialeah, and West Perrine.  By enlisting community leadership in study conceptualization, we ensure that we can successfully achieve our intended goal, to identify the most optimal strategy for cervical cancer prevention among women who disproportionately contribute to disease incidence and mortality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cervical cancer disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minorities, recent immigrants, and low-income individuals.  The proposed project aims to address this disparity through a Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) initiative that tests two innovative methods for disease prevention. Consistent with the tenets of CBPR, the focus of this effort reflects community input and is grounded in community members' preferences for health and disease prevention.",Addressing Cervical Cancer Disparity in South Florida CBPR in Action,9056552,R01CA183612,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Florida ', ' Goals ', ' Haiti ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Home Visits ', ' House Call ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Leadership ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Printing ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' metropolitan ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Community Trial ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' home visit ', ' Home visitation ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' trial comparing ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' secondary outcome ', ' arm ', ' two-arm study ', ' screening ', ' community partnership ', ' Caribbean Hispanic ', ' Haitian ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2016,508478,0.1889261132974117
"Cervical, Anal & Oral HPV Persistence/Adolescent Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Adolescents and young women have the highest rates of cervical HPV, including infection with the HPV types causing significant morbidity and mortality. Introduction of the FDA-approved quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil(R), Merck & Co.) targeting HPV16 and HPV18 (high-risk [HR] types present in >65% of cervical cancers), as well as HPV6 and 11 (associated with most genital warts), has the potential to reduce the burden of genital HPV and disease. HPV vaccine clinical trials focused exclusively on low-risk women with limited numbers of sexual partners who were highly compliant with the vaccine schedule; these females were not representative of those most at risk to suffer from HPV-related disease. In fact, Hispanic and African-American women have the highest and second highest incidence rates of cervical cancer in the U.S., respectively, and high mortality rates from cervical cancer. In addition, the associations of HPV-related anal and/or oropharyngeal lesions are an important public health concern, yet few vaccine studies in women have evaluated HPV at these sites. Subsequent to the approval and release of GARDASIL, we initiated a prospective cohort study of sexually- active, inner-city, minority adolescent women attending the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center (MSAHC), the largest comprehensive adolescent primary care facility in the U.S. To date, this project has enrolled more than 750 sexually active teens between the ages of 12-19. Prevalent HPV infection at enrollment was detected in 54% of cervical, 42% of anal and 20% of oral specimens, with vaccine types (HPV 6/11, 16 & 18) present in 7%, 6% and 1% of adolescents, respectively. Adolescents who had three doses were at significantly reduced risk of HPV vaccine types in the cervix compared to those who had no vaccination. With respect to extracervical sites, non-significant reductions were observed for HR-HPV vaccine types in the anal and oral cavities when comparing fully vaccinated to non-vaccinated adolescents. There was considerable incident (4.2 per 100 person years) detection of cervical HPV 16/18 infection not present at enrollment despite vaccination; this observed rate is substantially above that reported in the efficacy trials. We propose to address the health disparities of HPV in minority young women by continuing our cohort study of high-risk adolescent females participating in an HPV immunization program at MSAHC. We propose to extend the prospective follow-up (with repeat visits every 6 months) to evaluate the long-term burden of infection and to increase sample size to just over 1,400 subjects to improve statistical power. The increased sample size and longer follow-up will allow us to determine risk factors for break-through HPV infections, as well as integrate a new aim to evaluate psychosocial elements of adolescent development and high-risk behaviors in teens. Data obtained from this study will be essential to understanding the 'real-world' impact of HPV vaccination in this group not studied in the vaccine trials and will provide the biological underpinnings for future HPV and cervical cancer screening practices, as well as estimating the potential impact of vaccine on anal and/or oropharyngeal HPV infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescents and young women have the highest rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, including infection with the HPV types causing high-grade neoplasia, cervical and anal cancer. This study investigates the continued burden of HPV in a population of high-risk, predominantly Hispanic and African-American inner- city adolescent women not previously included in the large randomized clinical trials of the HPV vaccine. This study will provide information that is critical to the proper design of screening and preventive strategies in populations that are at the highest risk for HPV-associated diseases despite vaccination.","Cervical, Anal & Oral HPV Persistence/Adolescent Girls",8970666,R01AI072204,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Age ', ' Antibodies ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Venereal Warts ', ' Genital Warts ', ' Condylomata Acuminata ', ' Condyloma Accuminata ', ' Anogenital venereal warts ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Elements ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Infection ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Marketability of a technology-based intervention to increase HPV vaccination. The purpose of this Phase II research project is to evaluate and market an innovative health message intervention to increase uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and reduce women’s cervical cancer risk through partnership with Planned Parenthood. The overall aim is to reach a broad population through Planned Parenthood, the nation’s leading sexual and reproductive health care center, especially among low socioeconomic status (SES) and historically underserved populations. Despite an overall increase in vaccination and reduction in HPV-related infections in younger populations targeted by previous health promotion efforts, young adult women who are recommended for vaccination demonstrate much lower vaccination rates and higher rates of infection. In a recent Phase I grant, we developed and demonstrated the usability and feasibility of an innovative, culturally-grounded, technology-based narrative intervention that delivers decision narratives in the form of videos via a health kiosk, an underutilized communication strategy for reaching less involved audiences. This brief, low-cost, easily implementable intervention doubled the uptake of the vaccine in a separate pilot study. The proposed Phase II project will: (1) Complete development of the intervention, (2) Evaluate its effectiveness through a randomized clinical trial, and (3) Prepare the product for the market. To accomplish these aims, we will develop the intervention for implementation in waiting rooms as part of check-in procedures and exam rooms as part of intake. Our pilot research suggests these are both viable implementation strategies. Development includes programing and installing tablets to accomplish these tasks (Aim 1). We will then conduct the evaluation study in six Planned Parenthood clinics in southeastern Pennsylvania (Aim 2). In the waiting room condition, women will complete check-in via a tablet and that information used to identify and recruit eligible volunteers (unvaccinated women aged 18-26). In the exam room condition the intervention will be viewed on a tablet as part of the intake procedure, facilitated by a nurse or other designated clinic staff. Eligible women will be consented, complete a pretest, and then randomized to view the brief intervention or attention control messages via the tablet. After viewing the messages, they will complete a short posttest. Participants will receive follow up texts/emails reminding them to vaccinate, as well as texts/emails with links that allow them to complete posttest surveys at 3- and 9 months. Finally, we will prepare the intervention for the market that includes not only Planned Parenthood but other clinics that are currently served by the project partners as well as the broader market for HPV vaccination (Aim 3). In summary, the proposed communication strategy has wide reaching implications not only for reducing cancer risk, but more broadly for designing brief and easily implemented prevention messages across many domains of public health. The research will also close the health disparities gap in minority, underserved young adult women’s access to preventive health care. The overall goal of this SBIR Phase II project is to reduce cancer rates by marketing a brief, easily implemented technology-based intervention that increases human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among Planned Parenthood and other clients. The intervention’s innovative technology allows for our narrative videos to be presented along will reminder texts. It will be evaluated in waiting and exam rooms and promises to overcome vaccination barriers among high risk but underserved low SES and minority populations.",Marketability of a technology-based intervention to increase HPV vaccination.,9252965,R44DP006291,[''],NCCDPHP,"REAL PREVENTION, LLC",R44,2016,467333,0.09927628916455686
"Development of a Cervical Cancer Screening Program for Refugee Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1975, more than 3 million refugees have been resettled in the United States. Currently, about one-half of all newly admitted refugees are from Bhutan or Burma. Regular cervical cancer screening is recommended for all women ages 21-65. Refugee groups have very high cervical cancer incidence rates and very low cervical cancer screening rates. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines specify that refugee women should be offered cervical cancer screening early in their resettlement period. Multiple organizations provide services to newly and recently arrived refugees; these organizations include voluntary resettlement agencies, mutual assistance associations, ethnic community organizations, local health departments, and health care facilities that serve vulnerable groups. Our long-term goal is to evaluate a contextually relevant cervical cancer control program targeting refugee women during their resettlement. The program would involve use of culturally tailored videos, as well as logistic assistance accessing screening services (i.e. navigation). Refugee resettlement organization personnel would implement the intervention components. This developmental application has the following objectives: (1) Through focus group research, identify and describe cervical cancer screening barriers and facilitators among refugee women; (2) Develop culturally tailored educational and motivational cervical cancer screening videos (that could be used in multiple resettlement settings); (3) Pilot test the intervention program (video use and logistic assistance), and conduct an exploratory evaluation of the program; and (4) Through key informant interviews with representatives from refugee resettlement organizations, assess refugee organizations readiness to implement our intervention program during the resettlement process. The investigator group has extensive experience working with refugee communities and resettlement organizations, as well as conducting cervical cancer control research in vulnerable populations. Our research will be conducted in Washington State. This developmental research will focus on refugee women from Bhutan and Burma (who are particularly unfamiliar with western health systems, as well as concepts of cancer and preventive care). However, our intervention program could be adapted for use with other refugee groups in the future. We will collaborate with a community advisory group (that includes representatives from refugee resettlement organizations) throughout the project. The Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations will guide all aspects of our research with refugee women. Weiner's Theory of Organizational Readiness will guide our key informant interviews with representatives from refugee resettlement organizations. Our exploratory evaluation will include assessments of the videos' potential effect on intermediate outcomes (e.g. knowledge and screening intentions), the videos' acceptability (i.e. women's satisfaction with the videos), and demand for logistic assistance (i.e. women's uptake of logistic assistance). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This exploratory project focuses on developing a cervical cancer screening intervention program for recently arrived refugee women from Bhutan and Burma. Focus groups will be conducted with refugee women (to identify cervical cancer screening barriers and facilitators that should be addressed by the program), and key informant interviews will be conducted with representatives from refugee resettlement organizations (to assess the program's acceptability and feasibility). The intervention program will include use of culturally tailored videos as well as logistic assistance accessing screening services, and will be pilot tested as part of our exploratory research.",Development of a Cervical Cancer Screening Program for Refugee Women,9014528,R21CA187401,"['Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention Guidelines ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' social science research ', ' screening ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' Burmese ', ' Bhutanese ', ' Attention ', ' Bhutan ', ' Burma ', ' Myanmar ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' mortality ', ' Program Acceptability ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Recommendation ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Evaluation ', ' Logistics ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer care ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R21,2016,220740,0.21773381348571527
"Implementing Cancer Prevention Using Patient - Provider Clinical Decision Support ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of U.S. adults and adolescents do not receive key evidence-based preventive care services. Rural populations are especially disadvantaged with multiple healthcare disparities, resulting in lower rates of primary and secondary cancer prevention interventions. The objective of this project is to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a sophisticated Web-based, electronic health record (EHR)-linked clinical decision support (CDS) system designed to improve primary and secondary cancer preventive care. To achieve this objective, we link EHR data to evidence-based cancer prevention algorithms in a secure Web site to: (a) identify at the point of care all eligible patients not up o date on their cancer prevention interventions; and (b) present to both patient and primary care provider (PCP) and/or a key member of the primary care team, certified medical assistant (CMA), appropriate evidence-based primary cancer prevention interventions and cancer screening options at the point of care. The Cancer Prevention-CDS will focus on breast cancer screening in women aged 50-74, colorectal cancer screening for both sexes aged 50-75, cervical cancer screening for women aged 21-65, human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination for both sexes aged 11-26, and referrals for weight management and smoking cessation in all adults aged 18 and older. Effectiveness is assessed by cluster-randomizing 30 primary care clinics with roughly 285 PCPs and 153,000 study-eligible patients into one of three experimental conditions: Group 1: PCP-focused CDS intervention in which the PCP triggers use of the CDS system and engages patients in appropriate cancer prevention strategies. Group 2: CMA-focused CDS intervention in which the CMA triggers use of the CDS system and interacts with the patient to engage them in appropriate cancer prevention strategies before seeing their PCP, who will approve or discuss the plan with their patient. Group 3 clinics provide usual care with no intervention-related activity related to cancer prevention. With 10 clinics, 95 PCPs, and 51,000 potentially eligible patients per study arm, this study will formally test the hypothesis tht Groups 1 and 2 are superior to Group 3 over an 18-month follow-up period with respect to: (a) significantly higher rates of appropriate screening for breast, cervix, and colorectal cancer, as defined by the United States Preventive Services Task Force; and (b) significantly higher rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in males and females aged 11-26 years. We further posit that Groups 1 and 2 will have higher short-term health care costs but better long-term cost-effectiveness than Group 3. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and RE-AIM conceptual frameworks will be used to guide implementation planning, organization, conduct, and impact evaluation of the intervention in a large rural healthcare system. This project will engage a rural population with substantial healthcare disparities and gaps in the receipt of primary and secondary cancer prevention. Results will advance dissemination and implementation research methods that can reduce health disparities and improve healthcare for millions in medically underserved areas.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If primary and secondary prevention practices for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer were improved, more than 100,000 cancer deaths a year could be delayed or averted in the United States and the burden of these diseases on quality of life reduced. In this project, we will adapt, implement, and evaluate a proven electronic health record-linked, Web-based, personalized clinical decision support system to identify patients needing primary and/or secondary cancer prevention care. The objectives of this project are to improve the quality and consistency of primary and secondary prevention of common cancers in rural areas by providing patient- centered and evidence-based treatment recommendations to both primary care provider teams and patients at the point of care and provide an efficient and effective model for implementation and dissemination of cancer prevention in rural settings.                ",Implementing Cancer Prevention Using Patient -

"A Text Message Intervention to Increase HPV Vaccine Completion in Young Latinas DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Angelica Roncancio, Ph.D. is a motivated postdoctoral fellow, trained as a behavioral scientist, who is currently working at the Center for Health Promotion and Prevention Research at the University of Texas Health Science Center Houston (UTHSC-H) School of Public Health. The overall goal of this NCI K01 career development proposal is to provide Dr. Roncancio with the additional research skills necessary to launch an independent career focused on reducing HPV-related cancer disparities among Latinas. Dr. Roncancio's research examines the psychosocial and cultural determinants of cervical-cancer screening and HPV vaccination among Latinas and seeks to modify health behavior through innovative approaches to screening and vaccination completion. Under the mentorship of Dr. Maria Fernandez she will receive specialized, mentored training in the following areas: 1) cancer disparities in Latino populations, 2) the development of theory-based interventions, and 3) the use of technology in health promotion.          UTHSC-H's rich training environment provides junior investigators with the resources necessary to become independent, productive, and highly successful researchers. For example, it provides outstanding opportunities for developing skills in grant writing, manuscript publication, and project management. UTHSC-H also offers a large variety of courses, workshops, and seminars relevant to public health and behavioral science, along with access to some of the most renowned prevention scientists in cancer research.          Dr. Roncancio's long-term career goal as an independent health researcher is to improve both cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination rates, ultimately aiding in the reduction of cervical cancer disparity in Latinas. She will develop a research program focused on the development and implementation of innovative, culturally appropriate, theory-based interventions to increase cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination among underserved Latinas.          In addition, Dr. Roncancio outlines four short term goals to be achieved throughout the award period that will serve as the foundation for an independent research career: 1) to increase her science-based knowledge in behavioral theory and its application to the development of cancer interventions for underserved populations, particularly Latinas; 2) to increase her knowledge in the use of technology in interventions targeted at hard-to- reach underserved populations; 3) to increase experience in implementing interventions in hard-to-reach populations; and 4) to participate in professional development activities related to cancer health disparities. These goals will be achieved through a combination of formal coursework and directed readings, experience in implementing several research projects, experience in developing and publishing manuscripts, and intensive mentoring to ensure that Dr. Roncancio achieves each of her specific short term goals and becomes a successful independent cervical cancer disparities researcher.          The aims of the proposed research are to: 1) develop an Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction (IM) that explains Spanish-speaking Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series, and 2) develop and pilot test an innovatively-delivered IM-based intervention (via video text messaging) for Spanish-speaking Latino mothers to encourage HPV vaccine series completion for their adolescent daughters. This research is both important and timely given the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer's 2012 recommendation to increase HPV vaccination efforts to combat the rise in incidence rates of some HPV-associated cancers and the finding that Latino adolescent girls are less likely non-Latino white adolescent girls to complete the HPV vaccine series.          The proposed aims will be accomplished through four successive plans of study: 1) a qualitative study to identify the beliefs that underlie Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series; 2) a longitudinal study to identify the associations between the IM predictor variables, intentions, and behavior; 3) a usability study to evaluate the acceptability and appropriateness of the video texts to be delivered to the mothers' cellular phones that were developed to increase HPV vaccine series completion; and 4) a longitudinal pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a theory-based intervention that uses video text messaging as an innovative channel of delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will address a significant gap in our knowledge of the factors that influence Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series and will result in the development of an innovatively-delivered, theory-based intervention that may increase vaccine completion in this population. This intervention will be the first of its kind and has the potential to increase HPV vaccine completion in an underserved population known for low completion rates and for being disproportionately affected by cervical cancer disparities.",A Text Message Intervention to Increase HPV Vaccine Completion in Young Latinas,9131525,K01CA181437,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Daughter ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Mothers ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Reading ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' behavior prediction ', ' experience ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Annual Reports ', ' Angelica ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Operating System ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 12 year old ', ' twelve year old ', ' age 12 years ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' usability ', ' combat ', ' screening ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K01,2016,130345,0.1961302127620193
"Increasing Uptake of Evidence Based Screening Services though a CHW-led multi-modality program: The South Florida Center for Reducing Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Miami's South Florida Center for Reducing Health Disparities (SUCCESS) aims to improve the health of South Florida's most vulnerable populations through collaborative, participatory research. Our primary focus has been to improve early detection and prevention of diseases that disproportionately affect communities, disenfranchised from the formal healthcare system. Towards this end, we have tested the effectiveness of multiple Community Health Worker (CHW)-led interventions to improve screening uptake for four priority health conditions: HIV, Hepatitis C, Colorectal Cancer (CRC), and cervical cancer. However, a major limitation of all such projects is that each has existed as distinct, standalone initiative targeting a specific community and/or individuals who meet narrow eligibility criteria. The current proposal will address this gap. We propose to develop and implement a clinical trial that offers screening for all four health conditions in a no-clinical setting, circumventing known structural and access barriers to care. Our partners in this application are our longstanding collaborators: the Health Choice Network- a consortium of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and the Center for Haitian Studies. Based on their input, we propose a pragmatic trial of 900 people ages 50-65 who self-identify as Hispanic, Haitian, and/or African and have not been appropriately screened for the aforementioned diseases of interest. Our specific aim is to determine whether a CHW led intervention, which provides innovative, home based screening increases uptake among medically underserved individuals who are in need of at least of these tests. This multi-modality approach will use oral swabs for HIV, finger stick testing for Hepatitis C, Fecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT) for CRC, and self- sampling for Human Papilloma Virus, the primary cause of cervical cancer. The proposed pragmatic trial, grounded in the tenets of community-based participatory research (CBPR), will help identify optimal strategies for delivering prevention services to medically-vulnerable population sub-groups. Our study testing innovative, cost sensitive approaches will help inform health reform strategies that increasingly prioritize population health and precision medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minority groups suffer disproportionately from conditions such as HIV, Hepatitis C, colorectal and cervical cancer. Strategies that can increase rates of screening for these conditions can help narrow such disparities. We propose a study in which community health workers use recent advances in home testing technology to see if having these screenings services done at home leads to more screenings than simply referring persons to more traditional medical care.        ",Increasing Uptake of Evidence Based Screening Services though a CHW-led multi-modality program: The South Florida Center for Reducing Health Disparities,9129354,U01MD010614,"['recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Privacy ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' community planning ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' metropolitan ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' prevention service ', ' Health Information System ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Swab ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Screening Result ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Community Health ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' medically underserved ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' population health ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' Haitian ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Collection ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Feedback ', ' Fingers ', ' Florida ', ' Haiti ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Priorities ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' hep C ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Papilloma Viruses ', ' Papillomavirus ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2016,514693,0.043329158779923806
"Adapting patient navigation to promote cancer screening in Chicagos Chinatown DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the presence of five major academic medical centers, a large county hospital, and two NCI designated comprehensive cancer centers, Chicago has some of the worst cancer disparities between income groups in the US. This burden is accentuated with respect to linguistically and culturally isolated immigrants who do not traditionally benefit from nor participate in research. In particular, Chinese women in Chicago, a significantly understudied population, have unacceptably low breast and cervical cancer screening rates which are only half the rates of white women.  This application is a direct outgrowth of concerns expressed by leaders of Chicago's Chinatown community about the need to educate and empower low income Chinese women about cancer prevention and control. Patient navigators (PN) have been studied in African American, Latino, and white populations. However, PN research has largely focused on follow-up of patients with cancer or abnormal findings, rarely to improve screening rates. We seek to study the dissemination of PN behavioral health services interventions by implementing a tailored PN intervention with a focus on increasing breast and cervical cancer screening as well as follow-up for the largely immigrant population of low income women in Chinatown. Our proposed research builds on two NIH funded PN studies, our Chinatown RC4 research infrastructure grant activities, including a community data resource center, and our long-standing community based participatory research (CBPR) partnership with Chinatown's major safety net provider, Mercy Medical Center.  Using mixed methods within a CBPR approach, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of PN adaptation and extension to cancer control education and screening under the auspices of our community research partner, the Chinese American Service League. We will study the fundamental mechanisms required to optimally adapt interventions focused on immigrant populations that are culturally and linguistically isolated. The proposed project seeks to expand the role of PNs, to learn more about what determines the effectiveness of PNs as health educators, how to encourage breast and cervical cancer screening, and how PNs can become trusted and respected community health workers and advocates that provide essential links between the community and the health care system for low income women in Chicago's Chinatown.  This research will assess how Chinese women interact with health information and resources via a PN team to make health decisions and access the health care system. Women comprise the largest segment of health workers, health consumers, and health decision makers for their families and communities, but are underrepresented accessing appropriate health services among Asian immigrant populations. Once women are empowered, informed health consumers, they become catalysts for social change. This proposed project aims to adapt the rapidly growing phenomenon of patient navigation into a broader effort to use community health workers for culturally competent cancer control and prevention. Our CBPR approach, grounded in the long-standing prestige of our community organization and safety net provider partners, offers the opportunity to close the loop between community-defined health problems and access to the local health care system. Because many women in Illinois already have public insurance coverage for cancer screening and follow-up but do not take advantage of this resource, this proposal has major relevance for future efforts to increase access for vulnerable populations once broader health reform laws are implemented.",Adapting patient navigation to promote cancer screening in Chicagos

"PRISM: Personalized Reminders for Immunization using Short Messaging systems DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Problem: Vaccination coverage is well below Healthy People 2010 and 2020 goals, with substantial disparities for low-income and other disadvantaged populations. Health information technology interventions that link communication technologies, like text messaging, with electronic health record data offer low-cost, scalable opportunities to foster vaccination as well as other preventive care behaviors. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of such interventions on vaccination coverage at levels in line with other forms of reminder/recall particularly in low-income populations for whom other forms of reminder-recall have not been successful. However, their effect has not been as robust as needed. More effective messaging interventions are needed.  Adolescents, in particular minority adolescents, are not adequately protected against human papillomavirus (HPV) and its potential sequelae, which include cancer and genital warts. Despite the highly efficacious vaccine being recommended for all adolescents, completion rates among those who initiate the 3- dose series are low, particularly among minorities. Using a non-randomized design, we demonstrated the effect of conventional text message vaccine reminders, notifying a parent their child was due for the next dose, in increasing HPV vaccination in primarily, urban Latina adolescents. Although much improved over controls, only 50% received their next dose on time and only 45% completed the series. While these results strongly support the potential effectiveness of this intervention in minority populations for whom traditional forms of vaccination reminders have not worked, still fewer than half completed the vaccine series.  A potential advantage of text message HIT interventions that has not been well investigated is the ability to provide personalized messages. We propose to compare the use of personalized HPV vaccine text message reminders to conventional text message reminders among minority adolescents in a pragmatic randomized trial. The trans-theoretical model of behavior change will guide the tailoring of our text messages. Specific Aim: To compare the effectiveness in improving HPV vaccine series completion for minority adolescents of personalized text message reminders with tailored vaccine-health-literacy-promoting information vs. conventional text message vaccination reminders. Methods: 956 parents of adolescent girls and boys who have received the 1st HPV vaccine dose will be randomized to receive either: 1) personalized or (2) conventional text messages. Personalized reminders include vaccine health literacy-promoting information tailored to parental stage of decision-making. Conventional text message reminders solely notify a parent their child is due for the next dose such as used in previous HPV vaccine text message studies. Outcomes: The primary outcome is completion of 3-dose HPV vaccine series within 12 months. If successful this project could support a new paradigm in interactive health communication in a low cost, scalable manner that may be readily disseminated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed translational research seeks to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the impact on HPV vaccine series completion of personalized HPV vaccination text message reminders to conventional text message reminders among minority adolescents. If successful this project could support a new paradigm in interactive health communication in a low cost, scalable, and sustainable manner that may be readily disseminated.",PRISM: Personalized Reminders for Immunization using Short Messaging systems,9075442,R01HS022677,[''],AHRQ,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,249990,0.07764163883313635
"Determinants of HPV vaccination for Hispanic parents from the Texas-Mexico border DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic women along the Texas-Mexico border experience more cases of and deaths from cervical cancer compared to the nation. Cervical cancer is preventable using the HPV vaccine, which is recommended for girls/boys and women/men aged 11-26. Compared to U.S. Hispanic girls, a smaller proportion of Texas Hispanic girls (ages 13-17) (65% vs. 58%) receive �1 dose HPV vaccine and fewer complete the vaccine series (�3 doses; 42% vs. 35%). Given the cervical cancer disparities in incidence and death among Hispanic women in this area, it is of great public health importance to promote the adoption of the vaccine and compliance with its dosing schedule. The objective of this research plan is to examine determinants of Hispanic mothers' intention to vaccinate and actual initiation and completion of the three dose series for their daughter aged 11-17. The proposed research plan seeks to: (1) identify determinants of mothers' HPV vaccine intentions, initiation and completion; (2) understand providers' perspectives on recommending the vaccine; and (3) design a culturally-relevant, theoretically grounded HPV intervention for low-income, Hispanics mothers along the Texas-Mexico border. The research is innovative because it: (1) focuses on a on a largely underserved, vulnerable population with specific needs; (2) assesses the feasibility of a clinic-based, cervical cancer prevention intervention for Hispanics mothers; and (3) focuses on the interpersonal communication between the parent, the child, and the provider. Achievement of the aims will contribute further evidence regarding the critical role of parents and providers in increasing HPV vaccine uptake and completion among girls to eliminate cervical cancer disparities among this population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a critical need to understand why there is less than optimal uptake of the HPV vaccine among Hispanic girls along the Texas-Mexico border, despite the high cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates for Hispanic women in this area. The purpose of this research is to understanding the determinants for parental intentions and acceptance of HPV vaccination and factors influencing provider's intention to recommend vaccination.

"Comparative Modeling to Inform Cervical Cancer Control Policies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite successful cervical cancer screening in the United States, over 12,000 women develop and 4,000 women die from cervical cancer each year. New technologies, including screening tests and vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually-transmitted virus known to cause cervical cancer, represent tremendous opportunities for innovative and efficient cervical cancer programs in the U.S. but also pose significant challenges for decision making, due to the complex and long natural history of disease and the different time points along the disease spectrum at which interventions are applied. Consequently, policy makers are uniquely reliant on mathematical modeling to provide evidence on the optimal cervical cancer control strategies. These models can be used to integrate the most up-to-date data, extrapolate current short- term findings into long-term outcomes, and evaluate what-if scenarios that would otherwise be impractical or infeasible to conduct in clinical studies. There has been a growing number of independent mathematical models that have been developed to address clinical and policy questions with respect to cervical cancer prevention and control but no formal efforts to compare assumptions and results across models. As part of the CISNET consortium, a group of established cervical cancer modelers from the U.S., Australia, and the Netherlands will engage in a formal collaboration of comparative modeling using a series of state-of-the-art mathematical models of HPV and cervical carcinogenesis. We will pursue analyses related to the historical impact of screening, the comparative effectiveness of current and anticipated HPV vaccination and screening strategies, and optimal routes for reducing cervical cancer disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies, including screening tests and vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually- transmitted virus known to cause cervical cancer, are dramatically changing the landscape of cervical cancer prevention in the U.S. and worldwide. In order to address important evidence gaps in cervical cancer control, we have assembled five independent research teams who have been at the frontier of modeling cervical cancer prevention over the last decade to engage in formal comparative modeling, evaluate the comparative and cost-effectiveness of screening and vaccination strategies, and disseminate results to inform health policies and decision.",Comparative Modeling to Inform Cervical Cancer Control Policies,9142309,U01CA199334,"['Australia ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cytology ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Kenya ', ' mortality ', ' Netherlands ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' South Africa ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Uganda ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Woman ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' Country ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' disease natural history ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' vaccine testing ', ' vaccine screening ', ' vaccine evaluation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' CISNET ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' Vaccinated ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' vaccination strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' comparative ', ' high risk ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' ']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,U01,2016,1607275,0.2797120041390384
"Correctional and Public Health Links to Bolster HPV Vaccine and Cancer Prevention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adults with criminal justice histories are 4-5 times more likely to get human papillomavirus (HPV) cancers compared to those without these histories, but little has been done on the front end to bolster HPV vaccination efforts among justice-involved female and male youth. Given the pathways to HPV cancer risk among justice- involved youth - early smoking, risky sexual behavior, low educational attainment, poverty, and criminal justice encounters over the life course, developing sustainable strategies to improve cancer prevention for this group of young people is important. Our project objective is to assess a pilot implementation strategy that links county juvenile detention facilities with county health departments to provide HPV vaccination for incarcerated young women and men.  To meet this objective, we propose a two-aim investigation. In Aim 1, we will pilot test our implementation strategy, Vaccines in Correctional Settings for Cancer Prevention (VCCaP pronounced Vee-Cap), where health department staff will provide an HPV vaccine clinic once per week in one Kansas county detention center for the six-month pilot implementation period. In Aim 2, we will collect information about the barriers and facilitators of such a potential linkage throughout a four-state region (Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Iowa), directly informing a subsequent R01 project to scale up our implementation strategy to the region.  For both aims, we will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as a guide to collect qualitative and quantitative data on intervention characteristics (e.g. interest in promoting intervention among jail and health department administrators); outer setting (e.g. patient perception of need in pilot setting); inner setting (e.g. norms, values of organizations that would impede or facilitae intervention success); characteristics of individuals (e.g. beliefs about HPV vaccine and implementation strategy); and process of implementation (e.g. depth of implementation and vaccine uptake in pilot setting).  Our region has the lowest HPV vaccination coverage in the country, with Kansas having the worst coverage of all 50 states. Since a recent study demonstrated that state cancer rates correlate directly with state HPV vaccination rates, innovative implementation strategies, especially among groups at high HPV risk are urgently needed. We know that HPV vaccine is an effective intervention for prevention of high-risk HPV infection and related cancers. What we do not have is information about the best implementation strategy to reach high-risk youth, particularly those in criminal justice settings. Our ultimate goal is to create a sustainable model for linkages between the correctional facilities present in most counties in the U.S. and local health departments to address the cancer and sexual health disparities that justice-involved youth face. Targeting HPV vaccination for ultimate primary prevention in a sustainable and scalable way may result in the highest short- and long-term public health gains for young people at a critical time in their lives.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our project objective is to assess a pilot implementation strategy that links county juvenile detention facilities with county health departments to provide HPV vaccination for incarcerated young women and men.

"Reducing Cervical Cancer Health Disparities among African American Women: An mHealth Approach to Improving Prevention and Treatment Outcomes African American women in the United States continue to be disproportionately burdened by cervical cancer. The incidence rate is 41% higher in black women than white women. Black women are also twice as likely to die from the disease. The 5-year survival rate is 58% for black women. It is 69% for white women. And yet, it does not have to be this way. A multifaceted preventive approach could potentially eliminate all new cases. There are a number of challenges, however, to implementing this preventive approach among African American women. Only 41% of black female adolescents have completed the 3-dose HPV vaccination series. Due to this suboptimal vaccination coverage, promotion of safer sexual practices is another key HPV prevention tool. For men, increasing male latex condom use is a behavior. For women, it is a goal. Therefore, attempts to increase condom use for women must include condom negotiation and problem-solving skills training. Finally, cervical cancer is one of the few cancers where widespread screening (and proper follow-up) can eliminate most new cases. However, the time to diagnostic resolution and treatment initiation is slowest among African American women. To combat this, community health workers (CHWs) and patient navigators (PNs) aim to improve patient outcomes across the cancer care continuum. Both have been shown to be effective. The ongoing challenge is to reduce the cost of CHW/PN services while tailoring them to the particular groups most in need. One emerging cost-effective solution is the use of mobile technology. To our knowledge, no mobile intervention has been developed to reduce cervical cancer health disparities among African American women. We intend to fill this void. Our proposed program will aim to increase HPV vaccination coverage, promote safer sexual practices, increase cervical cytology, and improve follow-up to abnormal Pap results. It will be theory-based, targeted, tailored, and personalized. The Health Belief Model will guide the development of an assessment of preventive barriers. Users will receive three types of texts: reminders for screenings and follow-ups, educational, and supportive messages. Finally, the program will include three web-based video components: scripted vignettes, unscripted peer narratives, and educational instruction. By developing an intervention using a technology that is part of the everyday lives of the overwhelming majority of African American women, the aim is to reduce cervical cancer disparities. Eight healthcare staff members will be recruited for a focus group discussion to help shape the proposed intervention. Similarly, 42 African American women will be recruited for predevelopment focus group discussions. When the prototype is completed, the 42 target end-users will return for usability testing. The usability test will include a series of tasks intended to highlight the different features of the proposed intervention. Three usability metrics will be assessed: efficiency, accuracy, and subjective satisfaction. This project aims to develop a mobile phone-based program designed to eliminate cervical cancer disparities among African American women. In clinics without established patient navigation services, the proposed intervention could be used as a stand-alone product. Alternatively, it could be integrated into existing cancer related patient navigation to further augment these services. For African American women, the skills contained in this program will help them prevent cervical cancer.",Reducing Cervical Cancer Health Disparities among African American Women: An mHealth Approach to Improving Prevention and Treatment Outcomes,9347816,R43MD011581,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communication ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Cytology ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Latex ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Socialization ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Woman ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' Privacy ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Epithelial ', ' satisfaction ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' HPV infection ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' skills training ', ' Familiarity ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' cancer care ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence ', ' Resolution ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Security ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Cancerous ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' prototype ', ' combat ', ' screening ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' ']",NIMHD,"ISA ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2017,209126,0.1867067351818295
"Application of a syndemic framework to HPV and HSV infection in emergent adult men Abstract Human papilloma virus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections account for significant morbidity in men who have sex with men (MSM). HPV is associated with oral, oropharyngeal, and anal cancers and a growing body of research suggests racial disparities in HIV burden may be partially attributed to HSV infection. Building on our ongoing cohort study (the P18 cohort study; R01DA025537) of young MSM (YMSM), we will assess anal and oral HPV, HSV-1, and HSV-2 over time. Applying a syndemic theory framework will allow examination of sociodemographic, biological, behavioral, psychosocial and structural determinants of these viral infections. Our work is informed by findings generated from the P18 cohort study including persistence of inadequate sexual health care in YMSM, incident HIV infections (7.2% to date), and a high level of infection with bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Moreover, recent evidence suggests YMSM have a very low likelihood of initiating HPV vaccination. Thus, understanding HPV and HSV infection as well as correlates and predictors will yield a more comprehensive understanding of the multiple health burdens impacting the health of YMSM. Second, understanding HPV and HSV infection in YMSM may shed light on the stark racial/ethnic disparities in HIV in YMSM. The proposed ancillary study is guided by the following aims: (1) To describe the epidemiology of overall, high-risk, low-risk, and vaccine preventable HPV infection as well as HPV vaccination uptake and completion in a racially/ethnically diverse sample of YMSM; specifically, to: (1a) estimate prevalence & incidence of anal, oral and paired co-infection of nonavalent vaccine-type HPV infection as well as correlates and risk factors for prevalent, incident, persistent, and cleared infections; (1b) prospectively estimate HPV infection and persistence as risk factors for HIV; and (1c) determine multi-level facilitators and barriers to HPV vaccination uptake and completion quantitatively and qualitatively via in-depth interviews with a sub-sample of study participants. (2) To describe the epidemiology of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in a racially/ethnically diverse sample of YMSM; specifically, to (2a) estimate prevalence & incidence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 as well as correlates and risk factors for prevalent and incident HSV-1 and HSV-2 mono- and co-infections; (2b) estimate HSV-1 and HSV-2 as risk factors for HIV acquisition, overall, and by race/ethnicity. (3) To determine prevalence and correlates of HSV/HPV co-infections and whether (a) HSV increases HPV risk, and (b) HPV infection or persistence increases HSV risk. An exploratory aim seeking to examine potential biological mechanisms linking HPV infection to HIV risk, will (1) compare local immunological response (measured via soluble cytokine levels) in the rectal microenvironment among those with and without HPV as a risk factor for HIV susceptibility. This study will provide much needed data on viral STIs in a racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of YMSM as well as provide further insights on the potential for HPV, HSV-1, and HSV-2 to influence HIV transmission and acquisition risk. Public Health Relevance Human papilloma virus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections account for significant morbidity in men who have sex with men (MSM). HPV is associated with oral, oropharyngeal, and anal cancers and a growing body of research suggests that racial disparities in HIV burden may be attributable, in part, to HSV infection.

"Correctional and Public Health Links to Bolster HPV Vaccine and Cancer Prevention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adults with criminal justice histories are 4-5 times more likely to get human papillomavirus (HPV) cancers compared to those without these histories, but little has been done on the front end to bolster HPV vaccination efforts among justice-involved female and male youth. Given the pathways to HPV cancer risk among justice- involved youth - early smoking, risky sexual behavior, low educational attainment, poverty, and criminal justice encounters over the life course, developing sustainable strategies to improve cancer prevention for this group of young people is important. Our project objective is to assess a pilot implementation strategy that links county juvenile detention facilities with county health departments to provide HPV vaccination for incarcerated young women and men.  To meet this objective, we propose a two-aim investigation. In Aim 1, we will pilot test our implementation strategy, Vaccines in Correctional Settings for Cancer Prevention (VCCaP pronounced Vee-Cap), where health department staff will provide an HPV vaccine clinic once per week in one Kansas county detention center for the six-month pilot implementation period. In Aim 2, we will collect information about the barriers and facilitators of such a potential linkage throughout a four-state region (Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Iowa), directly informing a subsequent R01 project to scale up our implementation strategy to the region.  For both aims, we will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as a guide to collect qualitative and quantitative data on intervention characteristics (e.g. interest in promoting intervention among jail and health department administrators); outer setting (e.g. patient perception of need in pilot setting); inner setting (e.g. norms, values of organizations that would impede or facilitae intervention success); characteristics of individuals (e.g. beliefs about HPV vaccine and implementation strategy); and process of implementation (e.g. depth of implementation and vaccine uptake in pilot setting).  Our region has the lowest HPV vaccination coverage in the country, with Kansas having the worst coverage of all 50 states. Since a recent study demonstrated that state cancer rates correlate directly with state HPV vaccination rates, innovative implementation strategies, especially among groups at high HPV risk are urgently needed. We know that HPV vaccine is an effective intervention for prevention of high-risk HPV infection and related cancers. What we do not have is information about the best implementation strategy to reach high-risk youth, particularly those in criminal justice settings. Our ultimate goal is to create a sustainable model for linkages between the correctional facilities present in most counties in the U.S. and local health departments to address the cancer and sexual health disparities that justice-involved youth face. Targeting HPV vaccination for ultimate primary prevention in a sustainable and scalable way may result in the highest short- and long-term public health gains for young people at a critical time in their lives.

"A Text Message Intervention to Increase HPV Vaccine Completion in Young Latinas DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Angelica Roncancio, Ph.D. is a motivated postdoctoral fellow, trained as a behavioral scientist, who is currently working at the Center for Health Promotion and Prevention Research at the University of Texas Health Science Center Houston (UTHSC-H) School of Public Health. The overall goal of this NCI K01 career development proposal is to provide Dr. Roncancio with the additional research skills necessary to launch an independent career focused on reducing HPV-related cancer disparities among Latinas. Dr. Roncancio's research examines the psychosocial and cultural determinants of cervical-cancer screening and HPV vaccination among Latinas and seeks to modify health behavior through innovative approaches to screening and vaccination completion. Under the mentorship of Dr. Maria Fernandez she will receive specialized, mentored training in the following areas: 1) cancer disparities in Latino populations, 2) the development of theory-based interventions, and 3) the use of technology in health promotion.          UTHSC-H's rich training environment provides junior investigators with the resources necessary to become independent, productive, and highly successful researchers. For example, it provides outstanding opportunities for developing skills in grant writing, manuscript publication, and project management. UTHSC-H also offers a large variety of courses, workshops, and seminars relevant to public health and behavioral science, along with access to some of the most renowned prevention scientists in cancer research.          Dr. Roncancio's long-term career goal as an independent health researcher is to improve both cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination rates, ultimately aiding in the reduction of cervical cancer disparity in Latinas. She will develop a research program focused on the development and implementation of innovative, culturally appropriate, theory-based interventions to increase cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination among underserved Latinas.          In addition, Dr. Roncancio outlines four short term goals to be achieved throughout the award period that will serve as the foundation for an independent research career: 1) to increase her science-based knowledge in behavioral theory and its application to the development of cancer interventions for underserved populations, particularly Latinas; 2) to increase her knowledge in the use of technology in interventions targeted at hard-to- reach underserved populations; 3) to increase experience in implementing interventions in hard-to-reach populations; and 4) to participate in professional development activities related to cancer health disparities. These goals will be achieved through a combination of formal coursework and directed readings, experience in implementing several research projects, experience in developing and publishing manuscripts, and intensive mentoring to ensure that Dr. Roncancio achieves each of her specific short term goals and becomes a successful independent cervical cancer disparities researcher.          The aims of the proposed research are to: 1) develop an Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction (IM) that explains Spanish-speaking Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series, and 2) develop and pilot test an innovatively-delivered IM-based intervention (via video text messaging) for Spanish-speaking Latino mothers to encourage HPV vaccine series completion for their adolescent daughters. This research is both important and timely given the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer's 2012 recommendation to increase HPV vaccination efforts to combat the rise in incidence rates of some HPV-associated cancers and the finding that Latino adolescent girls are less likely non-Latino white adolescent girls to complete the HPV vaccine series.          The proposed aims will be accomplished through four successive plans of study: 1) a qualitative study to identify the beliefs that underlie Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series; 2) a longitudinal study to identify the associations between the IM predictor variables, intentions, and behavior; 3) a usability study to evaluate the acceptability and appropriateness of the video texts to be delivered to the mothers' cellular phones that were developed to increase HPV vaccine series completion; and 4) a longitudinal pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a theory-based intervention that uses video text messaging as an innovative channel of delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will address a significant gap in our knowledge of the factors that influence Latino mothers' decisions to have their adolescent daughters complete the HPV vaccine series and will result in the development of an innovatively-delivered, theory-based intervention that may increase vaccine completion in this population. This intervention will be the first of its kind and has the potential to increase HPV vaccine completion in an underserved population known for low completion rates and for being disproportionately affected by cervical cancer disparities.",A Text Message Intervention to Increase HPV Vaccine Completion in Young Latinas,9326002,K01CA181437,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Daughter ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Mothers ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Reading ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' behavior prediction ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' experience ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Annual Reports ', ' Angelica ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Operating System ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 12 year old ', ' twelve years of age ', ' twelve year old ', ' age 12 years ', ' 12 years of age ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' usability ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K01,2017,123120,0.1961302127620193
"Addressing Cervical Cancer Disparity in South Florida CBPR in Action DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The South Florida Center for Reducing Cancer Disparities, also known as SUCCESS, supports a number of campus-community partnerships, or Community Advisory Groups (CAGs), throughout the Miami metropolitan area. Such partnerships were conceived in the spirit of Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) and facilitate meaningful collaboration between University investigators and community stakeholders in addressing issues of health disparity. The proposed project focuses on cervical cancer, a topic of significant health concern for three communities served by SUCCESS: Little Haiti, Hialeah, and West Perrine. Like other predominately minority, low-income  neighborhoods across the United States, these communities contribute to excess  cervical cancer incidence and mortality, largely due to lack of access to routine Pap  smear screening and timely follow up for detected abnormalities. SUCCESS aims to address this disparity. For the past three years, we have been engaged in a community trial comparing two innovative modalities for disease prevention: navigation to Pap smear screening at local Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) vs. home-based self-sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV), the principal cause of cervical cancer.  In both arms, Community Health Workers (CHWs) play a critical role in intervention delivery. However, our preliminary data indicate that CHW involvement may matter less than the method of screening itself. Screening uptake is significantly higher among women randomized to self-sampling in all three communities, likely given the ease of use and participant preference for home-based screening, which circumvents structural and cultural barriers to care. The proposed study will formally test the significance of CHW participation by comparing self-sampling provided by a CHW with self-sampling provided by mail. We will implement a two-arm study of 700 women from across our three target communities, with the CHW-self sampling intervention serving as our control group, or arm. Our primary aim is 1) to determine which method of self-sampling results in a greater proportion of women screened. Secondary outcomes include comparisons  of a) knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about cervical cancer and the importance of early  detection of disease~ b) access to care (health insurance, having a usual source of care,  and visit to provider in six months), particularly among women having abnormal screens  and requiring medical intervention~ and the c) relative cost of the two intervention  strategies. Consistent with the tenets of CBPR, the focus and scope of such work was informed by the SUCCESS CAGs in Little Haiti, Hialeah, and West Perrine.  By enlisting community leadership in study conceptualization, we ensure that we can successfully achieve our intended goal, to identify the most optimal strategy for cervical cancer prevention among women who disproportionately contribute to disease incidence and mortality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cervical cancer disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minorities, recent immigrants, and low-income individuals.  The proposed project aims to address this disparity through a Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) initiative that tests two innovative methods for disease prevention.

"Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Microbiota and Persistent Human Papillomavirus Detection Project Summary/Abstract Title: Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Microbiota and Persistent Human Papillomavirus Detection Abstract: In the US, there are about 7 million new genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infections with high-risk oncogenic HPV types each year. About 10% of these, or 700,000 are persistent; this is an important risk factor for cervical dysplasia and invasive cervical cancer. The dynamics of HPV infection and the subsequent development of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia are not well understood. The proposed study will characterize the temporal relationship of vaginal microbiota associated with Metronidazole treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV). It will also examine whether Metronidazole treatment of asymptomatic BV is associated with detection of oncogenic HPV and persistence of oncogenic HPV infections. The proposed pilot study will utilize existing vaginal swabs from 80 women followed over six months from the BRAVO study, a randomized controlled open labeled clinical trial examining Metronidazole treatment of asymptomatic BV. The vaginal microbiome will be characterized using high throughput 16s rRNA encoding gene pyrosequencing. The proposed research fits with priorities of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID). NCI has prioritized racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence and mortality of certain cancers and prevention or early detection of these cancers in specific populations and NIAID has set “screening, diagnosis and interventions for target populations to determine how to triage various groups for appropriate prevention, treatment and education strategies” as an overarching priority. There are also compelling public health reasons for supporting this application: In spite of the availability of prophylactic HPV vaccination, there are still more than 528,000 new cases and 266,000 deaths worldwide from cervical cancer related to persistent HPV infections each year. This innovative research will complement current HPV vaccine research by providing more data on how the dysbiosis associated with BV allows HPV to bypass vaginal defenses to infect basal epithelial cells—providing information that could contribute to more effective vaccines. It also may help inform treatment guidelines. Finally, it will build research infrastructure and opportunities for student involvement at the largest minority majority institution in the U.S. Project Narrative Persistent infection with Human Papillomavirus is the leading cause of cervical cancer. Some studies have shown that bacterial vaginosis is conducive to persistence of oncogenic HPV infection. The study will examine if treatment of bacterial vaginosis is associated with detection of HPV and persistence of HPV infection.",Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Microbiota and Persistent Human Papillomavirus Detection,9232554,R15AI128714,"['Bacteria ', ' anaerobe ', ' Anaerobic Bacteria ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervix Dysplasia ', ' Cervical dysplasia ', ' chlamydial disease ', ' Chlamydial Infection ', ' Chlamydia Infections ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Engineering ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Epithelium ', ' Florida ', ' Genes ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Investments ', ' Lactobacillus ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Medicine ', ' Metronidazole ', ' Satric ', ' Flagyl ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' mortality ', ' Mucous body substance ', ' mucous ', ' Mucus ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Students ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccines ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Woman ', ' Lactic acid ', ' Nonspecific Vaginitis ', ' Bacterial Vaginitis ', ' Bacterial Vaginosis ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Guidelines ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Uterine Cervix Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Cervix Uteri Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Cervix Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasms ', ' Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' HPV infection ', ' Research Priority ', ' Dimensions ', ' prophylactic ', ' System ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' computer science ', ' graduate student ', ' Prevention ', ' Bypass ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Swab ', ' Institution ', ' Genital Human Papilloma Virus Infection ', ' Genital Human papillomavirus Infection ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' International ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' NIAID ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Vaccine Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' open label study ', ' open label ', ' pyrosequencing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Oncogenic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' infrastructure development ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' screening ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' vaginal microbiome ', ' microbiota ', ' ']",NIAID,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R15,2017,439500,0.22215992356394534
"PRISM: Personalized Reminders for Immunization using Short Messaging systems DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Problem: Vaccination coverage is well below Healthy People 2010 and 2020 goals, with substantial disparities for low-income and other disadvantaged populations. Health information technology interventions that link communication technologies, like text messaging, with electronic health record data offer low-cost, scalable opportunities to foster vaccination as well as other preventive care behaviors. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of such interventions on vaccination coverage at levels in line with other forms of reminder/recall particularly in low-income populations for whom other forms of reminder-recall have not been successful. However, their effect has not been as robust as needed. More effective messaging interventions are needed.  Adolescents, in particular minority adolescents, are not adequately protected against human papillomavirus (HPV) and its potential sequelae, which include cancer and genital warts. Despite the highly efficacious vaccine being recommended for all adolescents, completion rates among those who initiate the 3- dose series are low, particularly among minorities. Using a non-randomized design, we demonstrated the effect of conventional text message vaccine reminders, notifying a parent their child was due for the next dose, in increasing HPV vaccination in primarily, urban Latina adolescents. Although much improved over controls, only 50% received their next dose on time and only 45% completed the series. While these results strongly support the potential effectiveness of this intervention in minority populations for whom traditional forms of vaccination reminders have not worked, still fewer than half completed the vaccine series.  A potential advantage of text message HIT interventions that has not been well investigated is the ability to provide personalized messages. We propose to compare the use of personalized HPV vaccine text message reminders to conventional text message reminders among minority adolescents in a pragmatic randomized trial. The trans-theoretical model of behavior change will guide the tailoring of our text messages. Specific Aim: To compare the effectiveness in improving HPV vaccine series completion for minority adolescents of personalized text message reminders with tailored vaccine-health-literacy-promoting information vs. conventional text message vaccination reminders. Methods: 956 parents of adolescent girls and boys who have received the 1st HPV vaccine dose will be randomized to receive either: 1) personalized or (2) conventional text messages. Personalized reminders include vaccine health literacy-promoting information tailored to parental stage of decision-making. Conventional text message reminders solely notify a parent their child is due for the next dose such as used in previous HPV vaccine text message studies. Outcomes: The primary outcome is completion of 3-dose HPV vaccine series within 12 months. If successful this project could support a new paradigm in interactive health communication in a low cost, scalable manner that may be readily disseminated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed translational research seeks to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the impact on HPV vaccine series completion of personalized HPV vaccination text message reminders to conventional text message reminders among minority adolescents. If successful this project could support a new paradigm in interactive health communication in a low cost, scalable, and sustainable manner that may be readily disseminated.",PRISM: Personalized Reminders for Immunization using Short Messaging systems,9298561,R01HS022677,[''],AHRQ,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,249989,0.07764163883313635
"Improving Cervical Cancer Prevention in the Community Health Delivery System for Post-Incarcerated Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women in the criminal justice system are four-five times as likely to have cervical cancer compared to non- incarcerated women. In our previous research, we found that the most important contributor to cervical cancer risk, and perhaps lack of follow-up, is incarcerated women's low health literacy about broader reproductive health issues. Until we effectively address incarcerated women's unique reproductive health literacy needs, the cervical cancer health disparity between incarcerated and non-incarcerated women will persist. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a sexual health empowerment (SHE Project) intervention to improve cervical health knowledge, reduce barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, improve self-efficacy for navigatin providers and health care systems, and ultimately work towards preventing cervical cancer. This objective is responsive to PAR-10-133 in that it develops an intervention strategy to address health literacy and broader health outcomes in a vulnerable population. To meet the objectives of this study, we propose to assess the impact of a sexual health empowerment intervention (SHE Project) on cervical health knowledge; barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, and self-efficacy for screening and follow-up among women leaving jail. More specifically, we will conduct a pre- and post-intervention assessment from baseline to the end of a weeklong intervention using a wait-list control design. Next, we will use a three-year observational study design employing both survey and ethnographic methods for follow-up, to understand how knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, and other factors change post-release cervical health prevention behaviors over time. This approach will allow us to observe the extent to which women translate, if at all, increased knowledge, reduced barriers, and increased self-efficacy into practice during clinical encounters, or if other factors explain health behaviors ove time. The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for this high risk and vulnerable group of women. Our development of an effective and easily disseminated health literacy intervention that can be adapted to many health conditions and broader cancer prevention efforts in institutionalized populations (jails, prisons, community corrections, military institutions) will have an impact on public health, and also on the science of developing effective health literacy interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for the high risk and vulnerable group of women in the criminal justice system.

"Increasing Uptake of Evidence Based Screening Services though a CHW-led multi-modality program: The South Florida Center for Reducing Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Miami's South Florida Center for Reducing Health Disparities (SUCCESS) aims to improve the health of South Florida's most vulnerable populations through collaborative, participatory research. Our primary focus has been to improve early detection and prevention of diseases that disproportionately affect communities, disenfranchised from the formal healthcare system. Towards this end, we have tested the effectiveness of multiple Community Health Worker (CHW)-led interventions to improve screening uptake for four priority health conditions: HIV, Hepatitis C, Colorectal Cancer (CRC), and cervical cancer. However, a major limitation of all such projects is that each has existed as distinct, standalone initiative targeting a specific community and/or individuals who meet narrow eligibility criteria. The current proposal will address this gap. We propose to develop and implement a clinical trial that offers screening for all four health conditions in a no-clinical setting, circumventing known structural and access barriers to care. Our partners in this application are our longstanding collaborators: the Health Choice Network- a consortium of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and the Center for Haitian Studies. Based on their input, we propose a pragmatic trial of 900 people ages 50-65 who self-identify as Hispanic, Haitian, and/or African and have not been appropriately screened for the aforementioned diseases of interest. Our specific aim is to determine whether a CHW led intervention, which provides innovative, home based screening increases uptake among medically underserved individuals who are in need of at least of these tests. This multi-modality approach will use oral swabs for HIV, finger stick testing for Hepatitis C, Fecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT) for CRC, and self- sampling for Human Papilloma Virus, the primary cause of cervical cancer. The proposed pragmatic trial, grounded in the tenets of community-based participatory research (CBPR), will help identify optimal strategies for delivering prevention services to medically-vulnerable population sub-groups. Our study testing innovative, cost sensitive approaches will help inform health reform strategies that increasingly prioritize population health and precision medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minority groups suffer disproportionately from conditions such as HIV, Hepatitis C, colorectal and cervical cancer. Strategies that can increase rates of screening for these conditions can help narrow such disparities. We propose a study in which community health workers use recent advances in home testing technology to see if having these screenings services done at home leads to more screenings than simply referring persons to more traditional medical care.",Increasing Uptake of Evidence Based Screening Services though a CHW-led multi-modality program: The South Florida Center for Reducing Health Disparities,9519179,U01MD010614,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' Control Groups ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Collection ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Feedback ', ' Fingers ', ' Florida ', ' Geography ', ' Haiti ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Priorities ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' hep C ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' HCV infection ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Papillomavirus ', ' Papilloma Viruses ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Privacy ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' community planning ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' metropolitan ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' prevention service ', ' Health Information System ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Swab ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Screening Result ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Community Health ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' medically underserved ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' population health ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' HIV/HCV ', ' HIV/Hepatitis C ', ' HCV/HIV ', ' Haitian ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2017,74409,0.043329158779923806
"Using Text Messaging to Increase HPV Vaccination among Young Sexual Minority Men Project Summary/Abstract Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that causes anal, penile, oropharyngeal cancers in men. Due to their sexual practices, men who have sex with men (MSM) are at particularly high risk for HPV infection and are disproportionately affected by HPV-related cancers. A safe and effective vaccine is available to prevent HPV infection, yet HPV vaccination rates in the U.S. have been low, particularly among males. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends HPV vaccination for all MSM through age 26. Nevertheless, recent studies with national samples of gay and bisexual men aged 18-26 indicate that only 13-21% have initiated the 3-dose HPV vaccine series. Our pilot work suggests that many MSM are simply unaware of the vaccine or perceive other important barriers to getting vaccinated. To remedy this gap, the goal of the proposed research is to develop and pilot test a text messaging intervention to increase HPV vaccination in young MSM. The proposed intervention combines an evidence-based approach to increasing vaccination (“reminder-recall”) with text messaging. In addition to providing basic education and a cue to action, text messages can be tailored to address specific barriers. The long-term goal of this research is to develop effective strategies for increasing HPV vaccination among MSM, thereby reducing morbidity, mortality, and disparities associated with HPV-related cancers. In response to PA- 15-263 (The Health of Sexual and Gender Minority Populations), the objective of this R21 application is to develop and pilot test a text messaging intervention to increase HPV vaccination in young adult MSM. Guided by the Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills (IMB) Model, we propose to two specific aims: (1) Develop, iteratively refine, and pre-test messages using a 5-step formative research procedure. Intended users of the program (i.e., men who identify as gay, bisexual, or queer 18-26 years old) will be recruited to assist with this process. (2) Test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the Txt4Prevention (T4P) text messaging intervention in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be randomized to the treatment (T4P) or control condition. The treatment condition will receive a culturally appropriate HPV vaccination intervention based on the IMB model, whereas the control condition will receive a general sexual health intervention that includes basic facts about HPV vaccination readily accessible online. Primary outcome measures include intervention feasibility (recruitment and retention), acceptability (satisfaction with the intervention), and preliminary efficacy as determined by initiation and completion of the 3-dose series at the end of the 9-month trial. Vaccination status will be verified by participants' medical records and the Illinois Immunization Registry. Outcomes from these aims are expected to have an important positive impact by identifying effective strategies for increasing HPV vaccination among sexual minority men. Project Narrative Men who have sex with men are at increased risk for cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), yet relatively few have been vaccinated for HPV. The goal of this project is to develop and test a text messaging- based program to increase HPV vaccination in young adult men who self-identify as gay, bisexual, or queer. If effective, this program could be implemented on a larger scale to reduce rates of HPV-related cancers in sexual minority men across the country.",Using Text Messaging to Increase HPV Vaccination among Young Sexual Minority Men,9302703,R21CA208329,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Cues ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Illinois ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' male ', ' Medical Records ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Motivation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' malignant oropharynx tumor ', ' Oropharynx Carcinoma ', ' Oropharynx Cancer ', ' Oropharyngeal Carcinoma ', ' Oropharyngeal Cancer ', ' Oropharnyx Cancers ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' malignant oropharynx neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Anus ', ' Malignant Anal Tumor ', ' Malignant Anal Neoplasm ', ' Anus Cancer ', ' Anal Cancers ', ' Anal Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of anus ', ' Penis Cancer ', ' Penile Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Penis ', ' Malignant Penile Tumor ', ' Malignant Penile Neoplasm ', ' Malignant neoplasm of penis ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' sexually active ', ' satisfaction ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' Letters ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' HPV infection ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' cancer risk ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Papillomavirus Infections ', ' papilloma virus Infections ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' High risk Human papilloma virus ', ' High risk Human Papillomavirus ', ' High risk HPV ', ' High Risk Oncogenic HPV ', ' HPV-High Risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' sexual minority ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' sexual health intervention ', ' queer ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,208815,0.07440618396686548

"Determinants of HPV vaccination for Hispanic parents from the Texas-Mexico border DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic women along the Texas-Mexico border experience more cases of and deaths from cervical cancer compared to the nation. Cervical cancer is preventable using the HPV vaccine, which is recommended for girls/boys and women/men aged 11-26. Compared to U.S. Hispanic girls, a smaller proportion of Texas Hispanic girls (ages 13-17) (65% vs. 58%) receive �1 dose HPV vaccine and fewer complete the vaccine series (�3 doses; 42% vs. 35%). Given the cervical cancer disparities in incidence and death among Hispanic women in this area, it is of great public health importance to promote the adoption of the vaccine and compliance with its dosing schedule. The objective of this research plan is to examine determinants of Hispanic mothers' intention to vaccinate and actual initiation and completion of the three dose series for their daughter aged 11-17. The proposed research plan seeks to: (1) identify determinants of mothers' HPV vaccine intentions, initiation and completion; (2) understand providers' perspectives on recommending the vaccine; and (3) design a culturally-relevant, theoretically grounded HPV intervention for low-income, Hispanics mothers along the Texas-Mexico border. The research is innovative because it: (1) focuses on a on a largely underserved, vulnerable population with specific needs; (2) assesses the feasibility of a clinic-based, cervical cancer prevention intervention for Hispanics mothers; and (3) focuses on the interpersonal communication between the parent, the child, and the provider. Achievement of the aims will contribute further evidence regarding the critical role of parents and providers in increasing HPV vaccine uptake and completion among girls to eliminate cervical cancer disparities among this population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a critical need to understand why there is less than optimal uptake of the HPV vaccine among Hispanic girls along the Texas-Mexico border, despite the high cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates for Hispanic women in this area. The purpose of this research is to understanding the determinants for parental intentions and acceptance of HPV vaccination and factors influencing provider's intention to recommend vaccination.

"EdTech-HPV: A Community Approach using Education and Technology to Increase HPV Vaccination 1 Project Summary  2 Despite the significant advantages of preventing Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the growing  3 evidence that shows the benefits of the HPV vaccine, vaccine uptake among eligible girls and boys (i.e., 9-17  4 year olds) in the U.S. has been suboptimal. Current efforts have increased vaccination rates marginally, but  5 remain low and far from the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80%. In 2013, only 37% of eligible adolescent girls  6 received the full 3 doses of the vaccine and only 15% of boys. Persistent HPV infection precedes HPV driven  7 cancers by years, in some cases decades, but if current levels of HPV driven cancer cases continue, the  8 vaccine has the potential to prevent over 25,000 cases yearly among current adolescents in the U.S. Hispanic  9 girls and boys in the U.S. have similar vaccination rates, though adult Hispanics exhibit greater HPV driven 10 cancer disparities, supporting an even stronger case to create tailored interventions to increase the vaccination 11 rates in this growing population. The most common barriers cited by Latino parents for vaccinating their 12 children are lack of knowledge about the vaccine or HPV in general and lack of provider recommendation, but 13 if recommended, most “will certainly get the vaccine for their child.” Our research has yielded a 78% 14 vaccination completion rate as compared to 17%. This pilot study is the impetus of the current proposal, to 15 conduct a larger, definitive randomized trial for the effectiveness of the EdTech-HPV (Community Approach 16 using Education and Technology to Increase HPV Vaccination) intervention among Latinos. Project goals are: 17 1: To conduct a randomized controlled trial for the effectiveness of a community-based HPV vaccination 18 program that targets Mexican-American parents of HPV vaccine eligible children. 2: To develop a multi-level 19 statistical predictive model on vaccination series completion. This intervention is based on evidence supporting 20 community based programs to increase immunizations, particularly among immigrant parents of eligible 21 children. The Mexican population in the U.S. is the largest and fastest growing Latino population. For over 10 22 years the Ventanilla de Salud (VDS) at Mexican consulates in the U.S has promoted the health of their 23 nationals and provided extensive assistance in disease prevention matters, within a safe and culturally 24 appropriate environment. Four VDS locations across the country will participate in this project (New York City, 25 Las Vegas, El Paso and Chicago) providing access to a diverse Mexican population living in dissimilar 26 environments. Parents in the study will participate in a structured, one-on-one educational session addressing 27 all aspects of HPV. A subsample will be randomly assigned to receive text messaging reminders to initiate 28 vaccination and to obtain the second and third doses. All subjects will be assessed, through provider 29 verification, for initiating their child's vaccine at completion of the doses. Achieving the aims of this project will 30 cement a replicable, community based model to reduce health disparities in the broader Latino population. Project Narrative This project seeks to provide a solution to the low rates of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among Latino children by working with and within a well established community programs that serves Latinos in the New York City area. Achieving the goals of this project has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of HPV related cancers in the Latino population.",EdTech-HPV: A Community Approach using Education and Technology to Increase HPV Vaccination,9360770,R01MD011508,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' New York City ', ' Parents ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Mexican ', ' sexually active ', ' uptake ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' HPV infection ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Text ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Population ', ' 4 year old ', ' four years of age ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 4 years of age ', ' 9 year old ', ' nine years of age ', ' nine year old ', ' age 9 years ', ' 9 years of age ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 17 years of age ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NIMHD,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2017,672053,0.12088235744427614
"Sexual Health Empowerment (SHE) for Cervical Health Literacy and Cancer Prevention Diversity Supplement DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women in the criminal justice system are four-five times as likely to have cervical cancer compared to non- incarcerated women. In our previous research, we found that the most important contributor to cervical cancer risk, and perhaps lack of follow-up, is incarcerated women's low health literacy about broader reproductive health issues. Until we effectively address incarcerated women's unique reproductive health literacy needs, the cervical cancer health disparity between incarcerated and non-incarcerated women will persist. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a sexual health empowerment (SHE Project) intervention to improve cervical health knowledge, reduce barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, improve self-efficacy for navigatin providers and health care systems, and ultimately work towards preventing cervical cancer. This objective is responsive to PAR-10-133 in that it develops an intervention strategy to address health literacy and broader health outcomes in a vulnerable population. To meet the objectives of this study, we propose to assess the impact of a sexual health empowerment intervention (SHE Project) on cervical health knowledge; barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, and self-efficacy for screening and follow-up among women leaving jail. More specifically, we will conduct a pre- and post-intervention assessment from baseline to the end of a weeklong intervention using a wait-list control design. Next, we will use a three-year observational study design employing both survey and ethnographic methods for follow-up, to understand how knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, and other factors change post-release cervical health prevention behaviors over time. This approach will allow us to observe the extent to which women translate, if at all, increased knowledge, reduced barriers, and increased self-efficacy into practice during clinical encounters, or if other factors explain health behaviors ove time. The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for this high risk and vulnerable group of women. Our development of an effective and easily disseminated health literacy intervention that can be adapted to many health conditions and broader cancer prevention efforts in institutionalized populations (jails, prisons, community corrections, military institutions) will have an impact on public health, and also on the science of developing effective health literacy interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for the high risk and vulnerable group of women in the criminal justice system.

"Mixed-Methods approach to evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of HPV+ women who have performed self-collection 7. Project summary/abstract PROJECT: Mixed-Methods approach to evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of HPV+ women who have performed self-collection Cervical cancer is a serious public health problem reflecting social and gender inequalities in health. It is the third cause of cancer death among women in the world, with more than 85% of cases occurring in developing countries. Currently, the development of new technologies based on HPV DNA detection allows HPV self- collection, increasing screening coverage. In a self-collection based strategy, triage becomes a key step in the prevention process, as it is the first method to identify HPV+ women who will need diagnostic and treatment procedures. However, high adherence to triage is difficult to obtain, which is not surprising given that adherence to follow-up and treatment is a generalized problem in cervical cancer programs. Specific aims of the study are: 1. To evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage among women with HPV+ self-collected tests compared to usual care. 2. To evaluate the implementation strategy and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the multi-component mHealth intervention. The research study design will follow the structure of an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I trial, and will use mix-method approach. A cluster randomized trial including 200 CHWs (clusters) and 4000 women will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to cytology triage at 120 days after positive HPV testing. The mHealth intervention will include SMS messages sent to HPV+ women to inform them when results are available, and subsequent SMS messages as reminders. In addition, for those HPV+ women who did not had a triage cytology result within 60 days of the HPV test result, CHWs will receive an e-mail and SMS message so they can contact these women during home visits for specific counseling and support. For the implementation evaluation, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will be used to guide qualitative data collection and analysis of factors that influence implementation. RE-AIM will be used to assess the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance of the Intervention. Results of this project will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention to increase triage of HPV+ women, but it could be adapted to increase compliance of diagnoses/ treatment of cervical cancer and other health problems. Findings from the implementation evaluation will be highly applicable to programs that use or are planning to incorporate HPV self-collection in different settings and countries. In addition, the use of CFIR and RE-AIM in this innovative study will serve as a model of work, constituting an important advance in the use of Implementation Science in the Region. 8. Project Narrative This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a of a multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage among women with HPV+ self-collected tests. In addition it will evaluate the implementation using two key frameworks: The RE-AIM and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Findings from this project are vital to inform local and regional cancer control programs about the implementation of automated SMS messages to increase adherence to triage of HPV+ women. Its methodology might be also applied to the diagnoses and treatment stages and could be adapted to other cancers, such as breast and colon cancer. In addition, this innovative study will serve as a model of work and will contribute to the consolidation of Implementation research in Latin America, which is still at its early stages of development.",Mixed-Methods approach to evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of HPV+ women who have performed self-collection,9365804,R01CA218306,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Adoption ', ' Argentina ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Colposcopy ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' Counseling ', ' Cytology ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Household ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Latin America ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' Triage ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' Gender ', ' Work Load ', ' Workload ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cervical ', ' Uterine Cervix Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Cervix Uteri Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Cervix Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasms ', ' Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Trust ', ' Inequality ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Test Result ', ' Visit ', ' innovative technologies ', ' Regional Cancer ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Prevention ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Localized Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Localized Malignancy ', ' Localized Cancer ', ' Local Cancer ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Detection ', ' Premalignant ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' Home visitation ', ' implementation research ', ' scale up ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' implementation science ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' population health ', ' screening ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' ']",NCI,CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF STATE / SOCIETY,R01,2017,407200,0.15187889089079779
"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States, yet this burden continues to disproportionately affect vulnerable populations including low-income, minority, and geographically isolated communities. Of all cancers, breast, colorectal, and cervical are those most amenable to early detection via evidence-based screening procedures. Patient navigation is an evidence-based practice to improve adherence to cancer screening as well as diagnostic and treatment guidelines among vulnerable populations. Specifically, several studies show that patient navigation improves mammography, cervical screening, and colonoscopy rates for low-income and/or racial/ethnic minority patients. While cancer prevention and control programs are increasingly using patient navigators (PNs) to facilitate healthcare access as well as continuity and quality of care among vulnerable patients, not enough is known about the scope and context of practice of these PNs nor their background and training, especially within community settings. This information is vital for optimizing the delivery of patient navigation activities both inside and outside of health systems. Identifying training and resource needs as well as disseminating best-practices among PNs may also facilitate reductions in cancer disparities. The purpose of SIP 17-003, Formative Study of Patient Navigators with the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) and the Colorectal Cancer Control Program (CRCCP), is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of PNs. The primary aim of this study is to characterize PNs working with the NBCCEDP and CRCCP including their roles and responsibilities, work environment, and training and technical assistance needs. The proposed activities will advance the science of PN interventions and will support efforts to scale-up and optimize the delivery of patient navigation services, especially within the context of NBCCEDP and CRCCP. We will achieve this aim by conducting the following activities in collaboration with CDC and NBCCEDP and CRCCP grantees: 1) identify affiliated PNs; 2) develop and administer an online survey to assess the background, training, roles and responsibilities, work environment, and training and technical assistance needs among affiliated PNs; and 3) interview a subset of approximately 30 survey respondents to elucidate key differences in experiences and training/technical assistance needs by factors such as practice setting (clinical versus non-clinical) and type of training (nurse v. health educator, for example). Our team is well-positioned to work with NBCCEDP and CRCCP grantees to conduct the proposed activities and to disseminate the findings. As part of CDC's Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network, we already collaborate with NBCCEDP and CRCCP to gather evaluation data directly from grantees, share findings with CDC and the grantees, and publish the results. Our investigators also work with federally qualified health centers and other healthcare systems in multiple states and participate in practice networks that provide opportunities for further dissemination of study findings beyond NBCCEDP and CRCCP grantees. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer prevention and control programs are increasingly using patient navigation as an evidence-based approach to facilitate continuity and quality of care among vulnerable patients, but not much is known about patient navigators' scope and context of practice. The primary aim of this study is to characterize patient navigators working with the National Breast and Cervical Early Detection Program and Colorectal Cancer Control Program, including their background, roles and responsibilities, work environment, and training and technical assistance needs.

"Web App Technology for Boys and Parents: Improving HPV Vaccine Uptake The President's Cancer Advisory Board and the Centers for Disease Control have called for renewed efforts in promoting vaccination for Human Papillomavirus (HPV), including vaccination for adolescent boys, because the uptake of this new vaccine remains alarmingly low. Currently, less than 15% of adolescent boys have received the HPV vaccine; thus, most of this population remains at risk for oropharyngeal, anal, and penile cancers. Many parents remain unconvinced of the safety and effectiveness of HPV vaccines, so effective and accessible messaging to improve decision-making on this vaccine is needed. Parents of adolescent boys also have different concerns about HPV vaccination than for adolescent girls, creating a need for unique health communication interventions to promote vaccine uptake among boys. Interventions also need to address the unique challenges of minority populations and populations for whom English is not the first language. A novel digital intervention will be produced and evaluated for its ability to improve HPV vaccine outcomes. Specifically, a mobile responsive web application (“mobile web app”) will be created that performs similar to a mobile app but runs on a variety of computing platforms from personal desktop and laptop computers to the latest smart phones and tablet computers. Mobile web app content will be targeted to parents and adolescent boys aged 11-13 years living in New Mexico, a majority-minority population with large proportions of Hispanics, Whites, and Native Americans. The specific aims are to: 1) carefully and systematically develop a mobile web app (BoyVac) for smart phones, tablet computers, and personal computers that will utilize Diffusion of Innovations principles to provide targeted information concerning HPV vaccine adoption to adolescent males and their parents, particularly minority adolescents and parents; 2) implement a comprehensive and rigorous test of the impact of the BoyVac mobile web app intervention on HPV vaccine adoption outcomes via a randomized efficacy trial (BoyVac v. usual and customary care); and 3) examine the dose-response relationships between mobile web app usage and vaccine outcomes within a components analysis. A group-randomized pretest-posttest controlled design will be implemented, recruiting 1800 pairs of parents and adolescent boys from 30 pediatric clinics (n=60 parents and boys per clinic) affiliated with the Envision New Mexico, a best practices program at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center's Department of Pediatrics. Parents will be surveyed at baseline, a 3-month follow-up, and a 9-month follow-up and records HPV vaccination adoption for the boys will be obtained from the clinics' medical records at the 9- month follow-up. Analyses will test the hypotheses that 1) more 11-13 year old boys in the intervention group (BoyVac mobile web app) will adopt the HPV vaccine than boys in the usual and customary care comparison group and 2) adoption of HPV vaccine will be mediated by improvements in theoretical mediators among parents in the intervention compared to the usual and customary care comparison group. The uptake of vaccines for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in the U.S. is far below recommended levels, particularly for adolescent boys and especially among minority families. Proposed here is a mobile web application (“mobile web app”) for personal computers, smart phones, and tablet computers that will accurately inform parents and adolescent boys about the HPV vaccination and address unique concerns about its safety and effectiveness for boys. The BoyVac mobile web app will be evaluated for its ability to improve vaccine outcomes in a randomized efficacy trial with parents and adolescent boys aged 11-13 years who obtain care in pediatric

"Implementing Cancer Prevention Using Patient - Provider Clinical Decision Support ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of U.S. adults and adolescents do not receive key evidence-based preventive care services. Rural populations are especially disadvantaged with multiple healthcare disparities, resulting in lower rates of primary and secondary cancer prevention interventions. The objective of this project is to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a sophisticated Web-based, electronic health record (EHR)-linked clinical decision support (CDS) system designed to improve primary and secondary cancer preventive care. To achieve this objective, we link EHR data to evidence-based cancer prevention algorithms in a secure Web site to: (a) identify at the point of care all eligible patients not up o date on their cancer prevention interventions; and (b) present to both patient and primary care provider (PCP) and/or a key member of the primary care team, certified medical assistant (CMA), appropriate evidence-based primary cancer prevention interventions and cancer screening options at the point of care. The Cancer Prevention-CDS will focus on breast cancer screening in women aged 50-74, colorectal cancer screening for both sexes aged 50-75, cervical cancer screening for women aged 21-65, human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination for both sexes aged 11-26, and referrals for weight management and smoking cessation in all adults aged 18 and older. Effectiveness is assessed by cluster-randomizing 30 primary care clinics with roughly 285 PCPs and 153,000 study-eligible patients into one of three experimental conditions: Group 1: PCP-focused CDS intervention in which the PCP triggers use of the CDS system and engages patients in appropriate cancer prevention strategies. Group 2: CMA-focused CDS intervention in which the CMA triggers use of the CDS system and interacts with the patient to engage them in appropriate cancer prevention strategies before seeing their PCP, who will approve or discuss the plan with their patient. Group 3 clinics provide usual care with no intervention-related activity related to cancer prevention. With 10 clinics, 95 PCPs, and 51,000 potentially eligible patients per study arm, this study will formally test the hypothesis tht Groups 1 and 2 are superior to Group 3 over an 18-month follow-up period with respect to: (a) significantly higher rates of appropriate screening for breast, cervix, and colorectal cancer, as defined by the United States Preventive Services Task Force; and (b) significantly higher rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in males and females aged 11-26 years. We further posit that Groups 1 and 2 will have higher short-term health care costs but better long-term cost-effectiveness than Group 3. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and RE-AIM conceptual frameworks will be used to guide implementation planning, organization, conduct, and impact evaluation of the intervention in a large rural healthcare system. This project will engage a rural population with substantial healthcare disparities and gaps in the receipt of primary and secondary cancer prevention. Results will advance dissemination and implementation research methods that can reduce health disparities and improve healthcare for millions in medically underserved areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If primary and secondary prevention practices for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer were improved, more than 100,000 cancer deaths a year could be delayed or averted in the United States and the burden of these diseases on quality of life reduced. In this project, we will adapt, implement, and evaluate a proven electronic health record-linked, Web-based, personalized clinical decision support system to identify patients needing primary and/or secondary cancer prevention care. The objectives of this project are to improve the quality and consistency of primary and secondary prevention of common cancers in rural areas by providing patient- centered and evidence-based treatment recommendations to both primary care provider teams and patients at the point of care and provide an efficient and effective model for implementation and dissemination of cancer prevention in rural settings.",Implementing Cancer Prevention Using Patient -

"Randomized controlled trial of an implementation science tool to increase cervical cancer screening in Mombasa, Kenya ABSTRACT Summary of Proposal: This proposal supports a 4-year research and training program to allow Dr. Eastment to make substantial progress toward a career as an independent investigator and leader in the field of women’s health and cervical cancer screening implementation. She aims to quantify the cervical cancer screening care cascade and understand the correlates of appropriate screening. She will then conduct a cluster randomized trial to test an implementation science tool, the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA), to improve cervical cancer screening for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women in Mombasa, Kenya. A budget impact analysis of SAIA will be performed for Mombasa County Department of Health (DOH). Dr. Eastment’s expertise in coordinating studies in Kenya utilizing the same implementation science tool provides a strong foundation for this proposed plan. Her training program will include further instruction in study design, economic evaluations, analysis of correlated data, and implementation science from leaders in these fields, leveraging on the outstanding research and training environments at the University of Washington (UW), and the strength of long- term collaborations with Mombasa County. Her collection of mentors from the UW Departments of Medicine, Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Global health, along with her collaborators from Mombasa County, are eager to mentor and support Dr. Eastment’s project and career development. Research Plan: Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women in sub-Saharan Africa, and the majority of cervical cancer mortality occur in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Many of the disparities between high and LMICs are attributed to differences in screening. Kenyan guidelines recommend screening with visual inspection methods followed by treatment of pre-cancerous lesions with cryotherapy and loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). Implementation of these are poor with only 14% of Kenyan women ever having been screened for cervical cancer as of 2014. To address this implementation gap, this application proposes three aims. In Aim 1, we will describe the cervical cancer screening care cascade, from identification of female clients age 21-65 years old, through referral for follow-up of clients with positive or suspicious screens, in family planning (FP) clinics in Mombasa County. Following characterization of this cascade, we will conduct an analysis of correlates of failure to screen for cervical cancer in FP clients seen over a one-year period in Mombasa County. Aim 2 will test whether SAIA increases cervical cancer screening compared to usual procedures in a cluster randomized trial in 20 FP clinics in Mombasa County. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the cost and budget impact of using SAIA to increase cervical cancer screening in FP clinics in Mombasa County. The results of this study have the potential to improve cervical cancer screening, and inform policy in the Mombasa DOH for a fiscally responsible evidenced-based approach for cervical cancer screening. The long-term goal is to decrease cervical cancer mortality and improve women’s health. NARRATIVE McKenna Eastment, MD, MPH is a Senior Fellow/Acting Instructor in the Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the Department of Medicine at the University of Washington. This K08 award, with the career development plan and research proposal, aims to provide Dr. Eastment with mentorship in conducting a clinical trial testing an implementation science tool to improve cervical cancer screening for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women in Mombasa, Kenya. These research findings have the potential for generalizability throughout Kenya and to other low and middle-income countries to decrease cervical cancer mortality by increasing screening and improving linkage to treatment of pre-cancerous lesions.","Randomized controlled trial of an implementation science tool to increase cervical cancer screening in Mombasa, Kenya",9619246,K08CA228761,"['Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Budgets ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Career Mobility ', ' career transition ', ' career advancement ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Family Planning ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Cold Therapy ', ' Therapeutic Cold ', ' Cryotherapy ', ' Cytology ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Kenya ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Sexual Health Empowerment for Cervical Health Literacy and Cancer Prevention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women in the criminal justice system are four-five times as likely to have cervical cancer compared to non- incarcerated women. In our previous research, we found that the most important contributor to cervical cancer risk, and perhaps lack of follow-up, is incarcerated women's low health literacy about broader reproductive health issues. Until we effectively address incarcerated women's unique reproductive health literacy needs, the cervical cancer health disparity between incarcerated and non-incarcerated women will persist. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a sexual health empowerment (SHE Project) intervention to improve cervical health knowledge, reduce barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, improve self-efficacy for navigatin providers and health care systems, and ultimately work towards preventing cervical cancer. This objective is responsive to PAR-10-133 in that it develops an intervention strategy to address health literacy and broader health outcomes in a vulnerable population. To meet the objectives of this study, we propose to assess the impact of a sexual health empowerment intervention (SHE Project) on cervical health knowledge; barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, and self-efficacy for screening and follow-up among women leaving jail. More specifically, we will conduct a pre- and post-intervention assessment from baseline to the end of a weeklong intervention using a wait-list control design. Next, we will use a three-year observational study design employing both survey and ethnographic methods for follow-up, to understand how knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, and other factors change post-release cervical health prevention behaviors over time. This approach will allow us to observe the extent to which women translate, if at all, increased knowledge, reduced barriers, and increased self-efficacy into practice during clinical encounters, or if other factors explain health behaviors ove time. The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for this high risk and vulnerable group of women. Our development of an effective and easily disseminated health literacy intervention that can be adapted to many health conditions and broader cancer prevention efforts in institutionalized populations (jails, prisons, community corrections, military institutions) will have an impact on public health, and also on the science of developing effective health literacy interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for the high risk and vulnerable group of women in the criminal justice system. An empowerment approach to health literacy interventions will also have an impact on broader reproductive health problems in this high risk population. Further, the development of an effective and easily disseminated health literacy intervention that can be adapted to many health conditions and broader cancer prevention efforts in institutionalized populations (jails, prisons, community corrections, military institutions) will have an impact on public health, and also on the science of developing effective health literacy interventions.",Sexual Health Empowerment for Cervical Health Literacy and Cancer Prevention,9598089,R01CA181047,"['Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Life Experience ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literacy Programs ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Prisons ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Clinical ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Reproductive Health ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' health knowledge ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' cancer risk ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' empowerment ', ' Prevention ', ' reproductive ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Jail ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' post intervention ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' ethnographic method ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' health empowerment ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' sexual violence ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' screening ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,159320,0.07124646640588116
"Web App Technology for Boys and Parents: Improving HPV Vaccine Uptake The President's Cancer Advisory Board and the Centers for Disease Control have called for renewed efforts in promoting vaccination for Human Papillomavirus (HPV), including vaccination for adolescent boys, because the uptake of this new vaccine remains alarmingly low. Currently, less than 15% of adolescent boys have received the HPV vaccine; thus, most of this population remains at risk for oropharyngeal, anal, and penile cancers. Many parents remain unconvinced of the safety and effectiveness of HPV vaccines, so effective and accessible messaging to improve decision-making on this vaccine is needed. Parents of adolescent boys also have different concerns about HPV vaccination than for adolescent girls, creating a need for unique health communication interventions to promote vaccine uptake among boys. Interventions also need to address the unique challenges of minority populations and populations for whom English is not the first language. A novel digital intervention will be produced and evaluated for its ability to improve HPV vaccine outcomes. Specifically, a mobile responsive web application (“mobile web app”) will be created that performs similar to a mobile app but runs on a variety of computing platforms from personal desktop and laptop computers to the latest smart phones and tablet computers. Mobile web app content will be targeted to parents and adolescent boys aged 11-13 years living in New Mexico, a majority-minority population with large proportions of Hispanics, Whites, and Native Americans. The specific aims are to: 1) carefully and systematically develop a mobile web app (BoyVac) for smart phones, tablet computers, and personal computers that will utilize Diffusion of Innovations principles to provide targeted information concerning HPV vaccine adoption to adolescent males and their parents, particularly minority adolescents and parents; 2) implement a comprehensive and rigorous test of the impact of the BoyVac mobile web app intervention on HPV vaccine adoption outcomes via a randomized efficacy trial (BoyVac v. usual and customary care); and 3) examine the dose-response relationships between mobile web app usage and vaccine outcomes within a components analysis. A group-randomized pretest-posttest controlled design will be implemented, recruiting 1800 pairs of parents and adolescent boys from 30 pediatric clinics (n=60 parents and boys per clinic) affiliated with the Envision New Mexico, a best practices program at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center's Department of Pediatrics. Parents will be surveyed at baseline, a 3-month follow-up, and a 9-month follow-up and records HPV vaccination adoption for the boys will be obtained from the clinics' medical records at the 9- month follow-up. Analyses will test the hypotheses that 1) more 11-13 year old boys in the intervention group (BoyVac mobile web app) will adopt the HPV vaccine than boys in the usual and customary care comparison group and 2) adoption of HPV vaccine will be mediated by improvements in theoretical mediators among parents in the intervention compared to the usual and customary care comparison group. The uptake of vaccines for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in the U.S. is far below recommended levels, particularly for adolescent boys and especially among minority families. Proposed here is a mobile web application (“mobile web app”) for personal computers, smart phones, and tablet computers that will accurately inform parents and adolescent boys about the HPV vaccination and address unique concerns about its safety and effectiveness for boys. The BoyVac mobile web app will be evaluated for its ability to improve vaccine outcomes in a randomized efficacy trial with parents and adolescent boys aged 11-13 years who obtain care in pediatric

"Implementing Cancer Prevention Using Patient - Provider Clinical Decision Support ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of U.S. adults and adolescents do not receive key evidence-based preventive care services. Rural populations are especially disadvantaged with multiple healthcare disparities, resulting in lower rates of primary and secondary cancer prevention interventions. The objective of this project is to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a sophisticated Web-based, electronic health record (EHR)-linked clinical decision support (CDS) system designed to improve primary and secondary cancer preventive care. To achieve this objective, we link EHR data to evidence-based cancer prevention algorithms in a secure Web site to: (a) identify at the point of care all eligible patients not up o date on their cancer prevention interventions; and (b) present to both patient and primary care provider (PCP) and/or a key member of the primary care team, certified medical assistant (CMA), appropriate evidence-based primary cancer prevention interventions and cancer screening options at the point of care. The Cancer Prevention-CDS will focus on breast cancer screening in women aged 50-74, colorectal cancer screening for both sexes aged 50-75, cervical cancer screening for women aged 21-65, human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination for both sexes aged 11-26, and referrals for weight management and smoking cessation in all adults aged 18 and older. Effectiveness is assessed by cluster-randomizing 30 primary care clinics with roughly 285 PCPs and 153,000 study-eligible patients into one of three experimental conditions: Group 1: PCP-focused CDS intervention in which the PCP triggers use of the CDS system and engages patients in appropriate cancer prevention strategies. Group 2: CMA-focused CDS intervention in which the CMA triggers use of the CDS system and interacts with the patient to engage them in appropriate cancer prevention strategies before seeing their PCP, who will approve or discuss the plan with their patient. Group 3 clinics provide usual care with no intervention-related activity related to cancer prevention. With 10 clinics, 95 PCPs, and 51,000 potentially eligible patients per study arm, this study will formally test the hypothesis tht Groups 1 and 2 are superior to Group 3 over an 18-month follow-up period with respect to: (a) significantly higher rates of appropriate screening for breast, cervix, and colorectal cancer, as defined by the United States Preventive Services Task Force; and (b) significantly higher rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in males and females aged 11-26 years. We further posit that Groups 1 and 2 will have higher short-term health care costs but better long-term cost-effectiveness than Group 3. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and RE-AIM conceptual frameworks will be used to guide implementation planning, organization, conduct, and impact evaluation of the intervention in a large rural healthcare system. This project will engage a rural population with substantial healthcare disparities and gaps in the receipt of primary and secondary cancer prevention. Results will advance dissemination and implementation research methods that can reduce health disparities and improve healthcare for millions in medically underserved areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If primary and secondary prevention practices for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer were improved, more than 100,000 cancer deaths a year could be delayed or averted in the United States and the burden of these diseases on quality of life reduced. In this project, we will adapt, implement, and evaluate a proven electronic health record-linked, Web-based, personalized clinical decision support system to identify patients needing primary and/or secondary cancer prevention care. The objectives of this project are to improve the quality and consistency of primary and secondary prevention of common cancers in rural areas by providing patient- centered and evidence-based treatment recommendations to both primary care provider teams and patients at the point of care and provide an efficient and effective model for implementation and dissemination of cancer prevention in rural settings.",Implementing Cancer Prevention Using Patient -

"Cervical, Anal & Oral HPV Persistence/Adolescent Girls The period from adolescence to emerging adulthood is characterized by multiple developmental transitions and peak incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Hispanic and African-American women are at high risk for HPV-associated and other sexually transmitted diseases, including cervical cancer and Chlamydia. Subsequent to the approval and release of the quadrivalent (Gardasil) HPV vaccine in 2007, we initiated a prospective cohort study of sexually-active, inner-city, minority women (aged 12-19) attending the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center (MSAHC), the largest comprehensive adolescent primary care facility in the U.S. We observed higher rates of HPV infection and associated cervical cytological abnormalities post-vaccination among subjects immunized at age 15 or older who took ≥12 months (vs. <12 months) to complete the 3-dose vaccine schedule. Furthermore, we found evidence for increased risk of cervical infection with HPV vaccine types and other STIs among subjects with a history of exposure to psycho-social risk indicators reflecting family disadvantage, psychological distress, and history of childhood abuse/neglect. Last year, the FDA approved a new 9-valent HPV vaccine with a reduced dosing schedule for younger adolescents based on evidence from short term bridging studies of primarily Caucasian and low-risk women with limited numbers of sexual partners. This study will assess the real-world effectiveness of the new vaccine in a high-risk minority population. This unique study cohort also provides opportunities to explore new and innovative areas of research relevant to adolescent health in women, especially with respect to other STIs, and the cervicovaginal microbiome. This is of particular relevance since STI rates are high in this population, with a third acquiring Chlamydia. In addition, we observed that certain types of bacteria found in the cervical specimens from women in our study were associated with increased risks of Chlamydia and HPV infection. Furthermore we hypothesize that the impact of chronic stress and risky behaviors leading to STIs and breakthrough HPV infections may be influenced in part by changes in the cervicovaginal microbiome. To address these health disparities in minority young women, we are proposing to expand our existing cohort and recruit an additional 1108 women with prospective follow-up to age 30 to: 1) determine whether there is a reduction in the incidence of cervical, anal and oral HPV infection and incidence of cervical cytological abnormalities among 9-valent versus quadrivalent HPV vaccinees; 2) study the association between cervicovaginal microbiome and risk of HPV and STIs; and 3) assess the complex associations between psycho-social factors including history of childhood abuse/neglect and risk of HPV and STIs. Data obtained from this study will be essential to understanding the long-term impacts of HPV vaccination in high-risk, minority women not studied in the vaccine trials, and will provide the biological underpinnings for future screening practices, as well as estimating the potential impact of the cervicovaginal microbiome and psycho-social factors on risk of HPV and STIs. Minority youth have the highest rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including chlamydia and human papillomavirus (HPV). This study investigates the continued burden of HPV and other STIs in a population of predominantly Hispanic and African-American inner-city adolescent and young adult women. The study will also estimate the potential impact of the vaginal microbial environment, and behavioral and social factors, on the risks of HPV and STIs. Data from this study will be essential to understanding the long-term impacts of HPV vaccination and the biological underpinnings for future screening practices.","Cervical, Anal & Oral HPV Persistence/Adolescent Girls",9473411,R01AI072204,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Bacteria ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Child Abuse ', ' Childhood Abuse ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia trachomatis ', ' Rickettsia trachomae ', ' C. trachomatis ', ' C trachomatis ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cytology ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health care facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Schedule ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' Cervical ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' sexually active ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' Exposure to ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' HPV infection ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' psychosocial ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' high risk behavior ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' abuse neglect ', ' neglect and abuse ', ' psychological distress ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Vaccinated ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' High risk Human papilloma virus ', ' High risk Human Papillomavirus ', ' High risk HPV ', ' High Risk Oncogenic HPV ', ' HPV-High Risk ', ' Gardasil ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' fifteen years of age ', ' fifteen year old ', ' age 15 years ', ' 15 years of age ', ' 15 year old ', ' next generation vaccines ', ' new vaccines ', ' novel vaccines ', ' high risk ', ' FDA approved ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' emerging adulthood ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' young woman ', ' screening ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' vaccine study ', ' vaccination trial ', ' vaccination study ', ' vaccine trial ', ' adolescent health ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' Immunize ', ' recruit ', ' early screening ', ' cervicovaginal microbiome ', ' ']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,927425,0.2134338138225169
"Social Determinants of HPV Vaccine Completion among Adolescents ABSTRACT The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. and is responsible for causing 70 to 90 percent of all genital, anal, and oral cancers. Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by these outcomes. Vaccination during adolescence is recommended before sexual activity to prevent HPV and associated cancers. However, national adolescent vaccine rates remain low with completion rates lower than initiation rates, especially among minority youth. Recently, the number of doses required for vaccine completion among some age groups has been reduced. For example, only two doses are now required for vaccine completion for adolescents ages 11 to 14, while adolescents ages 15 to 17 remain on the three-dose series. Despite these changes, the HPV vaccine series remains on a 6- month administration schedule for completion. The gap between vaccine initiation and completion rates and disparities in HPV vaccination may be influenced by social determinants. To date, the majority of studies have explored individual-level determinants to refusing or starting the HPV vaccine series. Much less is known regarding determinants of vaccine completion, especially relationship and community level factors. The purpose of this study is to identify individual-, relationship-, and community-level determinants of HPV vaccine completion among adolescents ages 11 to 14 and barriers and facilitators to completion among parents and adolescents. More specifically we aim to: 1) Determine the effects of social determinants of health for adolescent HPV vaccine completion (age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance type, area deprivation index for residence, and distance to clinic) within a 14-month period using EHR data from retrospective chart reviews; and 2) Explore barriers and facilitators to vaccine completion by describing parent and adolescent experiences with the HPV vaccine, including individual, relationship, and community level determinants influencing vaccine completion, and integrating interview data with social determinants explored in Aim 1. A parallel mixed-methods design will be used to integrate information from electronic health records (EHR) with qualitative data from individual interviews with parents and adolescents to determine social determinants influencing vaccine completion. A modified version of the Social Ecological Model will be used as a guide to understand various determinants affecting HPV vaccine completion across three levels: Individual, relationship, and community. Thirty-two adolescents and parents will be recruited from a local pediatric clinic. Quantitative data will be analyzed using logistic regressions and directed content analysis will be used to analyze interview data. Results from both analyses will be presented using data displays where an integrative summary will provide further description of how determinants serve as barriers and facilitators to vaccine completion. Findings from this study will guide future research on multi-level intervention studies that prioritize social determinants of HPV vaccination completion to reduce barriers experienced among parents and adolescents. PROJECT NARRATIVE The HPV vaccine helps prevent HPV infections and related cancers when all doses of the vaccine are received; however, many teenagers are not getting all the doses. This study seeks to provide a comprehensive description on why teenagers and parents do not complete the HPV vaccine. Findings from this study will help inform interventions that can increase vaccine completion rates among teenagers to reduce their risk of developing cancers in the future.",Social Determinants of HPV

"Determinants of HPV vaccination for Hispanic parents from the Texas-Mexico border DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic women along the Texas-Mexico border experience more cases of and deaths from cervical cancer compared to the nation. Cervical cancer is preventable using the HPV vaccine, which is recommended for girls/boys and women/men aged 11-26. Compared to U.S. Hispanic girls, a smaller proportion of Texas Hispanic girls (ages 13-17) (65% vs. 58%) receive �1 dose HPV vaccine and fewer complete the vaccine series (�3 doses; 42% vs. 35%). Given the cervical cancer disparities in incidence and death among Hispanic women in this area, it is of great public health importance to promote the adoption of the vaccine and compliance with its dosing schedule. The objective of this research plan is to examine determinants of Hispanic mothers' intention to vaccinate and actual initiation and completion of the three dose series for their daughter aged 11-17. The proposed research plan seeks to: (1) identify determinants of mothers' HPV vaccine intentions, initiation and completion; (2) understand providers' perspectives on recommending the vaccine; and (3) design a culturally-relevant, theoretically grounded HPV intervention for low-income, Hispanics mothers along the Texas-Mexico border. The research is innovative because it: (1) focuses on a on a largely underserved, vulnerable population with specific needs; (2) assesses the feasibility of a clinic-based, cervical cancer prevention intervention for Hispanics mothers; and (3) focuses on the interpersonal communication between the parent, the child, and the provider. Achievement of the aims will contribute further evidence regarding the critical role of parents and providers in increasing HPV vaccine uptake and completion among girls to eliminate cervical cancer disparities among this population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a critical need to understand why there is less than optimal uptake of the HPV vaccine among Hispanic girls along the Texas-Mexico border, despite the high cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates for Hispanic women in this area. The purpose of this research is to understanding the determinants for parental intentions and acceptance of HPV vaccination and factors influencing provider's intention to recommend vaccination. Findings will guide the development of an evidence-based intervention to increase initiation and completion of the HPV vaccine among Hispanics girls.",Determinants of HPV vaccination for Hispanic parents from the Texas-Mexico border,9554846,K01CA181530,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Daughter ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mexico ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Woman ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Personal Communication ', ' Interpersonal Communication ', ' Schedule ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' pediatrician ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' parental role ', ' parent role ', ' research study ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' career development ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Human papillomavirus 6 ', ' Human papillomavirus type 6 ', ' Human papilloma virus type 6 ', ' Human papilloma virus 6 ', ' HPV6 ', ' HPV 6 ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' recruit ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2018,105517,0.2601422330903955
"Mixed-Methods approach to evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of HPV+ women who have performed self-collection 7. Project summary/abstract PROJECT: Mixed-Methods approach to evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of HPV+ women who have performed self-collection Cervical cancer is a serious public health problem reflecting social and gender inequalities in health. It is the third cause of cancer death among women in the world, with more than 85% of cases occurring in developing countries. Currently, the development of new technologies based on HPV DNA detection allows HPV self- collection, increasing screening coverage. In a self-collection based strategy, triage becomes a key step in the prevention process, as it is the first method to identify HPV+ women who will need diagnostic and treatment procedures. However, high adherence to triage is difficult to obtain, which is not surprising given that adherence to follow-up and treatment is a generalized problem in cervical cancer programs. Specific aims of the study are: 1. To evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage among women with HPV+ self-collected tests compared to usual care. 2. To evaluate the implementation strategy and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the multi-component mHealth intervention. The research study design will follow the structure of an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I trial, and will use mix-method approach. A cluster randomized trial including 200 CHWs (clusters) and 4000 women will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to cytology triage at 120 days after positive HPV testing. The mHealth intervention will include SMS messages sent to HPV+ women to inform them when results are available, and subsequent SMS messages as reminders. In addition, for those HPV+ women who did not had a triage cytology result within 60 days of the HPV test result, CHWs will receive an e-mail and SMS message so they can contact these women during home visits for specific counseling and support. For the implementation evaluation, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will be used to guide qualitative data collection and analysis of factors that influence implementation. RE-AIM will be used to assess the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance of the Intervention. Results of this project will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention to increase triage of HPV+ women, but it could be adapted to increase compliance of diagnoses/ treatment of cervical cancer and other health problems. Findings from the implementation evaluation will be highly applicable to programs that use or are planning to incorporate HPV self-collection in different settings and countries. In addition, the use of CFIR and RE-AIM in this innovative study will serve as a model of work, constituting an important advance in the use of Implementation Science in the Region. 8. Project Narrative This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a of a multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage among women with HPV+ self-collected tests. In addition it will evaluate the implementation using two key frameworks: The RE-AIM and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Findings from this project are vital to inform local and regional cancer control programs about the implementation of automated SMS messages to increase adherence to triage of HPV+ women.

"Comparative Modeling to Inform Cervical Cancer Control Policies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite successful cervical cancer screening in the United States, over 12,000 women develop and 4,000 women die from cervical cancer each year. New technologies, including screening tests and vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually-transmitted virus known to cause cervical cancer, represent tremendous opportunities for innovative and efficient cervical cancer programs in the U.S. but also pose significant challenges for decision making, due to the complex and long natural history of disease and the different time points along the disease spectrum at which interventions are applied. Consequently, policy makers are uniquely reliant on mathematical modeling to provide evidence on the optimal cervical cancer control strategies. These models can be used to integrate the most up-to-date data, extrapolate current short- term findings into long-term outcomes, and evaluate what-if scenarios that would otherwise be impractical or infeasible to conduct in clinical studies. There has been a growing number of independent mathematical models that have been developed to address clinical and policy questions with respect to cervical cancer prevention and control but no formal efforts to compare assumptions and results across models. As part of the CISNET consortium, a group of established cervical cancer modelers from the U.S., Australia, and the Netherlands will engage in a formal collaboration of comparative modeling using a series of state-of-the-art mathematical models of HPV and cervical carcinogenesis. We will pursue analyses related to the historical impact of screening, the comparative effectiveness of current and anticipated HPV vaccination and screening strategies, and optimal routes for reducing cervical cancer disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies, including screening tests and vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually- transmitted virus known to cause cervical cancer, are dramatically changing the landscape of cervical cancer prevention in the U.S. and worldwide. In order to address important evidence gaps in cervical cancer control, we have assembled five independent research teams who have been at the frontier of modeling cervical cancer prevention over the last decade to engage in formal comparative modeling, evaluate the comparative and cost-effectiveness of screening and vaccination strategies, and disseminate results to inform health policies and decision.",Comparative Modeling to Inform Cervical Cancer Control Policies,9538154,U01CA199334,"['Australia ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cytology ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Kenya ', ' mortality ', ' Netherlands ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' South Africa ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Uganda ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Woman ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' Country ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' disease natural history ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Subgroup ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' CISNET ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' Vaccinated ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' vaccination strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' comparative ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' comparative cost effectiveness ', ' clinical development ', ' sexually transmitted virus ', ' ']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,U01,2018,1443554,0.2797120041390384
"Framing HPV Vaccination Messages for African American Parents PROJECT SUMMARY The 2014 President’s Cancer Panel called underuse of HPV vaccines “a serious, but correctable threat to progress against cancer.” The Cancer Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel, more recently, identified expanding the use of HPV vaccines as a top priority for cancer prevention, especially in medically underserved populations. The overarching goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel, theory-based message framing intervention to accelerate HPV vaccine uptake among African American adolescents. Based on prospect theory and the health belief model, this project aims to 1) develop culturally appropriate messages framed in gains and losses and pretest these messages through community engagement; 2) determine whether/how the effects of message framing (gain vs. loss) on African American parents’ acceptance of the HPV vaccine are moderated by their prior beliefs about HPV and the HPV vaccine; and 3) evaluate the efficacy of a message framing intervention rooted in message targeting principles utilizing mobile tablets for efficient targeting through a clinic-based randomized trial. The proposed project will generate key insights into the persuasive effects of message framing as applied to the promotion of HPV vaccination. It will produce solid empirical evidence surrounding a novel, theory-based message framing intervention aimed at accelerating HPV vaccine uptake among African American adolescents. Addressing a critical aspect of health disparities disadvantaging the African American community, this research represents a systematic and timely effort to respond to the call of the 2014 President’s Cancer Panel on the urgency of optimizing communication strategies for promoting HPV vaccination among key stakeholders. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project addresses a major public health concern – low HPV vaccination rates among adolescents – and represents a timely effort to develop effective communication interventions for promoting HPV vaccination. By examining HPV vaccination communication strategies that resonate with African American parents, the proposed project also addresses critical health disparities in HPV-related cancers. With its focus on developing and evaluating a theory-based message framing intervention, the proposed project will not only advance communication science bearing direct relevance to public health promotion, particularly the promotion of HPV vaccination, but also make a significant step forward toward translating basic behavioral science underlying vaccine communication into community-based interventions.",Framing HPV Vaccination Messages for African American Parents,9519460,R01CA219060,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Attitude ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Belief ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Exercise ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Interview ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Woman ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' base ', ' Solid ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' HPV infection ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' age group ', ' novel ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', "" President's Cancer Panel "", ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' Basic Behavioral Science ', ' twelve years of age ', ' twelve year old ', ' age 12 years ', ' 12 years of age ', ' 12 year old ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young man ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' young woman ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' persistent infection ', ' chronic infection ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,442195,0.14594476763234612
"Sexual Health Empowerment for Cervical Health Literacy and Cancer Prevention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women in the criminal justice system are four-five times as likely to have cervical cancer compared to non- incarcerated women. In our previous research, we found that the most important contributor to cervical cancer risk, and perhaps lack of follow-up, is incarcerated women's low health literacy about broader reproductive health issues. Until we effectively address incarcerated women's unique reproductive health literacy needs, the cervical cancer health disparity between incarcerated and non-incarcerated women will persist. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a sexual health empowerment (SHE Project) intervention to improve cervical health knowledge, reduce barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, improve self-efficacy for navigatin providers and health care systems, and ultimately work towards preventing cervical cancer. This objective is responsive to PAR-10-133 in that it develops an intervention strategy to address health literacy and broader health outcomes in a vulnerable population. To meet the objectives of this study, we propose to assess the impact of a sexual health empowerment intervention (SHE Project) on cervical health knowledge; barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, and self-efficacy for screening and follow-up among women leaving jail. More specifically, we will conduct a pre- and post-intervention assessment from baseline to the end of a weeklong intervention using a wait-list control design. Next, we will use a three-year observational study design employing both survey and ethnographic methods for follow-up, to understand how knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, and other factors change post-release cervical health prevention behaviors over time. This approach will allow us to observe the extent to which women translate, if at all, increased knowledge, reduced barriers, and increased self-efficacy into practice during clinical encounters, or if other factors explain health behaviors ove time. The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for this high risk and vulnerable group of women. Our development of an effective and easily disseminated health literacy intervention that can be adapted to many health conditions and broader cancer prevention efforts in institutionalized populations (jails, prisons, community corrections, military institutions) will have an impact on public health, and also on the science of developing effective health literacy interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for the high risk and vulnerable group of women in the criminal justice system. An empowerment approach to health literacy interventions will also have an impact on broader reproductive health problems in this high risk population. Further, the development of an effective and easily disseminated health literacy intervention that can be adapted to many health conditions and broader cancer prevention efforts in institutionalized populations (jails, prisons, community corrections, military institutions) will have an impact on public health, and also on the science of developing effective health literacy interventions.",Sexual Health Empowerment for Cervical Health Literacy and Cancer Prevention,9457374,R01CA181047,"['Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Life Experience ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literacy Programs ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Prisons ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Clinical ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Reproductive Health ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' health knowledge ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' cancer risk ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' empowerment ', ' Prevention ', ' reproductive ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Jail ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' post intervention ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' ethnographic method ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' health empowerment ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' sexual violence ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' screening ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,313325,0.07124646640588116
"Multi-level Optimization of the Cervical Cancer Screening Process in Diverse Settings & Populations (METRICS) ABSTRACT For more than 5 decades, the US has sought to lower cervical cancer deaths through screening; however, disparities remain. Introduction of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV)-based tests and HPV vaccines have expanded cervical cancer prevention strategies and changed screening and management guidelines. As technology, guidelines, and policies change, our MultilEvel OpTimization of the CeRvIcal Cancer Screening Process in Diverse Settings & Populations (METRICS) PROSPR II Research Center will elucidate multilevel factors that hamper or facilitate the cervical cancer screening process and reduce disparities in vulnerable populations. METRICS unites three PROSPR I Research Centers with demonstrated capability to provide validated data for a combined cohort of ~1.2 million screened and unscreened women. Our community settings represent 3 care delivery models—safety-net system, managed care system, and primary care provider networks in Texas, Washington, and Massachusetts. We will collect, harmonize, and document > 10 years of high-quality, comprehensive cervical cancer screening process data at the patient, provider, clinic, and system levels using a rich array of electronic clinical information systems and novel data sources. Our combined cohort is socioeconomically and geographically diverse and includes vulnerable groups such as HIV-infected and uninsured women. Our three interconnected observational projects are designed to understand how cervical cancer screening is delivered across our spectrum of delivery models, and how to optimize the screening process to reduce disparities. Innovative geospatial and Bayesian statistical methods in Project 1 will better elucidate at what levels variation in screening process occurs. Project 2 will investigate how multilevel programs and policies influence adherence to guidelines for average-risk women. Project 3 will inform precision screening for women with altered risk. Based on our observational findings, in years 4-5, we will design and implement pilot interventions leveraging IT-enabled tools to address key failures in the screening process and reduce disparities. Our transdisciplinary team has epidemiologists, primary and specialty care physicians, and intervention, implementation, and healthcare delivery experts. We are poised to efficiently evaluate the full cervical cancer screening process and provide expertise, leadership, and resources for cross-organ PROSPR II collaborations. Our cores and research projects will achieve our goals of advancing understanding of screening as practiced in community settings through: (1) analysis of multilevel observational data from our heterogeneous settings with diverse populations, (2) development and testing of impactful interventions to optimize the screening process, and (3) application of our novel observational projects and quality metrics to the cancer screening processes for other organs. Based on our successful experience leading and collaborating in PROSPR I, we thoughtfully organized our four cores to be able to launch research activities and contribute to trans-PROSPR II activities quickly and effectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE The METRICS PROSPR II Research Center will study delivery of cervical cancer screening and treatment in three diverse U.S. community healthcare systems. Recently, guidelines for screening and treatment have become more complex with introduction of new tests and prevention methods (HPV vaccine). We will examine how programs and policies influence the care that women receive, the ideal personalized screening strategy for women with lower or higher cancer risk (such as HIV+), and the impact of pilot interventions to improve care, with a focus on reducing disparities.",Multi-level Optimization of the Cervical Cancer Screening Process in Diverse Settings & Populations

"mHealth-supported telecolposcopy for cervical cancer programs in low-resource settings. ABSTRACT Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death among women in Peru, and 80% of cervical cancer cases are detected at advanced, incurable stages. Early identification and treatment of precancerous lesions is critical for reducing cervical cancer progression and mortality. Before treatment can be offered, women with suspected pre-cancer or cancer at screening are referred for an additional visit where confirmatory diagnosis is provided using colposcopy - a technique where a low-powered microscope is used to inspect for cervical lesions. However, loss-to-follow-up for these additional visits is as high as 50% in some regions of Peru, creating a bottleneck for women who need treatment. One approach for mitigating this bottleneck is to improve access to colposcopy for women where they live, i.e., in community settings. In partnership with La Liga Peruana de Lucha Contra el Cancer (The Peruvian League for the Fight against Cancer) and the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MINSA), the proposed study will evaluate the efficacy of an mHealth-supported telecolposcopy approach in communities within Lima Province, Peru. During the study, midwives conducting community-based screening will acquire cervical images using a low-cost ultraportable colposcope, and receive remote feedback from expert colposcopists using a mobile device. The central hypothesis is that access to expert colposcopists using an mHealth-supported telecolposcopy approach will improve the quality and timeliness of patient triage in community-based settings, increasing the proportion of women who receive a diagnosis, and adhere to treatment. The specific aims are: (1) to identify processes within the screening workflow that facilitate or inhibit effective implementation of mHealth-supported telecolposcopy, (2) to pilot test mHealth-supported telecolposcopy in a community-based setting in women who have a positive screen test based on either visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), Pap smear, or both, and (3) to evaluate efficacy of mHealth-supported telecolposcopy for improving rate of colposcopies in women who are screen-positive compared to women referred for conventional referral colposcopy. Our proposal is significant because community-based colposcopy can improve the convenience and accuracy of triaging women as those who do or do not need treatment. The anticipated cost-effectiveness of reducing two visits into one, boosts significance and scalability of this approach. Global prioritization of reduction of cervical cancer burden and disparities, high rates of mobile phone subscriptions among families in Peru, and growing investments in telemedicine infrastructure by MINSA further support the significance and feasibility of the proposed approach. The proposed study is innovative as it reframes the standard of care by using telemedicine to allow women to receive colposcopic evaluations in the communities where they live, precluding need for additional and distant clinical visits for diagnosis of cervical lesions. Results will inform an R01 study comprising a randomized controlled trial measuring clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the mHealth-supported telecolposcopy approach, as well as, integration with the national cervical cancer program in Peru with support from MINSA. RELEVANCE Early screening and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions is a cost-effective strategy for reducing preventable mortality in cervical cancer; however, the need for an additional colposcopy visit prior to treatment is a bottleneck for women with suspected cancer or pre-cancer in Peru. In this study, we seek to evaluate the efficacy of an mHealth-supported telecolposcopy approach for boosting rates of colposcopies among women in community settings in Lima Province, where access to expert colposcopists is limited. Results will inform a randomized controlled trial measuring clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the mHealth-supported telecolposcopy approach, and in the future, integration of the mHealth-supported telecolposcopy approach within the national cervical cancer program in Peru with support from the Ministry of Health.",mHealth-supported telecolposcopy for cervical cancer programs in low-resource settings.,9554307,R21TW011223,"['Acetic Acids ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Colposcopy ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Midwife ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Peru ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Measures ', ' Rural Community ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' colpospectroscope ', ' Colposcopes ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cervical ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' Visual ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Remote Consultation ', ' programs ', ' Distant ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' Modality ', ' Bypass ', ' reproductive ', ' Early identification ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Premalignant ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Province ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Science ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Preventative screening ', ' Preventive screening ', ' cost ', ' fight against ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' screening ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' Patient Triage ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' Peruvian ', ' remote communities ', ' early screening ', ' preventable mortality ', ' preventable death ', ' ']",FIC,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,190214,0.22697092927146553
"Sexual Health Empowerment for Cervical Health Literacy and Cancer Prevention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women in the criminal justice system are four-five times as likely to have cervical cancer compared to non- incarcerated women. In our previous research, we found that the most important contributor to cervical cancer risk, and perhaps lack of follow-up, is incarcerated women's low health literacy about broader reproductive health issues. Until we effectively address incarcerated women's unique reproductive health literacy needs, the cervical cancer health disparity between incarcerated and non-incarcerated women will persist. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a sexual health empowerment (SHE Project) intervention to improve cervical health knowledge, reduce barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, improve self-efficacy for navigatin providers and health care systems, and ultimately work towards preventing cervical cancer. This objective is responsive to PAR-10-133 in that it develops an intervention strategy to address health literacy and broader health outcomes in a vulnerable population. To meet the objectives of this study, we propose to assess the impact of a sexual health empowerment intervention (SHE Project) on cervical health knowledge; barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, and self-efficacy for screening and follow-up among women leaving jail. More specifically, we will conduct a pre- and post-intervention assessment from baseline to the end of a weeklong intervention using a wait-list control design. Next, we will use a three-year observational study design employing both survey and ethnographic methods for follow-up, to understand how knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, and other factors change post-release cervical health prevention behaviors over time. This approach will allow us to observe the extent to which women translate, if at all, increased knowledge, reduced barriers, and increased self-efficacy into practice during clinical encounters, or if other factors explain health behaviors ove time. The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for this high risk and vulnerable group of women. Our development of an effective and easily disseminated health literacy intervention that can be adapted to many health conditions and broader cancer prevention efforts in institutionalized populations (jails, prisons, community corrections, military institutions) will have an impact on public health, and also on the science of developing effective health literacy interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for the high risk and vulnerable group of women in the criminal justice system. An empowerment approach to health literacy interventions will also have an impact on broader reproductive health problems in this high risk population.

"A Secondary Analysis to Identify HPV Vaccination Disparities across Hispanic Subgroups in the United States PROJECT SUMMARY: Hispanics are the largest racial/ethnic minority population in the United States (US) and experience several disparities related to human papillomavirus (HPV), including Hispanic women having the highest cervical cancer incidence rate of any racial/ethnic group in the country. HPV vaccine is recommended for adolescents and young adults in the US, and estimates of HPV vaccine coverage among Hispanic adolescents vary, though recent national data suggest that vaccine coverage is similar to or slightly higher than other racial/ethnic groups. However, a key and recurring limitation of existing HPV vaccine research is that Hispanics have been aggregated and examined as a single, homogeneous group in analyses. Hispanics are in fact a heterogeneous population, with the term “Hispanic” referring to persons of Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Central American, South American, or other Spanish descent. There are striking differences between these Hispanic subgroups on immigration histories, demographics, and health behaviors and outcomes, and aggregating them in past HPV vaccine research has likely masked important subgroup differences. Unmasking and accounting for these subgroup disparities is an important component of planning health promotion programs for Hispanics (e.g., HPV vaccine interventions and surveillance efforts). Our long-term goal is to understand how HPV vaccination outcomes differ across Hispanic subgroups and then apply this understanding to increase vaccine coverage. The proposed study will take the first step in achieving this goal by analyzing existing data from the 2012-2016 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) to identify existing HPV vaccination disparities across Hispanic subgroups. The NIS-Teen is considered the gold standard of US vaccination data, and analyses will include a large, national sample of Hispanic adolescents (n=16,381) and be well-powered to identify subgroup disparities. The proposed study will determine how Hispanic subgroups differ in terms of current HPV vaccine coverage among adolescents (Aim 1), multi-level correlates of HPV vaccine coverage (Aim 2), potential barriers to parents vaccinating their children against HPV (Aim 3), and the validity of parent-reported HPV vaccination data (Aim 4). Each study aim will address a unique research question and together will provide a novel and comprehensive understanding of how HPV vaccination outcomes differ across Hispanic subgroups. We anticipate that Hispanic subgroup differences will be identified within each study aim. The resulting subgroup-specific data will greatly impact both the development (i.e., current HPV vaccine coverage, correlates, and barriers) and evaluation (i.e., validity of parent-reported data) of HPV vaccine interventions and surveillance efforts for Hispanics. PROJECT NARRATIVE: A key and recurring limitation of existing HPV vaccine research is that Hispanics have been aggregated and examined as a single, homogeneous group in analyses, an approach that has likely masked disparities between Hispanic subgroups.

"Smartphone Confocal Endoscopy for Detecting Cervical Precancer Project Summary/Abstracts Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). More than 80% of the 530,000 annual cervical cancer cases and 270,000 annual cervical cancer-related deaths occur in LMICs. Lack of resources for conducting organized screening and treatment services in LMICs leads to late stage diagnosis of cervical malignancy. As a result of this resource shortage, cervical cancer associated mortality rate in east African countries is 27.6 per 100,000, which is unacceptably high when compared to 2.3 per 100,000 in the US. Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and HPV tests are the two low-cost screening approaches commonly utilized in LMICs. Several studies showed that cervical cancer incidence rate can be reduced by screening with HPV and VIA tests and treating the patient accordingly. However, main drawback of the VIA and HPV tests is low specificity, as most women with a positive screening result (80% to 90%) will not have significant cervical malignancy that warrants treatment (i.e., cervical precancer or cancer). The resulting overtreatment exposes low-risk women to unnecessary morbidity and poses a strain on resources. Confocal microscopy provides both high sensitivity (93-100%) and specificity (93-100%) in detecting cervical precancer but its utility in LMICs has been limited due to the high device cost (>$50,000). We are proposing a new approach of accurately diagnosing cervical precancer with a low-cost (<$3,000) smartphone confocal endoscope and providing adequate treatment in a single visit. In this approach, suspected cervical lesions are imaged in vivo with the smartphone confocal endoscope. Cellular morphologies visualized in confocal images are quantitatively analyzed to diagnose cervical precancer and adequate treatment is performed during the same visit. Our approach will improve patient care in two areas: i) with high specificity of confocal microscopy, we will be able to reduce unnecessary overtreatment; and ii) with the low device cost, we will enhance a single- visit, “screen-and-treat” method in rural clinics. In this R21 project, we will develop the smartphone confocal endoscope and conduct a pilot study of imaging cervix in vivo in Uganda. We have previously developed a low- cost smartphone confocal microscope and have demonstrated in vivo confocal skin imaging in Uganda. In this project, we are translating the smartphone confocal microscopy technology for cervical imaging by developing a miniature endoscopic catheter. In Aim 1, we will develop a smartphone confocal endoscope for imaging cervix. We will optimally design i) a low-cost smartphone confocal module that connects with ii) a miniature endoscopic catheter and test the imaging performance. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate in vivo confocal imaging of cervix in patients in Uganda. Confocal images will be analyzed in comparison with corresponding histologic images and preliminary analysis will be conducted on diagnostic accuracy. We strongly believe that our low- cost, smartphone confocal microscopy technology will greatly improve the early diagnosis of a range of conditions, with the ultimate goal of helping to reduce health disparity around the globe. Project Narrative We will develop a portable imaging technique, called a smartphone confocal endoscope, that can visualize cellular details of human cervix in vivo without taking a biopsy. We will utilize the smartphone confocal endoscope to detect cervical precancer in Uganda, where early diagnosis can lead to improved survival of this potentially deadly disease. In future, this device can also be adapted to provide a low-cost diagnostic tool for other diseases in both resource poor and resource rich settings.",Smartphone Confocal Endoscopy for Detecting Cervical Precancer,9554683,R21TW011222,"['Acetic Acids ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Colposcopy ', ' Cytoplasm ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endoscopes ', ' Endoscopy ', ' endoscopic imaging ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Uganda ', ' Woman ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Catheters ', ' Cell Density ', ' Custom ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Lateral ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' Visual ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Scanning ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' Nuclear ', ' Visit ', ' Malignant neoplasm of esophagus ', ' oesophageal cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Esophagus ', ' Malignant Esophageal Tumor ', ' Malignant Esophageal Neoplasm ', ' Esophagus Cancer ', ' Esophageal Cancer ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' Histopathology ', ' Devices ', ' portability ', ' Skin ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Screening Result ', ' cell morphology ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' standard of care ', ' screening ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3D Print ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' histologic image ', ' histological image ', ' imaging study ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' smartphone Application ', ' treatment services ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2018,195752,0.21754850561068048
"EdTech-HPV: A Community Approach using Education and Technology to Increase HPV Vaccination 1 Project Summary  2 Despite the significant advantages of preventing Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the growing  3 evidence that shows the benefits of the HPV vaccine, vaccine uptake among eligible girls and boys (i.e., 9-17  4 year olds) in the U.S. has been suboptimal. Current efforts have increased vaccination rates marginally, but  5 remain low and far from the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80%. In 2013, only 37% of eligible adolescent girls  6 received the full 3 doses of the vaccine and only 15% of boys. Persistent HPV infection precedes HPV driven  7 cancers by years, in some cases decades, but if current levels of HPV driven cancer cases continue, the  8 vaccine has the potential to prevent over 25,000 cases yearly among current adolescents in the U.S. Hispanic  9 girls and boys in the U.S. have similar vaccination rates, though adult Hispanics exhibit greater HPV driven 10 cancer disparities, supporting an even stronger case to create tailored interventions to increase the vaccination 11 rates in this growing population. The most common barriers cited by Latino parents for vaccinating their 12 children are lack of knowledge about the vaccine or HPV in general and lack of provider recommendation, but 13 if recommended, most “will certainly get the vaccine for their child.” Our research has yielded a 78% 14 vaccination completion rate as compared to 17%. This pilot study is the impetus of the current proposal, to 15 conduct a larger, definitive randomized trial for the effectiveness of the EdTech-HPV (Community Approach 16 using Education and Technology to Increase HPV Vaccination) intervention among Latinos. Project goals are: 17 1: To conduct a randomized controlled trial for the effectiveness of a community-based HPV vaccination 18 program that targets Mexican-American parents of HPV vaccine eligible children. 2: To develop a multi-level 19 statistical predictive model on vaccination series completion. This intervention is based on evidence supporting 20 community based programs to increase immunizations, particularly among immigrant parents of eligible 21 children. The Mexican population in the U.S. is the largest and fastest growing Latino population. For over 10 22 years the Ventanilla de Salud (VDS) at Mexican consulates in the U.S has promoted the health of their 23 nationals and provided extensive assistance in disease prevention matters, within a safe and culturally 24 appropriate environment. Four VDS locations across the country will participate in this project (New York City, 25 Las Vegas, El Paso and Chicago) providing access to a diverse Mexican population living in dissimilar 26 environments. Parents in the study will participate in a structured, one-on-one educational session addressing 27 all aspects of HPV. A subsample will be randomly assigned to receive text messaging reminders to initiate 28 vaccination and to obtain the second and third doses. All subjects will be assessed, through provider 29 verification, for initiating their child's vaccine at completion of the doses. Achieving the aims of this project will 30 cement a replicable, community based model to reduce health disparities in the broader Latino population. Project Narrative This project seeks to provide a solution to the low rates of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among Latino children by working with and within a well established community programs that serves Latinos in the New York City area.

"Increasing Uptake of Evidence Based Screening Services though a CHW-led multi-modality program: The South Florida Center for Reducing Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Miami's South Florida Center for Reducing Health Disparities (SUCCESS) aims to improve the health of South Florida's most vulnerable populations through collaborative, participatory research. Our primary focus has been to improve early detection and prevention of diseases that disproportionately affect communities, disenfranchised from the formal healthcare system. Towards this end, we have tested the effectiveness of multiple Community Health Worker (CHW)-led interventions to improve screening uptake for four priority health conditions: HIV, Hepatitis C, Colorectal Cancer (CRC), and cervical cancer. However, a major limitation of all such projects is that each has existed as distinct, standalone initiative targeting a specific community and/or individuals who meet narrow eligibility criteria. The current proposal will address this gap. We propose to develop and implement a clinical trial that offers screening for all four health conditions in a no-clinical setting, circumventing known structural and access barriers to care. Our partners in this application are our longstanding collaborators: the Health Choice Network- a consortium of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and the Center for Haitian Studies. Based on their input, we propose a pragmatic trial of 900 people ages 50-65 who self-identify as Hispanic, Haitian, and/or African and have not been appropriately screened for the aforementioned diseases of interest. Our specific aim is to determine whether a CHW led intervention, which provides innovative, home based screening increases uptake among medically underserved individuals who are in need of at least of these tests. This multi-modality approach will use oral swabs for HIV, finger stick testing for Hepatitis C, Fecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT) for CRC, and self- sampling for Human Papilloma Virus, the primary cause of cervical cancer. The proposed pragmatic trial, grounded in the tenets of community-based participatory research (CBPR), will help identify optimal strategies for delivering prevention services to medically-vulnerable population sub-groups. Our study testing innovative, cost sensitive approaches will help inform health reform strategies that increasingly prioritize population health and precision medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minority groups suffer disproportionately from conditions such as HIV, Hepatitis C, colorectal and cervical cancer. Strategies that can increase rates of screening for these conditions can help narrow such disparities. We propose a study in which community health workers use recent advances in home testing technology to see if having these screenings services done at home leads to more screenings than simply referring persons to more traditional medical care.",Increasing Uptake of Evidence Based Screening Services though a CHW-led multi-modality program: The South Florida Center for Reducing Health Disparities,9581301,U01MD010614,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Control Groups ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Collection ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Feedback ', ' Fingers ', ' Florida ', ' Geography ', ' Haiti ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' hep C ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Papillomavirus ', ' Papillomaviridae ', ' Papilloma Viruses ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Privacy ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' community planning ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' metropolitan ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' prevention service ', ' Health Information System ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Swab ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Screening Result ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' medically underserved ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' population health ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' Haitian ', ' secondary analysis ', ' minority communities ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' recruit ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' healthcare management ', ' health management ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2018,148818,0.043329158779923806
"Policy- and Provider-Level Determinants of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Disparities Among Young U.S. Women PROJECT SUMMARY Guided by Taplin et al.’s model of multilevel influences of the cancer care continuum, the proposed project investigates how state health policies and provider-level factors influence human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among sexual and racial/ethnic minority women. The project’s two specific aims are to: (1) examine the effect of state Medicaid expansions and HPV vaccine policies on HPV vaccination initiation among sexual and racial/ethnic minority U.S. women aged 15-25 years and (2) explore health care providers’ beliefs, attitudes, decision-making processes, and practices related to HPV vaccination among adolescent and young adult sexual and racial/ethnic minority women. I will address Aim 1 by using state-level data from the National Conference of State Legislatures and individual-level 2011-2015 National Survey of Family Growth data to conduct a difference-in-difference analysis that uses multivariable linear regression to assess the association between the implementation of state Medicaid expansions and HPV vaccine policies and the proportion of U.S. women aged 15-25 years who initiated HPV vaccination in relation to both sexual orientation identity and race/ethnicity (separately). I will address Aim 2 by conducting 30 in-depth interviews with health care providers selected using a purposive sampling approach and recruited from four Boston-area community health centers that provide care to underserved populations. I will analyze the provider interview transcripts using immersion/crystallization, the template organizing style of qualitative data analysis, discourse analysis, and within- and cross-case analysis. By engaging in mentored research with Dr. Deborah Bowen (Mentor) and collaborators, completing coursework, and participating in seminars, conferences, and regular mentoring meetings, I will develop expertise in three new areas critical to my development as an interdisciplinary, independent investigator who examines how factors at not only the patient but also the provider and policy levels influence cancer screening and prevention disparities: health services research, health policy, and advanced econometrics. Moreover, I will extend my grant writing and oral presentation skills by participating in grant writing courses and presenting at research meetings and seminars. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health offers junior scholars with the intellectual and practical resources they need to develop into successful independent investigators, including junior faculty seminars, grant writing, editing, and review services, and opportunities for intellectual exchange and collaboration with senior colleagues. A K01 award will provide me with the research experience, skills, and mentorship I need to build a cutting-edge independent research program that examines how factors at the patient, provider, and policy levels influence the utilization of cervical and other cancer prevention and screening services among underserved U.S. women and men. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although sexual and racial/ethnic minority women are at high risk of acquiring human papillomavirus (HPV) and developing cervical cancer, they are less likely than heterosexual and white women, respectively, to receive the HPV vaccine. Few studies have sought to empirically identify what underlying factors drive sexual orientation and racial/ethnic disparities in HPV vaccination among women, and this limited research has mostly focused on the role of individual-level health care factors – which is insufficient for informing interventions that effectively address disparities and prevent unnecessary suffering and deaths due to HPV-related cancers. The proposed 3-year project will thus focus on how factors at two critically important contextual levels most amenable to intervention – namely, the state health policy (i.e., Medicaid expansions, HPV vaccine policies) and provider (i.e., HPV vaccination beliefs, attitudes, decision-making, practices) levels – shape sexual orientation and racial/ethnic disparities in HPV vaccination among

"Characterizing Disparities and Elucidating Opportunities Across the Cervical Cancer Continuum among Native American Women PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although cervical cancer is a preventable disease, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) women suffer from substantially lower cervical cancer screening rates, disproportionately higher cervical cancer incidence rates; and are more often diagnosed at distant stages of the disease than their non-Native counterparts. Despite progress in reducing the overall cervical cancer rate in the U.S., the higher (and increasing) incidence rate among AI/AN women, and the unfavorable profile of local versus advanced stage of disease at diagnosis, indicate a continued need for aggressive and comprehensive screening and timely follow-up of abnormal results. At a time when efficacious and well-known cervical cancer control interventions such as Pap screening, testing for human papillomavirus (HPV), and HPV vaccinations are widely available, these stark disparities across the cervical cancer continuum are alarming for AI/AN women and reflect a significant public health problem. This study will aim to fill in these critical gaps in knowledge, understanding, and translation by utilizing linked data for AI/AN women in the IHS Epi Data Mart with women in the highly unique New Mexico HPV Pap Registry (NMHPVPR) to characterize cervical cancer screening coverage, rates and intensity, failures in cervical cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment, and correlates of cervical screening with HPV vaccination among AI/AN women. Our aims are to use the linked dataset to: a) reduce any racial misclassification of AI/AN women in the NMHPVPR and characterize cervical cancer screening coverage, intensity, intervals, and annual screening rates and to identify disparities in screening among AI/AN women registered at IHS/Tribal/Urban (I/T/U) health care facilities in New Mexico; b) assess failures in follow-up to abnormal Pap/HPV tests, and treatment following a diagnosis of cervical precancer among New Mexican AI/AN women and to geospatially analyze the failures so as to guide targeted interventions in the areas of most need; and c) to estimate HPV vaccination coverage, vaccine dose delivery, and screening initiation by HPV vaccination status in AI/AN women attending I/T/U facilities. The overarching premise of this study is that comprehensive elucidation of the specific pathways through which failures occur among AI/AN women across the cervical cancer continuum will inform cost-effective and data-driven strategies for intervention that can mitigate the pervasive health disparities witnessed among this underserved population. Study findings will be translated into several peer-reviewed manuscripts and will be translated into reports and presentations to inform tribal leadership and I/T/U administrators/providers about key opportunities for improvement. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to link two existing datasets – the New Mexico Human Papilloma Virus Pap Registry and the Indian Health Service Epi Data Mart to: a) reduce any racial misclassification of AI/AN women in the NMHPVPR and characterize cervical cancer screening coverage, intensity, intervals, and annual screening rates and to identify disparities in screening among AI/AN women registered at IHS/Tribal/Urban (I/T/U) health care facilities in New Mexico; b) assess failures in follow-up to abnormal Pap/HPV tests, and treatment following a diagnosis of cervical precancer among New Mexican AI/AN women and to geospatially analyze the failures so as to guide targeted interventions in the areas of most need; and c) to estimate HPV vaccination coverage, vaccine dose delivery, and screening initiation by HPV vaccination status in AI/AN women attending I/T/U facilities.

"Smartphone Confocal Endoscopy for Detecting Cervical Preancer Project Summary/Abstracts Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). More than 80% of the 530,000 annual cervical cancer cases and 270,000 annual cervical cancer-related deaths occur in LMICs. Lack of resources for conducting organized screening and treatment services in LMICs leads to late stage diagnosis of cervical malignancy. As a result of this resource shortage, cervical cancer associated mortality rate in east African countries is 27.6 per 100,000, which is unacceptably high when compared to 2.3 per 100,000 in the US. Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and HPV tests are the two low-cost screening approaches commonly utilized in LMICs. Several studies showed that cervical cancer incidence rate can be reduced by screening with HPV and VIA tests and treating the patient accordingly. However, main drawback of the VIA and HPV tests is low specificity, as most women with a positive screening result (80% to 90%) will not have significant cervical malignancy that warrants treatment (i.e., cervical precancer or cancer). The resulting overtreatment exposes low-risk women to unnecessary morbidity and poses a strain on resources. Confocal microscopy provides both high sensitivity (93-100%) and specificity (93-100%) in detecting cervical precancer but its utility in LMICs has been limited due to the high device cost (>$50,000). We are proposing a new approach of accurately diagnosing cervical precancer with a low-cost (<$3,000) smartphone confocal endoscope and providing adequate treatment in a single visit. In this approach, suspected cervical lesions are imaged in vivo with the smartphone confocal endoscope. Cellular morphologies visualized in confocal images are quantitatively analyzed to diagnose cervical precancer and adequate treatment is performed during the same visit. Our approach will improve patient care in two areas: i) with high specificity of confocal microscopy, we will be able to reduce unnecessary overtreatment; and ii) with the low device cost, we will enhance a single- visit, “screen-and-treat” method in rural clinics. In this R21 project, we will develop the smartphone confocal endoscope and conduct a pilot study of imaging cervix in vivo in Uganda. We have previously developed a low- cost smartphone confocal microscope and have demonstrated in vivo confocal skin imaging in Uganda. In this project, we are translating the smartphone confocal microscopy technology for cervical imaging by developing a miniature endoscopic catheter. In Aim 1, we will develop a smartphone confocal endoscope for imaging cervix. We will optimally design i) a low-cost smartphone confocal module that connects with ii) a miniature endoscopic catheter and test the imaging performance. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate in vivo confocal imaging of cervix in patients in Uganda. Confocal images will be analyzed in comparison with corresponding histologic images and preliminary analysis will be conducted on diagnostic accuracy. We strongly believe that our low- cost, smartphone confocal microscopy technology will greatly improve the early diagnosis of a range of conditions, with the ultimate goal of helping to reduce health disparity around the globe. Project Narrative We will develop a portable imaging technique, called a smartphone confocal endoscope, that can visualize cellular details of human cervix in vivo without taking a biopsy. We will utilize the smartphone confocal endoscope to detect cervical precancer in Uganda, where early diagnosis can lead to improved survival of this potentially deadly disease.

"EdTech-HPV: A Community Approach using Education and Technology to Increase HPV Vaccination 1 Project Summary  2 Despite the significant advantages of preventing Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the growing  3 evidence that shows the benefits of the HPV vaccine, vaccine uptake among eligible girls and boys (i.e., 9-17  4 year olds) in the U.S. has been suboptimal. Current efforts have increased vaccination rates marginally, but  5 remain low and far from the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80%. In 2013, only 37% of eligible adolescent girls  6 received the full 3 doses of the vaccine and only 15% of boys. Persistent HPV infection precedes HPV driven  7 cancers by years, in some cases decades, but if current levels of HPV driven cancer cases continue, the  8 vaccine has the potential to prevent over 25,000 cases yearly among current adolescents in the U.S. Hispanic  9 girls and boys in the U.S. have similar vaccination rates, though adult Hispanics exhibit greater HPV driven 10 cancer disparities, supporting an even stronger case to create tailored interventions to increase the vaccination 11 rates in this growing population. The most common barriers cited by Latino parents for vaccinating their 12 children are lack of knowledge about the vaccine or HPV in general and lack of provider recommendation, but 13 if recommended, most “will certainly get the vaccine for their child.” Our research has yielded a 78% 14 vaccination completion rate as compared to 17%. This pilot study is the impetus of the current proposal, to 15 conduct a larger, definitive randomized trial for the effectiveness of the EdTech-HPV (Community Approach 16 using Education and Technology to Increase HPV Vaccination) intervention among Latinos. Project goals are: 17 1: To conduct a randomized controlled trial for the effectiveness of a community-based HPV vaccination 18 program that targets Mexican-American parents of HPV vaccine eligible children. 2: To develop a multi-level 19 statistical predictive model on vaccination series completion. This intervention is based on evidence supporting 20 community based programs to increase immunizations, particularly among immigrant parents of eligible 21 children. The Mexican population in the U.S. is the largest and fastest growing Latino population. For over 10 22 years the Ventanilla de Salud (VDS) at Mexican consulates in the U.S has promoted the health of their 23 nationals and provided extensive assistance in disease prevention matters, within a safe and culturally 24 appropriate environment. Four VDS locations across the country will participate in this project (New York City, 25 Las Vegas, El Paso and Chicago) providing access to a diverse Mexican population living in dissimilar 26 environments. Parents in the study will participate in a structured, one-on-one educational session addressing 27 all aspects of HPV. A subsample will be randomly assigned to receive text messaging reminders to initiate 28 vaccination and to obtain the second and third doses. All subjects will be assessed, through provider 29 verification, for initiating their child's vaccine at completion of the doses. Achieving the aims of this project will 30 cement a replicable, community based model to reduce health disparities in the broader Latino population. Project Narrative This project seeks to provide a solution to the low rates of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among Latino children by working with and within a well established community programs that serves Latinos in the New York City area.

"mHealth-supported telecolposcopy for cervical cancer programs in low-resource settings. ABSTRACT Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death among women in Peru, and 80% of cervical cancer cases are detected at advanced, incurable stages. Early identification and treatment of precancerous lesions is critical for reducing cervical cancer progression and mortality. Before treatment can be offered, women with suspected pre-cancer or cancer at screening are referred for an additional visit where confirmatory diagnosis is provided using colposcopy - a technique where a low-powered microscope is used to inspect for cervical lesions. However, loss-to-follow-up for these additional visits is as high as 50% in some regions of Peru, creating a bottleneck for women who need treatment. One approach for mitigating this bottleneck is to improve access to colposcopy for women where they live, i.e., in community settings. In partnership with La Liga Peruana de Lucha Contra el Cancer (The Peruvian League for the Fight against Cancer) and the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MINSA), the proposed study will evaluate the efficacy of an mHealth-supported telecolposcopy approach in communities within Lima Province, Peru. During the study, midwives conducting community-based screening will acquire cervical images using a low-cost ultraportable colposcope, and receive remote feedback from expert colposcopists using a mobile device. The central hypothesis is that access to expert colposcopists using an mHealth-supported telecolposcopy approach will improve the quality and timeliness of patient triage in community-based settings, increasing the proportion of women who receive a diagnosis, and adhere to treatment. The specific aims are: (1) to identify processes within the screening workflow that facilitate or inhibit effective implementation of mHealth-supported telecolposcopy, (2) to pilot test mHealth-supported telecolposcopy in a community-based setting in women who have a positive screen test based on either visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), Pap smear, or both, and (3) to evaluate efficacy of mHealth-supported telecolposcopy for improving rate of colposcopies in women who are screen-positive compared to women referred for conventional referral colposcopy. Our proposal is significant because community-based colposcopy can improve the convenience and accuracy of triaging women as those who do or do not need treatment. The anticipated cost-effectiveness of reducing two visits into one, boosts significance and scalability of this approach. Global prioritization of reduction of cervical cancer burden and disparities, high rates of mobile phone subscriptions among families in Peru, and growing investments in telemedicine infrastructure by MINSA further support the significance and feasibility of the proposed approach. The proposed study is innovative as it reframes the standard of care by using telemedicine to allow women to receive colposcopic evaluations in the communities where they live, precluding need for additional and distant clinical visits for diagnosis of cervical lesions. Results will inform an R01 study comprising a randomized controlled trial measuring clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the mHealth-supported telecolposcopy approach, as well as, integration with the national cervical cancer program in Peru with support from MINSA. RELEVANCE Early screening and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions is a cost-effective strategy for reducing preventable mortality in cervical cancer; however, the need for an additional colposcopy visit prior to treatment is a bottleneck for women with suspected cancer or pre-cancer in Peru. In this study, we seek to evaluate the efficacy of an mHealth-supported telecolposcopy approach for boosting rates of colposcopies among women in community settings in Lima Province, where access to expert colposcopists is limited. Results will inform a randomized controlled trial measuring clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the mHealth-supported telecolposcopy approach, and in the future, integration of the mHealth-supported telecolposcopy approach within the national cervical cancer program in Peru with support from the Ministry of Health.",mHealth-supported telecolposcopy for cervical cancer programs in low-resource settings.,9742557,R21TW011223,"['Acetic Acids ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Colposcopy ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Midwife ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Peru ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' Measures ', ' Rural Community ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' Colposcopes ', ' colpospectroscope ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Cervical ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' Visual ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Remote Consultation ', ' programs ', ' Distant ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' Modality ', ' Bypass ', ' reproductive ', ' Early identification ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Premalignant ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Province ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Science ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Preventive screening ', ' Preventative screening ', ' cost ', ' fight against ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' screening ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' Patient Triage ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' Peruvian ', ' remote communities ', ' early screening ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",FIC,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,263308,0.22697092927146553
"Comparative Modeling to Inform Cervical Cancer Control Policies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite successful cervical cancer screening in the United States, over 12,000 women develop and 4,000 women die from cervical cancer each year. New technologies, including screening tests and vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually-transmitted virus known to cause cervical cancer, represent tremendous opportunities for innovative and efficient cervical cancer programs in the U.S. but also pose significant challenges for decision making, due to the complex and long natural history of disease and the different time points along the disease spectrum at which interventions are applied. Consequently, policy makers are uniquely reliant on mathematical modeling to provide evidence on the optimal cervical cancer control strategies. These models can be used to integrate the most up-to-date data, extrapolate current short- term findings into long-term outcomes, and evaluate what-if scenarios that would otherwise be impractical or infeasible to conduct in clinical studies. There has been a growing number of independent mathematical models that have been developed to address clinical and policy questions with respect to cervical cancer prevention and control but no formal efforts to compare assumptions and results across models. As part of the CISNET consortium, a group of established cervical cancer modelers from the U.S., Australia, and the Netherlands will engage in a formal collaboration of comparative modeling using a series of state-of-the-art mathematical models of HPV and cervical carcinogenesis. We will pursue analyses related to the historical impact of screening, the comparative effectiveness of current and anticipated HPV vaccination and screening strategies, and optimal routes for reducing cervical cancer disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies, including screening tests and vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually- transmitted virus known to cause cervical cancer, are dramatically changing the landscape of cervical cancer prevention in the U.S. and worldwide. In order to address important evidence gaps in cervical cancer control, we have assembled five independent research teams who have been at the frontier of modeling cervical cancer prevention over the last decade to engage in formal comparative modeling, evaluate the comparative and cost-effectiveness of screening and vaccination strategies, and disseminate results to inform health policies and decision.",Comparative Modeling to Inform Cervical Cancer Control Policies,9762590,U01CA199334,"['Australia ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cytology ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Kenya ', ' mortality ', ' Netherlands ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' South Africa ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Uganda ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Woman ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' uptake ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' Country ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' disease natural history ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' CISNET ', ' Vaccinated ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' vaccination strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' comparative ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' comparative cost effectiveness ', ' clinical development ', ' sexually transmitted virus ', ' ']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,U01,2019,1273285,0.2797120041390384
"Georgia CTSA Research Supplement to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research (Hernandez) Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Taylor, W. Robert Project Summary/Abstract This diversity supplement builds upon the work of the Georgia Clinical and Translational Science Alliance (Georgia CTSA) (ULTR002378) parent grant by conducting translational research and better engaging rural and underserved Georgia Latinas in cervical cancer prevention, and participation in cancer clinical research. Latina women are disproportionately impacted by cervical cancer in comparison to women from other racial/ethnic groups. In the state of Georgia, this national trend remains as Latinas are disproportionately affected by higher rates of cervical cancer diagnoses compared to non-Latina black and white women. Although studies have identified facilitators to cervical cancer prevention among Latinas, they are narrow in scope and don't address Latinas residing in rural areas and the boarder contextual factors that may prohibit women from participating in prevention and clinical research. Using community engaged approaches applied through a minority stress framework, the objective of this research proposal is to identify and improve our understanding of the facilitators and barriers to cervical cancer prevention, and participation in cancer clinical research among rural Mexican immigrant Latinas in Georgia. Using a mixed-methods approach, the specific aims include: Aim 1a: To identify the facilitators and barriers of cervical cancer prevention methods among rural Latina women in Georgia; Aim1b: To investigate the role of promotoras (community health workers) and other community-based, cancer prevention opportunities and outreach strategies to decrease cervical cancer disparities; and Aim 2: To assess factors associated with Latina participation in clinical cervical cancer research. Hypothesis: Immigrant related minority stress factors will significantly decrease the likelihood of preventive behaviors, and participation in clinical research among rural Latina immigrants. This study is significant because Latina women simultaneously experience the greatest burden of cervical cancer health disparities and are the fastest growing major demographic in the U.S, thus this growth may exacerbate the burden of cervical cancer. The research is innovative because it: (1) focuses on a largely rural, underserved, vulnerable population with unique and specific needs; (2) uses the Minority Stress Model that has not being applied in cancer research; and (3) engages the community as a part of the interdisciplinary team. Research findings will be used to inform to inform community and system-level approaches to address a persistent disparity.

"Web App Technology for Boys and Parents: Improving HPV Vaccine Uptake The President's Cancer Advisory Board and the Centers for Disease Control have called for renewed efforts in promoting vaccination for Human Papillomavirus (HPV), including vaccination for adolescent boys, because the uptake of this new vaccine remains alarmingly low. Currently, less than 15% of adolescent boys have received the HPV vaccine; thus, most of this population remains at risk for oropharyngeal, anal, and penile cancers. Many parents remain unconvinced of the safety and effectiveness of HPV vaccines, so effective and accessible messaging to improve decision-making on this vaccine is needed. Parents of adolescent boys also have different concerns about HPV vaccination than for adolescent girls, creating a need for unique health communication interventions to promote vaccine uptake among boys. Interventions also need to address the unique challenges of minority populations and populations for whom English is not the first language. A novel digital intervention will be produced and evaluated for its ability to improve HPV vaccine outcomes. Specifically, a mobile responsive web application (“mobile web app”) will be created that performs similar to a mobile app but runs on a variety of computing platforms from personal desktop and laptop computers to the latest smart phones and tablet computers. Mobile web app content will be targeted to parents and adolescent boys aged 11-13 years living in New Mexico, a majority-minority population with large proportions of Hispanics, Whites, and Native Americans. The specific aims are to: 1) carefully and systematically develop a mobile web app (BoyVac) for smart phones, tablet computers, and personal computers that will utilize Diffusion of Innovations principles to provide targeted information concerning HPV vaccine adoption to adolescent males and their parents, particularly minority adolescents and parents; 2) implement a comprehensive and rigorous test of the impact of the BoyVac mobile web app intervention on HPV vaccine adoption outcomes via a randomized efficacy trial (BoyVac v. usual and customary care); and 3) examine the dose-response relationships between mobile web app usage and vaccine outcomes within a components analysis. A group-randomized pretest-posttest controlled design will be implemented, recruiting 1800 pairs of parents and adolescent boys from 30 pediatric clinics (n=60 parents and boys per clinic) affiliated with the Envision New Mexico, a best practices program at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center's Department of Pediatrics. Parents will be surveyed at baseline, a 3-month follow-up, and a 9-month follow-up and records HPV vaccination adoption for the boys will be obtained from the clinics' medical records at the 9- month follow-up. Analyses will test the hypotheses that 1) more 11-13 year old boys in the intervention group (BoyVac mobile web app) will adopt the HPV vaccine than boys in the usual and customary care comparison group and 2) adoption of HPV vaccine will be mediated by improvements in theoretical mediators among parents in the intervention compared to the usual and customary care comparison group. The uptake of vaccines for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in the U.S. is far below recommended levels, particularly for adolescent boys and especially among minority families. Proposed here is a mobile web application (“mobile web app”) for personal computers, smart phones, and tablet computers that will accurately inform parents and adolescent boys about the HPV vaccination and address unique concerns about its safety and effectiveness for boys. The BoyVac mobile web app will be evaluated for its ability to improve vaccine outcomes in a randomized efficacy trial with parents and adolescent boys aged 11-13 years who obtain care in pediatric

"Epidemiologic Impact of HPV Vaccination Project Summary Introduction of prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines has the potential to dramatically decrease morbidity and mortality from anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. However, data from vaccine clinical trials cannot predict vaccine effectiveness in “real-world” community settings, and introduction of a 9-valent (in addition to a 2- and 4-valent) vaccine in 2015 and reduced dosing schedules (from 3 to 2 doses) in 2016 could further modify vaccine effectiveness. The impact of vaccine introduction can be efficiently and accurately evaluated by HPV surveillance studies that assess vaccine effectiveness, herd protection, cross-protection (decrease in HPV types genetically related to vaccine types), and type replacement (increase in non-vaccine- type HPV due to a reduction in vaccine types). We previously conducted 4 HPV surveillance studies in women (2006-2017) and 2 in men (2013-2017). Among women, we found evidence for vaccine effectiveness (but lower effectiveness with 1 vs. 3 doses), herd protection, and cross-protection; no evidence for type- replacement; and an unexpected increase in non-vaccine-type HPV in unvaccinated women. Among men, we found preliminary evidence for vaccine effectiveness and herd protection. Continued investigation through the proposed renewal is essential to achieve the following objectives: 1) assess the effects of 9-valent vaccine introduction and reduced dosing schedules on effectiveness, 2) elucidate long-term trends in herd protection, 3) identify signals of diminished cross-protection or emerging type-replacement, and 4) determine mechanisms for increases in non-vaccine-type HPV in unvaccinated women. The specific aims are to: 1) determine long- term trends in 4-valent - and emerging trends in 9-valent - HPV prevalence among vaccinated women (2006- 2023) and men (2013-2023) to assess HPV vaccine effectiveness, and among unvaccinated women and men to assess herd protection; 2) assess the differential impact of the number of vaccine doses received on vaccine-type HPV, by age; 3) determine trends in non-vaccine-type HPV prevalence among vaccinated women and men, to examine for persistent cross-protection and emerging type replacement; and 3) explore biological and behavioral mechanisms for the increase in non-vaccine-type HPV in unvaccinated women. Our approach will be to enroll 1,600 women and men in two additional surveillance studies, to characterize the impact of vaccine introduction across a total of 6 time periods in women (2006-2023, N=2,400) and 4 in men (2013- 2023, N=1,600). The proposed research is innovative because the resulting data could shift current research and clinical practice paradigms in the areas of vaccination and virology, and the research plan utilizes novel concepts, approaches and new methodologies to explore mechanisms driving HPV trends. The proposed research is significant because the data will provide key evidence for: 1) vaccination and cervical cancer screening programs; 2) public health communications and risk-reduction counseling; and 3) cost-effectiveness analysis and policy decisions: these will help to reduce disparities and mortality due to HPV-related cancers. Narrative In this study, we will characterize the epidemiologic impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine introduction from 2006 to 2023, among diverse populations of young women and men in a community. The study will provide a comprehensive assessment of the post-marketing impact of HPV vaccine introduction, including 9- valent HPV vaccine introduction and reduced dosing schedules, and will provide key evidence for HPV vaccine recommendations, cervical cancer screening programs, public health messaging, cost-effectiveness analysis, and policy decisions that aim to reduce rates of cervical cancer and other HPV-associated cancers.

"Randomized controlled trial of an implementation science tool to increase cervical cancer screening in Mombasa, Kenya ABSTRACT Summary of Proposal: This proposal supports a 4-year research and training program to allow Dr. Eastment to make substantial progress toward a career as an independent investigator and leader in the field of women’s health and cervical cancer screening implementation. She aims to quantify the cervical cancer screening care cascade and understand the correlates of appropriate screening. She will then conduct a cluster randomized trial to test an implementation science tool, the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA), to improve cervical cancer screening for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women in Mombasa, Kenya. A budget impact analysis of SAIA will be performed for Mombasa County Department of Health (DOH). Dr. Eastment’s expertise in coordinating studies in Kenya utilizing the same implementation science tool provides a strong foundation for this proposed plan. Her training program will include further instruction in study design, economic evaluations, analysis of correlated data, and implementation science from leaders in these fields, leveraging on the outstanding research and training environments at the University of Washington (UW), and the strength of long- term collaborations with Mombasa County. Her collection of mentors from the UW Departments of Medicine, Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Global health, along with her collaborators from Mombasa County, are eager to mentor and support Dr. Eastment’s project and career development. Research Plan: Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women in sub-Saharan Africa, and the majority of cervical cancer mortality occur in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Many of the disparities between high and LMICs are attributed to differences in screening. Kenyan guidelines recommend screening with visual inspection methods followed by treatment of pre-cancerous lesions with cryotherapy and loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). Implementation of these are poor with only 14% of Kenyan women ever having been screened for cervical cancer as of 2014. To address this implementation gap, this application proposes three aims. In Aim 1, we will describe the cervical cancer screening care cascade, from identification of female clients age 21-65 years old, through referral for follow-up of clients with positive or suspicious screens, in family planning (FP) clinics in Mombasa County. Following characterization of this cascade, we will conduct an analysis of correlates of failure to screen for cervical cancer in FP clients seen over a one-year period in Mombasa County. Aim 2 will test whether SAIA increases cervical cancer screening compared to usual procedures in a cluster randomized trial in 20 FP clinics in Mombasa County. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the cost and budget impact of using SAIA to increase cervical cancer screening in FP clinics in Mombasa County. The results of this study have the potential to improve cervical cancer screening, and inform policy in the Mombasa DOH for a fiscally responsible evidenced-based approach for cervical cancer screening. The long-term goal is to decrease cervical cancer mortality and improve women’s health. NARRATIVE McKenna Eastment, MD, MPH is a Senior Fellow/Acting Instructor in the Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the Department of Medicine at the University of Washington. This K08 award, with the career development plan and research proposal, aims to provide Dr. Eastment with mentorship in conducting a clinical trial testing an implementation science tool to improve cervical cancer screening for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women in Mombasa, Kenya. These research findings have the potential for generalizability throughout Kenya and to other low and middle-income countries to decrease cervical cancer mortality by increasing screening and improving linkage to treatment of pre-cancerous lesions.","Randomized controlled trial of an implementation science tool to increase cervical cancer screening in Mombasa, Kenya",9741101,K08CA228761,"['Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Budgets ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' career transition ', ' career advancement ', ' Career Mobility ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Therapeutic Cold ', ' Cryotherapy ', ' Cold Therapy ', ' Cytology ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Kenya ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Framing HPV Vaccination Messages for African American Parents PROJECT SUMMARY The 2014 President’s Cancer Panel called underuse of HPV vaccines “a serious, but correctable threat to progress against cancer.” The Cancer Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel, more recently, identified expanding the use of HPV vaccines as a top priority for cancer prevention, especially in medically underserved populations. The overarching goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel, theory-based message framing intervention to accelerate HPV vaccine uptake among African American adolescents. Based on prospect theory and the health belief model, this project aims to 1) develop culturally appropriate messages framed in gains and losses and pretest these messages through community engagement; 2) determine whether/how the effects of message framing (gain vs. loss) on African American parents’ acceptance of the HPV vaccine are moderated by their prior beliefs about HPV and the HPV vaccine; and 3) evaluate the efficacy of a message framing intervention rooted in message targeting principles utilizing mobile tablets for efficient targeting through a clinic-based randomized trial. The proposed project will generate key insights into the persuasive effects of message framing as applied to the promotion of HPV vaccination. It will produce solid empirical evidence surrounding a novel, theory-based message framing intervention aimed at accelerating HPV vaccine uptake among African American adolescents. Addressing a critical aspect of health disparities disadvantaging the African American community, this research represents a systematic and timely effort to respond to the call of the 2014 President’s Cancer Panel on the urgency of optimizing communication strategies for promoting HPV vaccination among key stakeholders. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project addresses a major public health concern – low HPV vaccination rates among adolescents – and represents a timely effort to develop effective communication interventions for promoting HPV vaccination. By examining HPV vaccination communication strategies that resonate with African American parents, the proposed project also addresses critical health disparities in HPV-related cancers. With its focus on developing and evaluating a theory-based message framing intervention, the proposed project will not only advance communication science bearing direct relevance to public health promotion, particularly the promotion of HPV vaccination, but also make a significant step forward toward translating basic behavioral science underlying vaccine communication into community-based interventions.",Framing HPV Vaccination Messages for African American Parents,9647431,R01CA219060,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Attitude ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Belief ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exercise ', ' family medicine ', ' Family Practice ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Interview ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Woman ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' Solid ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' uptake ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' HPV infection ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' age group ', ' novel ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', "" President's Cancer Panel "", ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' Basic Behavioral Science ', ' 12 year old ', ' twelve years of age ', ' twelve year old ', ' age 12 years ', ' 12 years of age ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' chronic infection ', ' persistent infection ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,421212,0.14594476763234612
"Implementing Cancer Prevention Using Patient - Provider Clinical Decision Support ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of U.S. adults and adolescents do not receive key evidence-based preventive care services. Rural populations are especially disadvantaged with multiple healthcare disparities, resulting in lower rates of primary and secondary cancer prevention interventions. The objective of this project is to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a sophisticated Web-based, electronic health record (EHR)-linked clinical decision support (CDS) system designed to improve primary and secondary cancer preventive care. To achieve this objective, we link EHR data to evidence-based cancer prevention algorithms in a secure Web site to: (a) identify at the point of care all eligible patients not up o date on their cancer prevention interventions; and (b) present to both patient and primary care provider (PCP) and/or a key member of the primary care team, certified medical assistant (CMA), appropriate evidence-based primary cancer prevention interventions and cancer screening options at the point of care. The Cancer Prevention-CDS will focus on breast cancer screening in women aged 50-74, colorectal cancer screening for both sexes aged 50-75, cervical cancer screening for women aged 21-65, human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination for both sexes aged 11-26, and referrals for weight management and smoking cessation in all adults aged 18 and older. Effectiveness is assessed by cluster-randomizing 30 primary care clinics with roughly 285 PCPs and 153,000 study-eligible patients into one of three experimental conditions: Group 1: PCP-focused CDS intervention in which the PCP triggers use of the CDS system and engages patients in appropriate cancer prevention strategies. Group 2: CMA-focused CDS intervention in which the CMA triggers use of the CDS system and interacts with the patient to engage them in appropriate cancer prevention strategies before seeing their PCP, who will approve or discuss the plan with their patient. Group 3 clinics provide usual care with no intervention-related activity related to cancer prevention. With 10 clinics, 95 PCPs, and 51,000 potentially eligible patients per study arm, this study will formally test the hypothesis tht Groups 1 and 2 are superior to Group 3 over an 18-month follow-up period with respect to: (a) significantly higher rates of appropriate screening for breast, cervix, and colorectal cancer, as defined by the United States Preventive Services Task Force; and (b) significantly higher rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in males and females aged 11-26 years. We further posit that Groups 1 and 2 will have higher short-term health care costs but better long-term cost-effectiveness than Group 3. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and RE-AIM conceptual frameworks will be used to guide implementation planning, organization, conduct, and impact evaluation of the intervention in a large rural healthcare system. This project will engage a rural population with substantial healthcare disparities and gaps in the receipt of primary and secondary cancer prevention. Results will advance dissemination and implementation research methods that can reduce health disparities and improve healthcare for millions in medically underserved areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If primary and secondary prevention practices for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer were improved, more than 100,000 cancer deaths a year could be delayed or averted in the United States and the burden of these diseases on quality of life reduced. In this project, we will adapt, implement, and evaluate a proven electronic health record-linked, Web-based, personalized clinical decision support system to identify patients needing primary and/or secondary cancer prevention care. The objectives of this project are to improve the quality and consistency of primary and secondary prevention of common cancers in rural areas by providing patient- centered and evidence-based treatment recommendations to both primary care provider teams and patients at the point of care and provide an efficient and effective model for implementation and dissemination of cancer prevention in rural settings.",Implementing Cancer Prevention Using Patient -

Our primary focus has been to improve early detection and prevention of diseases that disproportionately affect communities, disenfranchised from the formal healthcare system. Towards this end, we have tested the effectiveness of multiple Community Health Worker (CHW)-led interventions to improve screening uptake for four priority health conditions: HIV, Hepatitis C, Colorectal Cancer (CRC), and cervical cancer. However, a major limitation of all such projects is that each has existed as distinct, standalone initiative targeting a specific community and/or individuals who meet narrow eligibility criteria. The current proposal will address this gap. We propose to develop and implement a clinical trial that offers screening for all four health conditions in a no-clinical setting, circumventing known structural and access barriers to care. Our partners in this application are our longstanding collaborators: the Health Choice Network- a consortium of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and the Center for Haitian Studies. Based on their input, we propose a pragmatic trial of 900 people ages 50-65 who self-identify as Hispanic, Haitian, and/or African and have not been appropriately screened for the aforementioned diseases of interest. Our specific aim is to determine whether a CHW led intervention, which provides innovative, home based screening increases uptake among medically underserved individuals who are in need of at least of these tests. This multi-modality approach will use oral swabs for HIV, finger stick testing for Hepatitis C, Fecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT) for CRC, and self- sampling for Human Papilloma Virus, the primary cause of cervical cancer. The proposed pragmatic trial, grounded in the tenets of community-based participatory research (CBPR), will help identify optimal strategies for delivering prevention services to medically-vulnerable population sub-groups. Our study testing innovative, cost sensitive approaches will help inform health reform strategies that increasingly prioritize population health and precision medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minority groups suffer disproportionately from conditions such as HIV, Hepatitis C, colorectal and cervical cancer. Strategies that can increase rates of screening for these conditions can help narrow such disparities. We propose a study in which community health workers use recent advances in home testing technology to see if having these screenings services done at home leads to more screenings than simply referring persons to more traditional medical care.",Increasing Uptake of Evidence Based Screening Services though a CHW-led multi-modality program: The South Florida Center for Reducing Health

"Sex-based differences in oral HPV infections and outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY - Sex-based differences in oral HPV infections and outcomes Many infectious diseases exhibit differential severity between the sexes yet the mechanisms driving such innate biases are incompletely understood. The prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) oral infections and HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers are 3- to 5-fold more common in men than women. This correlates only partially (~18%) with behavioral risk factors which would indicate that males have higher HPV exposure. Other possible explanations include increased susceptibility to infection on a cellular level or decreased ability to clear infections. Papillomavirus (PV) infections are predominantly confined to keratinocytes, which are the only permissive cells in the epithelium. We are poised to determine whether male-derived keratinocytes and/or tissues have increased inherent susceptibility to PV infections and, in the process, we expect to identify cell factors that are differentially regulated in keratinocytes making them more susceptible to infection versus keratinocytes more resistant to infection. During the initial stages of an HPV or animal PV infection, the host keratinocytes possess a number of intrinsic (restriction) factors that can inhibit the establishment of infection. Additionally, innate immune signaling in keratinocytes determines whether innate effector cells are recruited and whether an effective adaptive immune response ensues. These keratinocyte-specific activities are likely to have a role in determining whether a PV infection will become persistent or will be cleared. Persistent HPV infections are more likely to progress to cancers. Clinical and epidemiological studies indicate a role for sex hormones in HPV pathology of the female genital tract; however, it is unclear whether the influence of sex hormones is due to increased HPV infection, increased viral persistence, or differential immunological regulation. In this application, we focus on the role of the host keratinocyte in the initial control of PV infection. Our decades of ground-work in studying molecular mechanisms controlling PV infections will permit us to determine whether/how sex-based differences impact the keratinocyte response to PV infection. In Aim 1 we will use a novel PV infection assay to quantitatively determine the susceptibility of human oral keratinocytes from male and female donors to HPV16 infection. In Aim 2 we will assess the susceptibility of male and female BALB/c FoxN1nu/nu mice to MmuPV1 infection and tumor formation. Five males and five females will be used to determine if the sexes differ in onset and extent of tumor formation. For each aim, we will assay infections and viral gene expression levels and correlate these with the expression of viral restriction factors and immune modulators in infected cells. We expect this pilot work to yield data foundational for a follow-up studies aimed to define more mechanistically the explanations for sex-based disparities in oncogenic HPV infections of the oral cavity.

"Tri-City Cervical Cancer Prevention Study among Women in the Justice System ABSTRACT  Women with criminal justice histories persist as one of the groups most affected by cervical cancer, with 4- 5 times the rates of cancer compared to other women. Our research team has spent the last 8 years investigating the factors that account for this disparity. We have found that abnormal Pap tests are high, with sexual health risk, trauma, women's life circumstances, and low cervical health literacy as facilitators of risk and barriers to care. But questions remain about justice-involved women's screening trajectories over time given complex cervical screening recommendations and the difficulty of interfacing with health systems and navigating complex health insurance environments. Thus, there is insufficient information available to inform interventions that address justice-involved women's cervical cancer prevention needs in the community.  The specific objective of this study is to develop a better understanding of the natural history of cervical cancer risk and prevention behaviors among community-based justice-involved women. The long-term goal of this study is to identify strategies for where and how to intervene to change the factors and environments that structure women's cervical health risk.  We have a unique opportunity to conduct a natural history study of cervical health risk and screening among community-based justice-involved women in three geographically and demographically diverse cities. We plan to leverage three existing samples of community-based, justice-involved women – in Kansas City, MO, Birmingham, AL, and Oakland, CA – to become one of the first long-term cancer prevention studies of high-risk women across cities in the U.S. By studying three geographically and demographically diverse cities, we can draw conclusions about factors at each level of inquiry across study sites, accounting for variation in cities and increasing our ability to generalize findings. By leveraging samples generated by our ongoing projects in each city, we also offer a cost-effective and feasible way to engage in long-term follow-up of hard to reach women, with whom we've already established trust and rapport.  In our first aim, we use the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations (BMVP) to explain the natural history of cervical health risk behaviors, screening, and treatment among community-based justice-involved women (N~600) over a 5-year period in three cities. In the second aim, we use a mixed methods approach to unpack the ways in which significant domains of the BMVP operate in the daily lives of a subsample of women (N~60) recruited from the larger sample.  Public health significance of this study centers on two products: 1) Development of a multi-level conceptual framework that explains the environment in which justice-involved women engage in cervical cancer prevention. 2) Creation of intervention models that address “upstream” determinants of health in clinical and service settings, while addressing justice-involved women's unique needs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study is significant because it capitalizes on a rare opportunity to study cervical cancer risk and prevention behaviors among community-based justice-involved women in three distinct cities, factoring in sociodemographic differences of women, unique policy, and service environments, which will inform subsequent intervention design, implementation, and impact in multiple contexts, increasing generalizability and reach of interventions to justice-involved women in U.S. cities. The natural history design will allow us to trace women's real-life cervical health trajectories, as women navigate the complex recommendations for cancer prevention in the tumultuous reality of their post-incarceration lives, providing a detailed picture of where women fail and where systems fail women when it comes to cervical cancer prevention.",Tri-City Cervical Cancer Prevention Study among Women in the Justice System,9656413,R01CA226838,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cities ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communities ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Housing ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Justice ', ' Kansas ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' Cervical ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' probation ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Jail ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' longterm followup ', ' long-term followup ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Clinical Services ', ' health literacy ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' screening ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' recruit ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' Service setting ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' screening guidelines ', ' screening recommendations ', ' recommended screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,630955,0.18965135323365306
"A Secondary Analysis to Identify HPV Vaccination Disparities across Hispanic Subgroups in the United States PROJECT SUMMARY: Hispanics are the largest racial/ethnic minority population in the United States (US) and experience several disparities related to human papillomavirus (HPV), including Hispanic women having the highest cervical cancer incidence rate of any racial/ethnic group in the country. HPV vaccine is recommended for adolescents and young adults in the US, and estimates of HPV vaccine coverage among Hispanic adolescents vary, though recent national data suggest that vaccine coverage is similar to or slightly higher than other racial/ethnic groups. However, a key and recurring limitation of existing HPV vaccine research is that Hispanics have been aggregated and examined as a single, homogeneous group in analyses. Hispanics are in fact a heterogeneous population, with the term “Hispanic” referring to persons of Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Central American, South American, or other Spanish descent. There are striking differences between these Hispanic subgroups on immigration histories, demographics, and health behaviors and outcomes, and aggregating them in past HPV vaccine research has likely masked important subgroup differences. Unmasking and accounting for these subgroup disparities is an important component of planning health promotion programs for Hispanics (e.g., HPV vaccine interventions and surveillance efforts). Our long-term goal is to understand how HPV vaccination outcomes differ across Hispanic subgroups and then apply this understanding to increase vaccine coverage. The proposed study will take the first step in achieving this goal by analyzing existing data from the 2012-2016 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) to identify existing HPV vaccination disparities across Hispanic subgroups. The NIS-Teen is considered the gold standard of US vaccination data, and analyses will include a large, national sample of Hispanic adolescents (n=16,381) and be well-powered to identify subgroup disparities. The proposed study will determine how Hispanic subgroups differ in terms of current HPV vaccine coverage among adolescents (Aim 1), multi-level correlates of HPV vaccine coverage (Aim 2), potential barriers to parents vaccinating their children against HPV (Aim 3), and the validity of parent-reported HPV vaccination data (Aim 4). Each study aim will address a unique research question and together will provide a novel and comprehensive understanding of how HPV vaccination outcomes differ across Hispanic subgroups. We anticipate that Hispanic subgroup differences will be identified within each study aim. The resulting subgroup-specific data will greatly impact both the development (i.e., current HPV vaccine coverage, correlates, and barriers) and evaluation (i.e., validity of parent-reported data) of HPV vaccine interventions and surveillance efforts for Hispanics. PROJECT NARRATIVE: A key and recurring limitation of existing HPV vaccine research is that Hispanics have been aggregated and examined as a single, homogeneous group in analyses, an approach that has likely masked disparities between Hispanic subgroups.

"Community-based Participatory Design of an HPV rapid diagnostic test for cervical cancer screening in South Florida PROJECT SUMMARY: Natalia Rodriguez, PhD, MPH, Research Assistant Professor at the University of Miami (UM), is a biomedical engineer and global health researcher whose overarching career goal is to develop and improve upon mechanisms for successful uptake and systemic adoption of innovative cancer detection technologies through human-centered and community-based participatory design, in order to empower community health workforces, strengthen health systems, and improve health outcomes at the population level. There is a pressing and unmet need for an inexpensive HPV rapid diagnostic test (RDT) that is designed with the end-user in mind and amenable to rapid systemic adoption in any given context. The research Dr. Rodriguez proposes entitled, Community-based Participatory Design of a Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Rapid Diagnostic Test for Cervical Cancer Screening in South Florida, combines community-based participatory research (CBPR) methodology and human-centered design with health technology development to inform the design and translation of a rapid, point-of-care HPV molecular diagnostic test for community use in cervical cancer screening.  Dr. Rodriguez‘s previous work in technology development, specifically a molecular diagnostic platform for point-of-care testing of HPV, in combination with her current work in health systems and community health worker (CHW) training have prepared her to conduct the proposed research. Dr. Rodriguez proposes training activities that include didactic and experiential learning on: 1) Qualitative research study design and CBPR methodology; 2) Stakeholder engagement and human-centered design principles; 3) Implementation science and translational research; 4) Designing and conducting randomized control trials. The proposed career development plan will build upon her previous training to enhance her trajectory towards an independent investigator in public health and translational sciences.  An outstanding multidisciplinary mentorship team will guide Dr. Rodriguez through the proposed research and training goals: Dr. Kobetz has expertise in CBPR, cancer disparities research and clinical trials, Dr. Daunert in molecular diagnostic development, and Dr. Knaul in health systems and policy, stakeholder engagement, and CHW training. The proposed research and career development plan utilize the breadth of resources at UM including the Clinical and Translational Science Institute, the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the laboratory and prototyping facilities and equipment of the Biomedical Nanotechnology Institute at UM (BioNIUM) and UM’s Miller School of Medicine.  The strong mentors, collaborators, and resources at UM ensure the success of the proposed research. This award will provide Dr. Rodriguez with the training and preliminary data needed to be successful in a future R01 study to validate the HPV RDT and will facilitate her development into an independent investigator and leader in translational research on cancer diagnostic tools for medically-underserved communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing cervical cancer screening methods are unsuitable for low-resource settings that lack the required infrastructure, equipment, and trained personnel, and do not consider the persistent sociocultural access barriers that exacerbate cancer disparities in the U.S. There is a pressing and unmet need for an HPV rapid diagnostic test (RDT) that is designed with real consideration of the end-user and community, social structure, and cultural context, in order to address specific needs, increase cervical cancer screening coverage, and ensure linkage to follow-up care. The objective of this proposal is to employ community-based participatory research methods to adapt a rapid HPV test prototype, tailor it to user- and stakeholder-informed target technical specifications to suit the needs of medically-underserved communities in South Florida, and train local CHWs to use it for community-based cervical cancer screening.",Community-based Participatory

"Multi-level Optimization of the Cervical Cancer Screening Process in Diverse Settings & Populations (METRICS) ABSTRACT For more than 5 decades, the US has sought to lower cervical cancer deaths through screening; however, disparities remain. Introduction of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV)-based tests and HPV vaccines have expanded cervical cancer prevention strategies and changed screening and management guidelines. As technology, guidelines, and policies change, our MultilEvel OpTimization of the CeRvIcal Cancer Screening Process in Diverse Settings & Populations (METRICS) PROSPR II Research Center will elucidate multilevel factors that hamper or facilitate the cervical cancer screening process and reduce disparities in vulnerable populations. METRICS unites three PROSPR I Research Centers with demonstrated capability to provide validated data for a combined cohort of ~1.2 million screened and unscreened women. Our community settings represent 3 care delivery models—safety-net system, managed care system, and primary care provider networks in Texas, Washington, and Massachusetts. We will collect, harmonize, and document > 10 years of high-quality, comprehensive cervical cancer screening process data at the patient, provider, clinic, and system levels using a rich array of electronic clinical information systems and novel data sources. Our combined cohort is socioeconomically and geographically diverse and includes vulnerable groups such as HIV-infected and uninsured women. Our three interconnected observational projects are designed to understand how cervical cancer screening is delivered across our spectrum of delivery models, and how to optimize the screening process to reduce disparities. Innovative geospatial and Bayesian statistical methods in Project 1 will better elucidate at what levels variation in screening process occurs. Project 2 will investigate how multilevel programs and policies influence adherence to guidelines for average-risk women. Project 3 will inform precision screening for women with altered risk. Based on our observational findings, in years 4-5, we will design and implement pilot interventions leveraging IT-enabled tools to address key failures in the screening process and reduce disparities. Our transdisciplinary team has epidemiologists, primary and specialty care physicians, and intervention, implementation, and healthcare delivery experts. We are poised to efficiently evaluate the full cervical cancer screening process and provide expertise, leadership, and resources for cross-organ PROSPR II collaborations. Our cores and research projects will achieve our goals of advancing understanding of screening as practiced in community settings through: (1) analysis of multilevel observational data from our heterogeneous settings with diverse populations, (2) development and testing of impactful interventions to optimize the screening process, and (3) application of our novel observational projects and quality metrics to the cancer screening processes for other organs. Based on our successful experience leading and collaborating in PROSPR I, we thoughtfully organized our four cores to be able to launch research activities and contribute to trans-PROSPR II activities quickly and effectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE The METRICS PROSPR II Research Center will study delivery of cervical cancer screening and treatment in three diverse U.S. community healthcare systems. Recently, guidelines for screening and treatment have become more complex with introduction of new tests and prevention methods (HPV vaccine). We will examine how programs and policies influence the care that women receive, the ideal personalized screening strategy for women with lower or higher cancer risk (such as HIV+), and the impact of pilot interventions to improve care, with a focus on reducing disparities.",Multi-level Optimization of the Cervical Cancer Screening Process in Diverse Settings & Populations

"Increasing Uptake of Evidence Based Screening Services though a CHW-led multi-modality program: The South Florida Center for Reducing Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Miami's South Florida Center for Reducing Health Disparities (SUCCESS) aims to improve the health of South Florida's most vulnerable populations through collaborative, participatory research. Our primary focus has been to improve early detection and prevention of diseases that disproportionately affect communities, disenfranchised from the formal healthcare system. Towards this end, we have tested the effectiveness of multiple Community Health Worker (CHW)-led interventions to improve screening uptake for four priority health conditions: HIV, Hepatitis C, Colorectal Cancer (CRC), and cervical cancer. However, a major limitation of all such projects is that each has existed as distinct, standalone initiative targeting a specific community and/or individuals who meet narrow eligibility criteria. The current proposal will address this gap. We propose to develop and implement a clinical trial that offers screening for all four health conditions in a no-clinical setting, circumventing known structural and access barriers to care. Our partners in this application are our longstanding collaborators: the Health Choice Network- a consortium of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and the Center for Haitian Studies. Based on their input, we propose a pragmatic trial of 900 people ages 50-65 who self-identify as Hispanic, Haitian, and/or African and have not been appropriately screened for the aforementioned diseases of interest. Our specific aim is to determine whether a CHW led intervention, which provides innovative, home based screening increases uptake among medically underserved individuals who are in need of at least of these tests. This multi-modality approach will use oral swabs for HIV, finger stick testing for Hepatitis C, Fecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT) for CRC, and self- sampling for Human Papilloma Virus, the primary cause of cervical cancer. The proposed pragmatic trial, grounded in the tenets of community-based participatory research (CBPR), will help identify optimal strategies for delivering prevention services to medically-vulnerable population sub-groups. Our study testing innovative, cost sensitive approaches will help inform health reform strategies that increasingly prioritize population health and precision medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minority groups suffer disproportionately from conditions such as HIV, Hepatitis C, colorectal and cervical cancer. Strategies that can increase rates of screening for these conditions can help narrow such disparities. We propose a study in which community health workers use recent advances in home testing technology to see if having these screenings services done at home leads to more screenings than simply referring persons to more traditional medical care.",Increasing Uptake of Evidence Based Screening Services though a CHW-led multi-modality program: The South Florida Center for Reducing Health

"Social Determinants of HPV Vaccine Completion among Adolescents ABSTRACT The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. and is responsible for causing 70 to 90 percent of all genital, anal, and oral cancers. Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by these outcomes. Vaccination during adolescence is recommended before sexual activity to prevent HPV and associated cancers. However, national adolescent vaccine rates remain low with completion rates lower than initiation rates, especially among minority youth. Recently, the number of doses required for vaccine completion among some age groups has been reduced. For example, only two doses are now required for vaccine completion for adolescents ages 11 to 14, while adolescents ages 15 to 17 remain on the three-dose series. Despite these changes, the HPV vaccine series remains on a 6- month administration schedule for completion. The gap between vaccine initiation and completion rates and disparities in HPV vaccination may be influenced by social determinants. To date, the majority of studies have explored individual-level determinants to refusing or starting the HPV vaccine series. Much less is known regarding determinants of vaccine completion, especially relationship and community level factors. The purpose of this study is to identify individual-, relationship-, and community-level determinants of HPV vaccine completion among adolescents ages 11 to 14 and barriers and facilitators to completion among parents and adolescents. More specifically we aim to: 1) Determine the effects of social determinants of health for adolescent HPV vaccine completion (age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance type, area deprivation index for residence, and distance to clinic) within a 14-month period using EHR data from retrospective chart reviews; and 2) Explore barriers and facilitators to vaccine completion by describing parent and adolescent experiences with the HPV vaccine, including individual, relationship, and community level determinants influencing vaccine completion, and integrating interview data with social determinants explored in Aim 1. A parallel mixed-methods design will be used to integrate information from electronic health records (EHR) with qualitative data from individual interviews with parents and adolescents to determine social determinants influencing vaccine completion. A modified version of the Social Ecological Model will be used as a guide to understand various determinants affecting HPV vaccine completion across three levels: Individual, relationship, and community. Thirty-two adolescents and parents will be recruited from a local pediatric clinic. Quantitative data will be analyzed using logistic regressions and directed content analysis will be used to analyze interview data. Results from both analyses will be presented using data displays where an integrative summary will provide further description of how determinants serve as barriers and facilitators to vaccine completion. Findings from this study will guide future research on multi-level intervention studies that prioritize social determinants of HPV vaccination completion to reduce barriers experienced among parents and adolescents. PROJECT NARRATIVE The HPV vaccine helps prevent HPV infections and related cancers when all doses of the vaccine are received; however, many teenagers are not getting all the doses. This study seeks to provide a comprehensive description on why teenagers and parents do not complete the HPV vaccine. Findings from this study will help inform interventions that can increase vaccine completion rates among teenagers to reduce their risk of developing cancers in the future.",Social Determinants of HPV

"Mixed-Methods approach to evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of HPV+ women who have performed self-collection 7. Project summary/abstract PROJECT: Mixed-Methods approach to evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of HPV+ women who have performed self-collection Cervical cancer is a serious public health problem reflecting social and gender inequalities in health. It is the third cause of cancer death among women in the world, with more than 85% of cases occurring in developing countries. Currently, the development of new technologies based on HPV DNA detection allows HPV self- collection, increasing screening coverage. In a self-collection based strategy, triage becomes a key step in the prevention process, as it is the first method to identify HPV+ women who will need diagnostic and treatment procedures. However, high adherence to triage is difficult to obtain, which is not surprising given that adherence to follow-up and treatment is a generalized problem in cervical cancer programs. Specific aims of the study are: 1. To evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage among women with HPV+ self-collected tests compared to usual care. 2. To evaluate the implementation strategy and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the multi-component mHealth intervention. The research study design will follow the structure of an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I trial, and will use mix-method approach. A cluster randomized trial including 200 CHWs (clusters) and 4000 women will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to cytology triage at 120 days after positive HPV testing. The mHealth intervention will include SMS messages sent to HPV+ women to inform them when results are available, and subsequent SMS messages as reminders. In addition, for those HPV+ women who did not had a triage cytology result within 60 days of the HPV test result, CHWs will receive an e-mail and SMS message so they can contact these women during home visits for specific counseling and support. For the implementation evaluation, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will be used to guide qualitative data collection and analysis of factors that influence implementation. RE-AIM will be used to assess the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance of the Intervention. Results of this project will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention to increase triage of HPV+ women, but it could be adapted to increase compliance of diagnoses/ treatment of cervical cancer and other health problems. Findings from the implementation evaluation will be highly applicable to programs that use or are planning to incorporate HPV self-collection in different settings and countries. In addition, the use of CFIR and RE-AIM in this innovative study will serve as a model of work, constituting an important advance in the use of Implementation Science in the Region. 8. Project Narrative This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a of a multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage among women with HPV+ self-collected tests. In addition it will evaluate the implementation using two key frameworks: The RE-AIM and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).

"A Randomized Controlled Trial of Mail-Self Stamped HPV Testing to Increase Cervical Cancer Screening Participation Among Minority/Underserved Women in an Integrated Safety Net Healthcare System PROJECT SUMMARY The implementation of clinic-based Papanicolaou (Pap) test screening for cervical cancer has dramatically reduced the incidence of this disease in the US and other countries with widespread screening programs. However, many women remain at high risk for cervical cancer due to their inability or unwillingness to periodically attend for clinic-based screening. At present, evidence-based, client-directed strategies such as patient reminders and recalls, patient education, and patient navigation are the basis for many behavioral interventions to increase screening participation. However, these strategies alone are often unable to resolve many of the barriers faced by screening non-attendees. Using mailed self-sampling kits to test for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes cervical cancer, may overcome multiple barriers to clinic-based screening. However, this mailed self-sampling has not been evaluated in safety net health systems in the US that provide care for a large portion of socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals. We hypothesize that in the context of a safety net health system, pairing mailed self-sample HPV testing with patient navigation, an outreach intervention with strong evidence among underserved minority populations, will have a synergistic effect for increasing screening participation among underscreened women. We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of three outreach interventions to increase primary screening participation and clinical follow-up among underscreened women ages 30-65 years in a safety net health system. The trial setting is Harris Health System, the third largest publicly-funded safety net health system in the nation, which serves a predominantly racially/ethnically minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged population. The three study arms are: 1) telephone recall (control); 2) telephone recall with mailed self-sample HPV testing kits (intervention); and 3) telephone recall with mailed self- sample HPV testing kits and patient navigation (intervention plus). The primary outcome is primary screening participation. Secondary outcomes are predictors of screening and attendance for clinical follow-up among screen-positive women. Our study will also identify attitudes and experiences toward self-sampling among women who receive a mailed self-sampling kit and toward clinical follow-up among women who test positive for high-risk HPV. Finally, our study will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mailed self-sample HPV testing, alone and in combination with patient navigation, to increase screening participation and reduce cervical cancer risk in safety net health systems. Collectively, these data will define the impact of self-sample HPV testing in a real- world health system setting, a critical step toward the development of scalable, cost-effective programs to eliminate cervical cancer disparities among underserved racial/ethnic minority women. Narrative Regularly attending for Pap test cervical cancer screening in a clinic is often unfeasible and/or unacceptable to many women. Using a randomized controlled trial, this study will evaluate if mailing and testing self-sampled kits for high-risk HPV can cost-effectively increase screening participation among underserved minority women in a safety-net health system. It will also evaluate programmatic strategies to optimize participation in home- based screening.",A Randomized Controlled Trial of Mail-Self Stamped HPV Testing to Increase Cervical Cancer Screening Participation Among Minority/Underserved Women in an Integrated Safety Net Healthcare System,9684982,R01MD013715,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Attitude ', ' Australia ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Canada ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Client ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Europe ', ' Future ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccines ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Woman ', ' World Health ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' Generations ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' integrated healthcare systems ', ' integrated health system ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Prevent infection ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' HPV-High Risk ', ' High risk Human papilloma virus ', ' High risk Human Papillomavirus ', ' High risk HPV ', ' High Risk Oncogenic HPV ', ' cost ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' arm ', ' three-arm study ', ' screening ', ' cervicovaginal ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' underserved minority ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' cost-effectiveness evaluation ', ' evaluate cost-effectiveness ', ' screening program ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' screening participation ', ' ']",NIMHD,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,512059,0.24292536940283133
"Developing a tool to measure cervical cancer stigma among HIV+ women in Kenya Cervical cancer is an AIDS-defining malignancy, and there is clear evidence that HIV increases the risk of infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and development of pre-cancer and cancer. Further, there is a global disparity in HIV and cervical cancer burden, with the greatest incidence and mortality for both diseases in low- and middle-income countries. The poor outcomes related to both cervical cancer and HIV are preventable with access to and uptake of quality healthcare. As HIV care has become more widely available, researchers and program planners have recognized the importance of interventions to address stigma. Negative social perceptions and stigma about HIV have led to reluctance to test or access treatment in some populations; however, little is known about the presence and potential impact of cervical cancer-related stigma, particularly among HIV-positive women. Uptake of cervical cancer screening and prevention services depends on a convergence of service availability, personal perception of risk and willingness to seek services, all of which may be significantly affected by disease-related stigma. Further, as more programs adopt HPV testing as their method of cervical cancer screening, there may be an additional layer of stigma related to diagnosis with a sexually transmitted disease. A better understanding of whether and how HIV-related stigma intersects and possibly amplifies HPV and cervical cancer stigma and willingness to seek services would guide the development of stigma reduction interventions that could improve screening and follow-up rates. To facilitate this understanding, we propose to use intersectional theory to develop and validate measures for stigma related to HPV and cervical cancer among HIV-infected women. We will carry out in-depth interviews with HIV- positive women, HIV-negative women and providers in Kisumu, Kenya to develop a framework for understanding the individual and intersectional HPV, cervical cancer and HIV-related stigmas. Using data from these interviews, we will develop context-specific measures of HPV, cervical cancer and intersectional stigmas of HPV, cervical cancer and HIV. We will then pilot and validate the instrument using rigorous survey development methods. Finally, we will administer the finalized survey among HIV-positive women enrolled in care at the Family AIDS and Education Services Program in Kisumu, Kenya to evaluate the relationship between stigma related to HPV and cervical cancer among HIV-positive women and engagement in care. Insight into the interplay between individual and intersectional stigmas and willingness to seek services will help us inform future interventions to increase the reach and impact of cervical cancer screening among HIV- positive women. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women living with HIV have a greater risk of developing cervical cancer, and comprehensive HIV-care should include cervical cancer screening, particularly in low- and middle income countries where services are otherwise limited. The impact of HPV and cervical cancer-related stigma among HIV positive population has not been well studied. In order to better understand the interdependent relationship between HIV stigma and HPV or cervical cancer-related stigma, we propose to apply intersectional theory to the development and validation of stigma measures that will ultimately guide interventions to improve cervical cancer prevention and treatment services among HIV-positive women.",Developing a tool to measure cervical cancer stigma among HIV+ women in Kenya,9753601,R21TW011061,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Human Development ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Kenya ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychometrics ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Shame ', ' Social Perception ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United Nations ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' uptake ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Structure ', ' prevention service ', ' Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' risk perception ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' sexual trauma ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' screening ', ' sexual HIV transmission ', ' AIDS education ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' intersectionality ', ' treatment services ', ' service programs ', ' early screening ', ' Infrastructure ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",FIC,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,185376,0.2446568925292323
"Improving Uptake of Cervical Cancer Prevention Services in Appalachia PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL The goal of this Program Project is to address the burden of cervical cancer incidence and mortality in Appalachia through the delivery of a clinic-based integrated prevention program that focuses on the major causes of cervical cancer (tobacco smoking, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and lack of cervical cancer screening) designed to target individual, social and community, health system and broader contextual-level barriers related to the burden of cervical cancer. Building upon our long history of collaborative research and community partnerships, the Program will test the effectiveness of health system-based interventions focused on tobacco use, HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening (Pap test and/or self-testing with follow-up of positive tests), as part of an integrated clinic-based cervical cancer prevention program. The multi-level interventions (directed to three levels of influence – clinic, provider and patient) will be offered to eligible female patients and age-eligible children and young adults in four Appalachian states (Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia). Our research process is guided by a socio-ecological model based on the Social Determinants of Health, the Proctor Model for Implementation Science and a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) framework. The aims of this Program Project are to: 1) Test the effectiveness of an integrated cervical cancer prevention program, consisting of three established interventions, designed to address three causes of cervical cancer in a region with one of the highest cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in the United States; and 2) Evaluate the impact of the cervical cancer prevention program, including implementation, and acceptability, with attention to both short- and long-term impact and sustainability at the clinics. Four cores – Intervention and Consortium, Survey and Data Collection, Biostatistics and Evaluation, and Administrative – will facilitate the smooth and integrated operation of all projects. Integration and interaction of the projects in this Program is evident in several ways: 1) all projects focus on one health disparity; 2) participants will be recruited from the same health systems; 3) a core set of measures is being used by all projects; 4) all projects include transdisciplinary teams; 5) all projects build upon and extend findings from our long history of collaborative research and community partnerships; 6) all projects focus on multi-level assessment and/or interventions using the Warnecke model as a framework and utilize the Proctor et al. Implementation Science Framework; 7) all projects involve interaction with the community in some way, thus enhancing the CBPR nature of the Program; and 8) evaluation will assess implementation, service and client outcomes at the project and overall Program levels including: cost, satisfaction, effectiveness, sustainability, and safety, to name a few outcomes. If successful, this Program Project will provide evidence for a novel and innovative approach to address disparities in underserved communities with plans for sustainability and dissemination, as well as cost-effectiveness data.

"Overcoming barriers to cancer screening among women living in rural and segregated communities PROJECT SUMMARY In 2018, 4,170 women will die from cervical cancer and 23,240 will die from colorectal cancer, yet many of these deaths avoidable through cancer screening. Cancer mortality rates and screening prevalence vary by geography, with women living in rural and racially-segregated areas more likely to die from, but less likely to screen for, these cancers compared to women in other areas. Women in rural and segregated areas face unique multilevel barriers to screening (e.g., low cancer risk perceptions, high travel burden). Home-based self- collection of human papillomavirus (HPV) tests for cervical cancer and fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) for colorectal cancer, paired with culturally-appropriate educational materials, could overcome these barriers. However, the successful implementation of such interventions in rural and segregated communities is understudied. The proposed study will use health behavior theory and intervention design and adaptation techniques to clarify person- and environment-level factors related to cancer screening among women in rural and segregated areas. In the proposed K22 project, the principal investigator (PI) and collaborators will conduct mixed methods formative research (including analysis of spatial data, in-depth interviews, surveys, and focus groups) to examine environment- and person-level correlates of cancer screening among women (ages 50-65 years) in rural, segregated areas (Aim 1). Using those findings, the team will adapt existing, evidence-based cancer screening educational materials, which will be delivered to eligible women in rural, segregated communities in conjunction with self-collected HPV tests and FIT (Aim 2). The team will examine feasibility and preliminary outcomes data for this pilot study to support an R01-level randomized hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of the intervention materials to improve cancer screening in these underserved and understudied communities. In addition to these research activities, the proposed K22 project includes several training activities to support the career development of the PI, Dr. Jennifer L. Moss. Dr. Moss’s long-term career goal is to become a scientific leader in transdisciplinary research on geographic disparities in cancer prevention behaviors and outcomes. Her short-term career goals include obtaining additional training in mixed methods analysis, intervention design, and grant writing. With protected time for research and further training, Dr. Moss can use the proposed K22 project to launch a career as an independent behavioral scientist contributing to the National Cancer Institute’s mission to reduce the burden of cancer in the population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening can reduce cancer mortality rates, including for cervical and colorectal cancers, but screening is lower and mortality is higher among people living in rural and segregated areas compared to people living elsewhere. The public health implications of the proposed project include the identification of novel, multilevel determinants of cancer screening among women in vulnerable areas using techniques from geospatial analysis, mixed methods, and intervention development and adaptation. Long-term, the findings from this project have the potential to reduce geographic disparities in cancer screening and burden and to lower overall rates of cancer in the population.",Overcoming barriers to cancer screening among women living in rural and segregated communities,9663403,K22CA225705,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hybrids ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' County ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' falls ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Research Activity ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Mosses ', ' Bryophyte ', ' Bryophyta ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' cancer risk ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' risk perception ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Collection ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' implementation trial ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' evidence base ', ' screening ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' rurality ', ' recruit ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' ']",NCI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,K22,2019,194944,0.03476396430196752
"Precision methylation biomarkers linked to cancer disparities Project Summary No woman should die of cervical cancer, yet cervical cancer is the third leading malignancy among women in the world, after breast cancer and colorectal cancer. Cervical cancer is also one of the tumors in which the most glaring disparities exist worldwide. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality has been higher for decades among Latinas in the United States (US). However, a recently published study revealed that cervical cancer death rates among White and Black women in the US are much higher than previously thought, after adjusting for the number of hysterectomies performed. Black women are dying from cervical cancer at a rate 77% higher than previously thought, and white women are dying at a rate 47% higher. The disparity in cervical cancer mortality rates by race doubled, from 2.7 to 5.4 per 100,000 women, after removing women with hysterectomies from mortality calculations. Presumably, the same is the case for Latina women, but there is currently no data available to verify if this is the case. The use of cytology screening (Pap smear) and oncogenic Human papilloma Virus (HPV+) genotyping are effective in identifying women who may be at risk for cervical cancer, but cannot be used to predict who is more likely to develop cervical carcinoma. Current standard of practice in the US for women with persistent HPV+ infection and abnormal Pap is referral to colposcopy and subsequent biopsy. However, most of these biopsies (55%-70%) are performed in women without clinical disease The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility for the commercialization of the CervicalMethDx Test, a precision methylation for the cervical cancer screening space. We will focus on patients with persistent oncogenic Human Papilloma Virus (HPV+) infection, who are referred into colposcopy and subsequent biopsy, even when most will have a normal biopsy. We are partnering with David Sidransky's research laboratory to optimize the CervicalMethDx Test and with the Education and Outreach Department of the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center to introduce precision epigenetic services to residents of low-income neighborhoods in Baltimore. Efficient triage of HPV+ women into colposcopy will decrease unnecessary biopsies, improve health care quality, decrease health care costs, and reduce existing cervical cancer mortality disparities in the US.

Triage into colposcopy will decrease unnecessary biopsies and improve health care quality, particularly among low-income Latina and African American women who have a higher burden of cervical cancer in the United States. !",Precision methylation biomarkers linked to cancer disparities,9905229,R44MD014911,"['Genomics ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Validation ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' HPV-High Risk ', ' High risk Human papilloma virus ', ' High risk Human Papillomavirus ', ' High risk HPV ', ' High Risk Oncogenic HPV ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Oncogenic ', ' commercialization ', ' tumor ', ' arm ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' methylation biomarker ', ' methylation marker ', ' Innovation Corps ', ' I-Corps ', ' biomarker development ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' Latin American ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' Acetic Acids ', ' Africa ', ' Baltimore ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Colposcopy ', ' Communities ', ' Cytology ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Hysterectomy ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Publishing ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Reflex ', ' Reflex action ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' United States ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' bisulfite ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Blinded ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Uterine Cervix Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Cervix Uteri Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Cervix Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasms ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Visual ', ' Glare ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Cervix carcinoma ', ' Uterine Cervix Carcinoma ', ' Cervix Uteri Carcinoma ', ' Cervical Carcinoma ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Squamous intraepithelial lesion ', ' Squamous Cell Intraepithelial Neoplasia ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' HPV infection ', ' instrument ', ' Hour ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' Participant ', ' validation studies ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' ']",NIMHD,"LIFEGENE-BIOMARKS, INC.",R44,2019,192563,0.2384311466628714
"Cervical, Anal & Oral HPV Persistence/Adolescent Girls The period from adolescence to emerging adulthood is characterized by multiple developmental transitions and peak incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Hispanic and African-American women are at high risk for HPV-associated and other sexually transmitted diseases, including cervical cancer and Chlamydia. Subsequent to the approval and release of the quadrivalent (Gardasil) HPV vaccine in 2007, we initiated a prospective cohort study of sexually-active, inner-city, minority women (aged 12-19) attending the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center (MSAHC), the largest comprehensive adolescent primary care facility in the U.S. We observed higher rates of HPV infection and associated cervical cytological abnormalities post-vaccination among subjects immunized at age 15 or older who took ≥12 months (vs. <12 months) to complete the 3-dose vaccine schedule. Furthermore, we found evidence for increased risk of cervical infection with HPV vaccine types and other STIs among subjects with a history of exposure to psycho-social risk indicators reflecting family disadvantage, psychological distress, and history of childhood abuse/neglect. Last year, the FDA approved a new 9-valent HPV vaccine with a reduced dosing schedule for younger adolescents based on evidence from short term bridging studies of primarily Caucasian and low-risk women with limited numbers of sexual partners. This study will assess the real-world effectiveness of the new vaccine in a high-risk minority population. This unique study cohort also provides opportunities to explore new and innovative areas of research relevant to adolescent health in women, especially with respect to other STIs, and the cervicovaginal microbiome. This is of particular relevance since STI rates are high in this population, with a third acquiring Chlamydia. In addition, we observed that certain types of bacteria found in the cervical specimens from women in our study were associated with increased risks of Chlamydia and HPV infection. Furthermore we hypothesize that the impact of chronic stress and risky behaviors leading to STIs and breakthrough HPV infections may be influenced in part by changes in the cervicovaginal microbiome. To address these health disparities in minority young women, we are proposing to expand our existing cohort and recruit an additional 1108 women with prospective follow-up to age 30 to: 1) determine whether there is a reduction in the incidence of cervical, anal and oral HPV infection and incidence of cervical cytological abnormalities among 9-valent versus quadrivalent HPV vaccinees; 2) study the association between cervicovaginal microbiome and risk of HPV and STIs; and 3) assess the complex associations between psycho-social factors including history of childhood abuse/neglect and risk of HPV and STIs. Data obtained from this study will be essential to understanding the long-term impacts of HPV vaccination in high-risk, minority women not studied in the vaccine trials, and will provide the biological underpinnings for future screening practices, as well as estimating the potential impact of the cervicovaginal microbiome and psycho-social factors on risk of HPV and STIs. Minority youth have the highest rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including chlamydia and human papillomavirus (HPV). This study investigates the continued burden of HPV and other STIs in a population of predominantly Hispanic and African-American inner-city adolescent and young adult women. The study will also estimate the potential impact of the vaginal microbial environment, and behavioral and social factors, on the risks of HPV and STIs. Data from this study will be essential to understanding the long-term impacts of HPV vaccination and the biological underpinnings for future screening practices.","Cervical, Anal & Oral HPV Persistence/Adolescent Girls",9644486,R01AI072204,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Bacteria ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Childhood Abuse ', ' Child Abuse ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Rickettsia trachomae ', ' C. trachomatis ', ' C trachomatis ', ' Chlamydia trachomatis ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Cytology ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunization ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Schedule ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Cervical ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' sexually active ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Exposure to ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' HPV infection ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' psychosocial ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' high risk behavior ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' abuse neglect ', ' neglect and abuse ', ' psychological distress ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Vaccinated ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' HPV-High Risk ', ' High risk Human papilloma virus ', ' High risk Human Papillomavirus ', ' High risk HPV ', ' High Risk Oncogenic HPV ', ' Gardasil ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 15 year old ', ' fifteen years of age ', ' fifteen year old ', ' age 15 years ', ' 15 years of age ', ' novel vaccines ', ' next generation vaccines ', ' new vaccines ', ' high risk ', ' FDA approved ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adulthood ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' screening ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' vaccine trial ', ' vaccine study ', ' vaccination trial ', ' vaccination study ', ' adolescent health ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' Immunize ', ' recruit ', ' early screening ', ' cervicovaginal microbiome ', ' ']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,914592,0.2134338138225169

"EdTech-HPV: A Community Approach using Education and Technology to Increase HPV Vaccination 1 Project Summary  2 Despite the significant advantages of preventing Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the growing  3 evidence that shows the benefits of the HPV vaccine, vaccine uptake among eligible girls and boys (i.e., 9-17  4 year olds) in the U.S. has been suboptimal. Current efforts have increased vaccination rates marginally, but  5 remain low and far from the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80%. In 2013, only 37% of eligible adolescent girls  6 received the full 3 doses of the vaccine and only 15% of boys. Persistent HPV infection precedes HPV driven  7 cancers by years, in some cases decades, but if current levels of HPV driven cancer cases continue, the  8 vaccine has the potential to prevent over 25,000 cases yearly among current adolescents in the U.S. Hispanic  9 girls and boys in the U.S. have similar vaccination rates, though adult Hispanics exhibit greater HPV driven 10 cancer disparities, supporting an even stronger case to create tailored interventions to increase the vaccination 11 rates in this growing population. The most common barriers cited by Latino parents for vaccinating their 12 children are lack of knowledge about the vaccine or HPV in general and lack of provider recommendation, but 13 if recommended, most “will certainly get the vaccine for their child.” Our research has yielded a 78% 14 vaccination completion rate as compared to 17%. This pilot study is the impetus of the current proposal, to 15 conduct a larger, definitive randomized trial for the effectiveness of the EdTech-HPV (Community Approach 16 using Education and Technology to Increase HPV Vaccination) intervention among Latinos. Project goals are: 17 1: To conduct a randomized controlled trial for the effectiveness of a community-based HPV vaccination 18 program that targets Mexican-American parents of HPV vaccine eligible children. 2: To develop a multi-level 19 statistical predictive model on vaccination series completion. This intervention is based on evidence supporting 20 community based programs to increase immunizations, particularly among immigrant parents of eligible 21 children. The Mexican population in the U.S. is the largest and fastest growing Latino population. For over 10 22 years the Ventanilla de Salud (VDS) at Mexican consulates in the U.S has promoted the health of their 23 nationals and provided extensive assistance in disease prevention matters, within a safe and culturally 24 appropriate environment. Four VDS locations across the country will participate in this project (New York City, 25 Las Vegas, El Paso and Chicago) providing access to a diverse Mexican population living in dissimilar 26 environments. Parents in the study will participate in a structured, one-on-one educational session addressing 27 all aspects of HPV. A subsample will be randomly assigned to receive text messaging reminders to initiate 28 vaccination and to obtain the second and third doses. All subjects will be assessed, through provider 29 verification, for initiating their child's vaccine at completion of the doses. Achieving the aims of this project will 30 cement a replicable, community based model to reduce health disparities in the broader Latino population. Project Narrative This project seeks to provide a solution to the low rates of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among Latino children by working with and within a well established community programs that serves Latinos in the New York City area.

"Improving Uptake of Cervical Cancer Prevention Services in Appalachia PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL The goal of this Program Project is to address the burden of cervical cancer incidence and mortality in Appalachia through the delivery of a clinic-based integrated prevention program that focuses on the major causes of cervical cancer (tobacco smoking, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and lack of cervical cancer screening) designed to target individual, social and community, health system and broader contextual-level barriers related to the burden of cervical cancer. Building upon our long history of collaborative research and community partnerships, the Program will test the effectiveness of health system-based interventions focused on tobacco use, HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening (Pap test and/or self-testing with follow-up of positive tests), as part of an integrated clinic-based cervical cancer prevention program. The multi-level interventions (directed to three levels of influence – clinic, provider and patient) will be offered to eligible female patients and age-eligible children and young adults in four Appalachian states (Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia). Our research process is guided by a socio-ecological model based on the Social Determinants of Health, the Proctor Model for Implementation Science and a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) framework. The aims of this Program Project are to: 1) Test the effectiveness of an integrated cervical cancer prevention program, consisting of three established interventions, designed to address three causes of cervical cancer in a region with one of the highest cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in the United States; and 2) Evaluate the impact of the cervical cancer prevention program, including implementation, and acceptability, with attention to both short- and long-term impact and sustainability at the clinics. Four cores – Intervention and Consortium, Survey and Data Collection, Biostatistics and Evaluation, and Administrative – will facilitate the smooth and integrated operation of all projects. Integration and interaction of the projects in this Program is evident in several ways: 1) all projects focus on one health disparity; 2) participants will be recruited from the same health systems; 3) a core set of measures is being used by all projects; 4) all projects include transdisciplinary teams; 5) all projects build upon and extend findings from our long history of collaborative research and community partnerships; 6) all projects focus on multi-level assessment and/or interventions using the Warnecke model as a framework and utilize the Proctor et al. Implementation Science Framework; 7) all projects involve interaction with the community in some way, thus enhancing the CBPR nature of the Program; and 8) evaluation will assess implementation, service and client outcomes at the project and overall Program levels including: cost, satisfaction, effectiveness, sustainability, and safety, to name a few outcomes.

"Precision methylation biomarkers linked to cancer disparities Project Summary No woman should die of cervical cancer, yet cervical cancer is the third leading malignancy among women in the world, after breast cancer and colorectal cancer. Cervical cancer is also one of the tumors in which the most glaring disparities exist worldwide. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality has been higher for decades among Latinas in the United States (US). However, a recently published study revealed that cervical cancer death rates among White and Black women in the US are much higher than previously thought, after adjusting for the number of hysterectomies performed. Black women are dying from cervical cancer at a rate 77% higher than previously thought, and white women are dying at a rate 47% higher. The disparity in cervical cancer mortality rates by race doubled, from 2.7 to 5.4 per 100,000 women, after removing women with hysterectomies from mortality calculations. Presumably, the same is the case for Latina women, but there is currently no data available to verify if this is the case. The use of cytology screening (Pap smear) and oncogenic Human papilloma Virus (HPV+) genotyping are effective in identifying women who may be at risk for cervical cancer, but cannot be used to predict who is more likely to develop cervical carcinoma. Current standard of practice in the US for women with persistent HPV+ infection and abnormal Pap is referral to colposcopy and subsequent biopsy. However, most of these biopsies (55%-70%) are performed in women without clinical disease The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility for the commercialization of the CervicalMethDx Test, a precision methylation for the cervical cancer screening space. We will focus on patients with persistent oncogenic Human Papilloma Virus (HPV+) infection, who are referred into colposcopy and subsequent biopsy, even when most will have a normal biopsy. We are partnering with David Sidransky's research laboratory to optimize the CervicalMethDx Test and with the Education and Outreach Department of the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center to introduce precision epigenetic services to residents of low-income neighborhoods in Baltimore. Efficient triage of HPV+ women into colposcopy will decrease unnecessary biopsies, improve health care quality, decrease health care costs, and reduce existing cervical cancer mortality disparities in the US.

"An implementation science approach to address multi-level barriers to cancer screening among women living with HIV in South Africa ABSTRACT Over the next 20 years, cancer incidence and mortality are expected to rise at staggering rates worldwide, with much of the burden concentrated in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite widescale availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in LMICs, women living with HIV remain vulnerable to both AIDS- and non-AIDS defining cancers such as cervical and breast cancer. This is because screening coverage for breast and cervical cancer is low – and access to timely diagnosis and treatment is limited. In South Africa, for example, fewer than one-third of HIV-infected women undergo breast and cervical cancer screening at the recommended intervals. Attrition between cancer screening and treatment is also substantial among HIV-infected women in under- resourced South African settings. We seek to eliminate disparities in breast and cervical cancer outcomes among HIV-infected women in South Africa. In this application, we propose an innovative implementation science project to close the gap between cancer control policy and cancer screening practices in this high-risk population. Specific Aim 1 will use a sequential mixed-methods design consisting of focus groups, a discrete choice experiment (DCE), and in-depth interviews to study multi-level drivers of cancer screening and determine women’s preferences for cancer screening services. We will enroll 80 HIV-infected women and 32 men in 14 focus groups (8 participants in each group), 600 HIV-infected women in the DCE, and conduct 24 in- depth interviews with key stakeholders. In Specific Aim 2, we will co-create a multi-level intervention package with patients, providers, and policy makers, applying Design Thinking principles to design the package and assess its acceptability. We anticipate that the package will include training, clinical tools, and user-focused interventions applied at various levels of the Social Ecological Model to address the barriers identified in Aim 1. We will explore acceptability of the intervention package through user pre-testing workshops conducted with 6 user groups: 2 groups of HIV-infected women, 2 of healthcare providers, and 2 of policy makers. This project will provide robust preliminary data to inform larger-scale implementation trials to (1) promote uptake of cancer screening among women living with HIV and (2) improve retention in care for women who screen positive. We will leverage longstanding partnerships and a strong research infrastructure in Johannesburg to implement the proposed work. NARRATIVE Cervical cancer exacts an enormous toll on African women living with HIV who are at substantially increased risk for HPV infection, the necessary cause of cervical cancer. As these women age, the challenge of preventing and treating non-AIDS defining cancers such as breast cancer is rapidly evolving. This project will deepen our understanding of both the barriers to women’s cancer screening and the contextual factors that can support implementation of more effective public programs for breast and cervical cancer control among women living with HIV in South Africa.",An implementation science approach to address multi-level barriers to cancer screening among women living with HIV in South Africa,10072622,R21TW011715,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Sector ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' South Africa ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' African ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' cancer prevention ', ' tool ', ' HPV infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' care seeking ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' treatment program ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' chemotherapeutic agent ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' implementation trial ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' implementation science ', ' civil society ', ' screening ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' South African ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' preventable mortality ', ' preventable death ', ' breast and cervical cancer screening ', ' ']",FIC,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,181628,0.10721215090486341
"Community-based Participatory Design of an HPV rapid diagnostic test for cervical cancer screening in South Florida PROJECT SUMMARY: Natalia Rodriguez, PhD, MPH, Research Assistant Professor at the University of Miami (UM), is a biomedical engineer and global health researcher whose overarching career goal is to develop and improve upon mechanisms for successful uptake and systemic adoption of innovative cancer detection technologies through human-centered and community-based participatory design, in order to empower community health workforces, strengthen health systems, and improve health outcomes at the population level. There is a pressing and unmet need for an inexpensive HPV rapid diagnostic test (RDT) that is designed with the end-user in mind and amenable to rapid systemic adoption in any given context. The research Dr. Rodriguez proposes entitled, Community-based Participatory Design of a Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Rapid Diagnostic Test for Cervical Cancer Screening in South Florida, combines community-based participatory research (CBPR) methodology and human-centered design with health technology development to inform the design and translation of a rapid, point-of-care HPV molecular diagnostic test for community use in cervical cancer screening.  Dr. Rodriguez‘s previous work in technology development, specifically a molecular diagnostic platform for point-of-care testing of HPV, in combination with her current work in health systems and community health worker (CHW) training have prepared her to conduct the proposed research. Dr. Rodriguez proposes training activities that include didactic and experiential learning on: 1) Qualitative research study design and CBPR methodology; 2) Stakeholder engagement and human-centered design principles; 3) Implementation science and translational research; 4) Designing and conducting randomized control trials. The proposed career development plan will build upon her previous training to enhance her trajectory towards an independent investigator in public health and translational sciences.  An outstanding multidisciplinary mentorship team will guide Dr. Rodriguez through the proposed research and training goals: Dr. Kobetz has expertise in CBPR, cancer disparities research and clinical trials, Dr. Daunert in molecular diagnostic development, and Dr. Knaul in health systems and policy, stakeholder engagement, and CHW training. The proposed research and career development plan utilize the breadth of resources at UM including the Clinical and Translational Science Institute, the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the laboratory and prototyping facilities and equipment of the Biomedical Nanotechnology Institute at UM (BioNIUM) and UM’s Miller School of Medicine.  The strong mentors, collaborators, and resources at UM ensure the success of the proposed research. This award will provide Dr. Rodriguez with the training and preliminary data needed to be successful in a future R01 study to validate the HPV RDT and will facilitate her development into an independent investigator and leader in translational research on cancer diagnostic tools for medically-underserved communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing cervical cancer screening methods are unsuitable for low-resource settings that lack the required infrastructure, equipment, and trained personnel, and do not consider the persistent sociocultural access barriers that exacerbate cancer disparities in the U.S. There is a pressing and unmet need for an HPV rapid diagnostic test (RDT) that is designed with real consideration of the end-user and community, social structure, and cultural context, in order to address specific needs, increase cervical cancer screening coverage, and ensure linkage to follow-up care. The objective of this proposal is to employ community-based participatory research methods to adapt a rapid HPV test prototype, tailor it to user- and stakeholder-informed target technical specifications to suit the needs of medically-underserved communities in South Florida, and train local CHWs to use it for community-based cervical cancer screening.",Community-based Participatory

"Characterizing Disparities and Elucidating Opportunities Across the Cervical Cancer Continuum among Native American Women PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although cervical cancer is a preventable disease, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) women suffer from substantially lower cervical cancer screening rates, disproportionately higher cervical cancer incidence rates; and are more often diagnosed at distant stages of the disease than their non-Native counterparts. Despite progress in reducing the overall cervical cancer rate in the U.S., the higher (and increasing) incidence rate among AI/AN women, and the unfavorable profile of local versus advanced stage of disease at diagnosis, indicate a continued need for aggressive and comprehensive screening and timely follow-up of abnormal results. At a time when efficacious and well-known cervical cancer control interventions such as Pap screening, testing for human papillomavirus (HPV), and HPV vaccinations are widely available, these stark disparities across the cervical cancer continuum are alarming for AI/AN women and reflect a significant public health problem. This study will aim to fill in these critical gaps in knowledge, understanding, and translation by utilizing linked data for AI/AN women in the IHS Epi Data Mart with women in the highly unique New Mexico HPV Pap Registry (NMHPVPR) to characterize cervical cancer screening coverage, rates and intensity, failures in cervical cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment, and correlates of cervical screening with HPV vaccination among AI/AN women. Our aims are to use the linked dataset to: a) reduce any racial misclassification of AI/AN women in the NMHPVPR and characterize cervical cancer screening coverage, intensity, intervals, and annual screening rates and to identify disparities in screening among AI/AN women registered at IHS/Tribal/Urban (I/T/U) health care facilities in New Mexico; b) assess failures in follow-up to abnormal Pap/HPV tests, and treatment following a diagnosis of cervical precancer among New Mexican AI/AN women and to geospatially analyze the failures so as to guide targeted interventions in the areas of most need; and c) to estimate HPV vaccination coverage, vaccine dose delivery, and screening initiation by HPV vaccination status in AI/AN women attending I/T/U facilities. The overarching premise of this study is that comprehensive elucidation of the specific pathways through which failures occur among AI/AN women across the cervical cancer continuum will inform cost-effective and data-driven strategies for intervention that can mitigate the pervasive health disparities witnessed among this underserved population. Study findings will be translated into several peer-reviewed manuscripts and will be translated into reports and presentations to inform tribal leadership and I/T/U administrators/providers about key opportunities for improvement. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to link two existing datasets – the New Mexico Human Papilloma Virus Pap Registry and the Indian Health Service Epi Data Mart to: a) reduce any racial misclassification of AI/AN women in the NMHPVPR and characterize cervical cancer screening coverage, intensity, intervals, and annual screening rates and to identify disparities in screening among AI/AN women registered at IHS/Tribal/Urban (I/T/U) health care facilities in New Mexico; b) assess failures in follow-up to abnormal Pap/HPV tests, and treatment following a diagnosis of cervical precancer among New Mexican AI/AN women and to geospatially analyze the failures so as to guide targeted interventions in the areas of most need; and c) to estimate HPV vaccination coverage, vaccine dose delivery, and screening initiation by HPV vaccination status in AI/AN women attending I/T/U facilities.

In the United States (U.S.), CC ranks 14th in frequency. However, in certain populations and geographic areas of the U.S., CC incidence and death rates are significantly higher, due in part to racial and ethnic disparities in access, utilization, and quality of care, all of which contribute to worse health outcomes. Black women experience a disparate burden of CC incidence and mortality, having a higher risk of being diagnosed with and dying from CC than non-Hispanic White women. Appropriate and timely CC screening is a key factor in prevention. Leveraging the positive benefits of CC screening may reduce the CC disparate burden among Blacks. Research studies typically treat Blacks as a homogeneous group, despite differences within this population. To begin to address a gap in the literature within the scope of a career development award, this study focuses specifically on two subgroups of Black women - African Americans (AA) and Sub-Saharan African immigrants (SAI) given that there is paucity of research with SAI despite known cancer related disparities among SAI women. To promote screening for these underserved minority women, we will conduct research to better understand factors that influence engagement in cancer screening practices and willingness to conduct HPV self-sampling in which women self-collect samples for HPV testing using a swab, brush or lavage. Guided by the findings, we will develop and pilot test an innovative tailored intervention incorporating HPV self-sampling with peer-delivered education. The specific aims are to (1) examine general awareness and cultural factors related to cancer control and prevention among AA and SAIs; (2) examine the socioecological barriers and facilitators to CC screening with HPV self-sampling to tailor an evidenced based cervical health promotion program in these underserved subgroups; and (3) assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the intervention. The intervention, entitled Health is Wealth: A Cervical Health Program, will be pilot tested with 30 AA and 30 SAI women aged 30 to 65 years using a quasi-experimental design. These aims will also support the candidate’s career goal of developing an independent and extramurally funded program of research to promote cancer control and prevention for minority women. To further support this goal, a mentored career development plan consisting of training in mixed methods, adaptation and development of behavioral interventions, randomized clinical trial design, and research team management, is proposed. The rich research environment at the University of Kentucky and the expertise of the mentoring team will provide the supplemental resources and support needed for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed research and training plans. As such, this K01 award will provide the training, mentoring, and research experiences needed for the candidate to successfully compete for a R01-level CC screening intervention study and expedite her career development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the availability of screening tools that can prevent cervical cancer, Black women are burdened by high cervical cancer incidence and mortality.

"HPV ECHO: Increasing the adoption of evidence-based communication strategies for HPV vaccination in rural primary care practices ABSTRACT Despite the availability of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine that can prevent over 34,800 HPV-related cancers in the US every year, only 51% of girls and boys were up-to-date by 2018. Rural populations are the most impacted by HPV-related cancers. Best practices like the Announcement Approach training and systems communication have proven effective in increasing HPV vaccination, but rural providers struggle to access and implement such best practices. These data prompt the question: “How can academic centers support HPV vaccination in rural primary care practices?” Although never tested for HPV vaccination, the ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) Model is a promising implementation strategy (practice facilitation) that allows “experts” at academic centers to connect with primary care providers to discuss best practices in care and complex cases managed within local practices. The objective of this R01 is to test two ECHO-delivered HPV vaccination communication interventions in rural primary care clinics. The first will provide Announcement Approach training (HPV ECHO); the second will provide this approach plus systems strategies to communicate with parents who initially decline vaccination (HPV ECHO+). The rationale for the project is that ECHO is a robust, highly-accessible platform to deliver best practices to rural providers and address the context-specific communication needs of parents. Our long-term goal is to improve HPV vaccination rates in rural clinics and reduce the health inequity rural populations experience in cancer outcomes. Aim 1 is to evaluate the impact of HPV ECHO and HPV ECHO+ on HPV vaccination among adolescents. We will conduct a 3-arm cluster randomized trial with 36 primary care clinics in rural Pennsylvania. Clinics will be randomized to: HPV ECHO, HPV ECHO+, or control. Our primary outcome will be change in HPV vaccine initiation (≥1 doses) among adolescents, ages 11-14, at 12-month follow-up. Aim 2 is to evaluate the impact of HPV ECHO and HPV ECHO+ on implementation outcomes. Guided by implementation science frameworks, we will conduct a mixed-methods evaluation to compare interventions on acceptability, adoption, cost, penetration, and sustainability. Aim 3 is to evaluate the impact of interventions’ vaccine information on secondary acceptance of HPV vaccination at the clinic level. We will also follow a subset of 200 vaccine-declining parents for up to 12 months to assess exposure to and impact of vaccine information from study arms versus naturally-occurring sources (e.g., social media) on secondary acceptance. Our expected outcome is to demonstrate the effectiveness of a highly efficient and scalable implementation strategy, ECHO, to support HPV vaccination in rural clinics. This study is innovative in leveraging existing infrastructure at academic centers to deliver best practices for HPV vaccination where they are needed most and in developing a greater understanding of the influences on decision making among vaccine-declining parents. We expect the project to have a significant impact on HPV vaccine uptake as we address the communication needs of both rural providers and parents. Project narrative Our proposed research is to evaluate the effectiveness of using an existing implementation strategy infrastructure at academic centers in delivering best-practice communication interventions to increase HPV vaccination rates in rural primary care clinics. The project is relevant to public health because it aims to increase HPV vaccination rates and reduce cancer inequities in rural populations by addressing the context- specific communication needs of both rural providers and parents, especially those parents who are vaccine hesitant. The proposed research is relevant to the NCI because it aims to improve implementation of effective interventions that are responsive to behavioral and sociocultural factors in cancer prevention among rural populations, an understudied area in cancer prevention research.",HPV ECHO: Increasing the adoption of evidence-based communication strategies for HPV vaccination in rural primary care practices,10053611,R37CA253279,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Interview ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Parents ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Rural Population ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Rural Community ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' uptake ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Networks ', ' Exposure to ', ' HPV infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Scientist ', ' Notification ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HPV-Related Malignancy ', ' HPV-associated cancer ', ' HPV-associated malignancy ', ' HPV-related cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignancy ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-associated cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-associated malignancy ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-related cancer ', ' Human papillomavirus-Related Malignancy ', ' Human papillomavirus-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' human papillomavirus associated malignancy ', ' human papillomavirus-associated cancer ', ' human papillomavirus-related cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', "" President's Cancer Panel "", ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' 17 years of age ', ' age 17 years ', ' seventeen year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' 17 year old ', ' implementation science ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' arm ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' social media ', ' rural America ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' implementation strategy ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' Infrastructure ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' compare intervention ', ' comparison intervention ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NCI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R37,2020,383778,0.16203915801034266
"Community-based Participatory Design of a Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Rapid Diagnostic Test for Cervical Cancer Screening in South Florida PROJECT SUMMARY: Natalia Rodriguez, PhD, MPH, Assistant Professor of Public Health at Purdue University, is a biomedical engineer and global health researcher whose overarching career goal is to develop and improve upon mechanisms for successful uptake and systemic adoption of innovative cancer detection technologies through human-centered and community-based participatory design, in order to empower community health workforces, strengthen health systems, and improve health outcomes at the population level. There is a pressing and unmet need for an inexpensive HPV rapid diagnostic test (RDT) that is designed with the end-user in mind and amenable to rapid systemic adoption in any given context. The research Dr. Rodriguez proposes entitled, Community-based Participatory Design of a Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Rapid Diagnostic Test for Cervical Cancer Screening in South Florida, combines community-based participatory research (CBPR) methodology and human-centered design with health technology development to inform the design and translation of a rapid, point-of-care HPV molecular diagnostic test for community use in cervical cancer screening.  Dr. Rodriguez‘s previous work in technology development, specifically a molecular diagnostic platform for point-of-care testing of HPV, in combination with her current work in health systems and community health worker (CHW) training have prepared her to conduct the proposed research. Dr. Rodriguez proposes training activities that include didactic and experiential learning on: 1) Qualitative research study design and CBPR methodology; 2) Stakeholder engagement and human-centered design principles; 3) Implementation science and translational research; 4) Designing and conducting randomized control trials. The proposed career development plan will build upon her previous training to enhance her trajectory towards an independent investigator in public health and translational sciences.  An outstanding multidisciplinary mentorship team will guide Dr. Rodriguez through the proposed research and training goals: Dr. Kobetz has expertise in CBPR, cancer disparities research and clinical trials, Dr. Daunert in molecular diagnostic development, and Dr. Forman in epidemiology and anthropology. The proposed research and career development plan utilize the breadth of resources at Purdue including the Indiana Clinical and Translational Science Institute, the Purdue Cancer Center, and the biomedical innovation and translation resources of Discovery Park.  The strong mentors, collaborators, and resources at Purdue ensure the success of the proposed research. This award will provide Dr. Rodriguez with the training and preliminary data needed to be successful in a future R01 study to validate the HPV RDT and will facilitate her development into an independent investigator and leader in translational research on cancer diagnostic tools for medically-underserved communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing cervical cancer screening methods are unsuitable for low-resource settings that lack the required infrastructure, equipment, and trained personnel, and do not consider the persistent sociocultural access barriers that exacerbate cancer disparities in the U.S. There is a pressing and unmet need for an HPV rapid diagnostic test (RDT) that is designed with real consideration of the end-user and community, social structure, and cultural context, in order to address specific needs, increase cervical cancer screening coverage, and ensure linkage to follow-up care. The objective of this proposal is to employ community-based participatory research methods to adapt a rapid HPV test prototype, tailor it to user- and stakeholder-informed target technical specifications to suit the needs of medically-underserved communities in South Florida, and train local CHWs to use it for community-based cervical cancer screening. 9",Community-based Participatory Design of a Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Rapid Diagnostic Test for Cervical Cancer Screening in South Florida,10118419,K01CA241073,"['Adoption ', ' Anthropology ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Indiana ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Institutes ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Development Plans ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' point of care testing ', ' Bedside Testings ', ' tool ', ' success ', ' professor ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Testing ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' career development ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Diagnostics ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Purdue Cancer Center ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' implementation science ', ' prototype ', ' control trial ', ' equipment training ', ' molecular diagnostics ', ' Infrastructure ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,71824,0.17246861059175367
"Increasing Uptake of Evidence Based Screening Services though a CHW-led multi-modality program: The South Florida Center for Reducing Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Miami's South Florida Center for Reducing Health Disparities (SUCCESS) aims to improve the health of South Florida's most vulnerable populations through collaborative, participatory research. Our primary focus has been to improve early detection and prevention of diseases that disproportionately affect communities, disenfranchised from the formal healthcare system. Towards this end, we have tested the effectiveness of multiple Community Health Worker (CHW)-led interventions to improve screening uptake for four priority health conditions: HIV, Hepatitis C, Colorectal Cancer (CRC), and cervical cancer. However, a major limitation of all such projects is that each has existed as distinct, standalone initiative targeting a specific community and/or individuals who meet narrow eligibility criteria. The current proposal will address this gap. We propose to develop and implement a clinical trial that offers screening for all four health conditions in a no-clinical setting, circumventing known structural and access barriers to care. Our partners in this application are our longstanding collaborators: the Health Choice Network- a consortium of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and the Center for Haitian Studies. Based on their input, we propose a pragmatic trial of 900 people ages 50-65 who self-identify as Hispanic, Haitian, and/or African and have not been appropriately screened for the aforementioned diseases of interest. Our specific aim is to determine whether a CHW led intervention, which provides innovative, home based screening increases uptake among medically underserved individuals who are in need of at least of these tests. This multi-modality approach will use oral swabs for HIV, finger stick testing for Hepatitis C, Fecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT) for CRC, and self- sampling for Human Papilloma Virus, the primary cause of cervical cancer. The proposed pragmatic trial, grounded in the tenets of community-based participatory research (CBPR), will help identify optimal strategies for delivering prevention services to medically-vulnerable population sub-groups. Our study testing innovative, cost sensitive approaches will help inform health reform strategies that increasingly prioritize population health and precision medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minority groups suffer disproportionately from conditions such as HIV, Hepatitis C, colorectal and cervical cancer. Strategies that can increase rates of screening for these conditions can help narrow such disparities. We propose a study in which community health workers use recent advances in home testing technology to see if having these screenings services done at home leads to more screenings than simply referring persons to more traditional medical care.",Increasing Uptake of Evidence Based Screening Services though a CHW-led multi-modality program: The South Florida Center for Reducing Health

"Developing a tool to measure cervical cancer stigma among HIV+ women in Kenya Cervical cancer is an AIDS-defining malignancy, and there is clear evidence that HIV increases the risk of infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and development of pre-cancer and cancer. Further, there is a global disparity in HIV and cervical cancer burden, with the greatest incidence and mortality for both diseases in low- and middle-income countries. The poor outcomes related to both cervical cancer and HIV are preventable with access to and uptake of quality healthcare. As HIV care has become more widely available, researchers and program planners have recognized the importance of interventions to address stigma. Negative social perceptions and stigma about HIV have led to reluctance to test or access treatment in some populations; however, little is known about the presence and potential impact of cervical cancer-related stigma, particularly among HIV-positive women. Uptake of cervical cancer screening and prevention services depends on a convergence of service availability, personal perception of risk and willingness to seek services, all of which may be significantly affected by disease-related stigma. Further, as more programs adopt HPV testing as their method of cervical cancer screening, there may be an additional layer of stigma related to diagnosis with a sexually transmitted disease. A better understanding of whether and how HIV-related stigma intersects and possibly amplifies HPV and cervical cancer stigma and willingness to seek services would guide the development of stigma reduction interventions that could improve screening and follow-up rates. To facilitate this understanding, we propose to use intersectional theory to develop and validate measures for stigma related to HPV and cervical cancer among HIV-infected women. We will carry out in-depth interviews with HIV- positive women, HIV-negative women and providers in Kisumu, Kenya to develop a framework for understanding the individual and intersectional HPV, cervical cancer and HIV-related stigmas. Using data from these interviews, we will develop context-specific measures of HPV, cervical cancer and intersectional stigmas of HPV, cervical cancer and HIV. We will then pilot and validate the instrument using rigorous survey development methods. Finally, we will administer the finalized survey among HIV-positive women enrolled in care at the Family AIDS and Education Services Program in Kisumu, Kenya to evaluate the relationship between stigma related to HPV and cervical cancer among HIV-positive women and engagement in care. Insight into the interplay between individual and intersectional stigmas and willingness to seek services will help us inform future interventions to increase the reach and impact of cervical cancer screening among HIV- positive women. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women living with HIV have a greater risk of developing cervical cancer, and comprehensive HIV-care should include cervical cancer screening, particularly in low- and middle income countries where services are otherwise limited. The impact of HPV and cervical cancer-related stigma among HIV positive population has not been well studied. In order to better understand the interdependent relationship between HIV stigma and HPV or cervical cancer-related stigma, we propose to apply intersectional theory to the development and validation of stigma measures that will ultimately guide interventions to improve cervical cancer prevention and treatment services among HIV-positive women.",Developing a tool to measure cervical cancer stigma among HIV+ women in Kenya,9914142,R21TW011061,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Human Development ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Kenya ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychometrics ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Shame ', ' Social Perception ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United Nations ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' antiretroviral ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Structure ', ' prevention service ', ' Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' risk perception ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' sexual trauma ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' screening ', ' sexually transmitted HIV ', ' sexual HIV transmission ', ' AIDS education ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' treatment services ', ' service programs ', ' early screening ', ' Infrastructure ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",FIC,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,177789,0.2446568925292323
"A Randomized Controlled Trial of Mail-Self Stamped HPV Testing to Increase Cervical Cancer Screening Participation Among Minority/Underserved Women in an Integrated Safety Net Healthcare System PROJECT SUMMARY The implementation of clinic-based Papanicolaou (Pap) test screening for cervical cancer has dramatically reduced the incidence of this disease in the US and other countries with widespread screening programs. However, many women remain at high risk for cervical cancer due to their inability or unwillingness to periodically attend for clinic-based screening. At present, evidence-based, client-directed strategies such as patient reminders and recalls, patient education, and patient navigation are the basis for many behavioral interventions to increase screening participation. However, these strategies alone are often unable to resolve many of the barriers faced by screening non-attendees. Using mailed self-sampling kits to test for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes cervical cancer, may overcome multiple barriers to clinic-based screening. However, this mailed self-sampling has not been evaluated in safety net health systems in the US that provide care for a large portion of socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals. We hypothesize that in the context of a safety net health system, pairing mailed self-sample HPV testing with patient navigation, an outreach intervention with strong evidence among underserved minority populations, will have a synergistic effect for increasing screening participation among underscreened women. We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of three outreach interventions to increase primary screening participation and clinical follow-up among underscreened women ages 30-65 years in a safety net health system. The trial setting is Harris Health System, the third largest publicly-funded safety net health system in the nation, which serves a predominantly racially/ethnically minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged population. The three study arms are: 1) telephone recall (control); 2) telephone recall with mailed self-sample HPV testing kits (intervention); and 3) telephone recall with mailed self- sample HPV testing kits and patient navigation (intervention plus). The primary outcome is primary screening participation. Secondary outcomes are predictors of screening and attendance for clinical follow-up among screen-positive women. Our study will also identify attitudes and experiences toward self-sampling among women who receive a mailed self-sampling kit and toward clinical follow-up among women who test positive for high-risk HPV. Finally, our study will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mailed self-sample HPV testing, alone and in combination with patient navigation, to increase screening participation and reduce cervical cancer risk in safety net health systems. Collectively, these data will define the impact of self-sample HPV testing in a real- world health system setting, a critical step toward the development of scalable, cost-effective programs to eliminate cervical cancer disparities among underserved racial/ethnic minority women. Narrative Regularly attending for Pap test cervical cancer screening in a clinic is often unfeasible and/or unacceptable to many women. Using a randomized controlled trial, this study will evaluate if mailing and testing self-sampled kits for high-risk HPV can cost-effectively increase screening participation among underserved minority women in a safety-net health system. It will also evaluate programmatic strategies to optimize participation in home- based screening.",A Randomized Controlled Trial of Mail-Self Stamped HPV Testing to Increase Cervical Cancer Screening Participation Among Minority/Underserved Women in an Integrated Safety Net Healthcare System,9916806,R01MD013715,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Attitude ', ' Australia ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Canada ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Client ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Europe ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virus ', ' Woman ', ' World Health ', ' Pap smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Pap screening ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Generations ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' integrated health system ', ' integrated healthcare systems ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Characteristics ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' High Risk Oncogenic HPV ', ' High risk HPV ', ' High risk Human Papillomavirus ', ' High risk Human papilloma virus ', ' HPV-High Risk ', ' cost ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' arm ', ' 3-arm study ', ' three-arm study ', ' screening ', ' cervicovaginal ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' underserved minority ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' evaluate cost-effectiveness ', ' cost-effectiveness evaluation ', ' screening program ', ' annual screening ', ' routine screening ', ' screening participation ', ' ']",NIMHD,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,558334,0.24292536940283133
"Integrating social and molecular determinants of HPV-associated cancers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancer has been dramatically rising for the last few decades. The development and implementation of HPV vaccination and screening provide the promise of prevention. Primary prevention and advances in genomic prognostication has shifted the landscape of HPV-associated cancers. Efficacious and equitable prevention and treatment efforts for vulnerable groups requires an understanding of geographic, social and molecular determinants of HPV-associated cancers unique to these underserved and understudied populations. The goal of this proposed research proposal is to study how social determinants of health influences and interacts with molecular tumor markers to affect HPV-associated cancers. Dr. Mazul’s career goal is to become an independent researcher who is uniquely positioned to develop, conduct, and communicate research bridging cancer social determinant of health biology with social epidemiology. In the proposed training plan, Dr. Mazul will build upon her cancer epidemiologic skills to develop additional expertise in geospatial analysis and social epidemiologic methods, while expanding her cancer knowledge into HPV- associated cancer biology. Her training will be directly applied to support and advance her career as an independent researcher and the proposed research plan. Geospatial and social epidemiologic methods will be employed to understanding the interaction between social and molecular factors. We will use data from three sources representing national, Missouri statewide and local St. Louis HPV-associated cancer cases to compare the three most common HPV-associated cancers (oropharyngeal, cervical and anal). Three aims will address the overall hypothesis that poor neighborhood-level factors interact with molecular markers and to lead to poor HPV-associated cancer outcomes. Aim 1. Identify nationwide and statewide spatial clusters of HPV-associated cancers using geographic information systems and geospatial modeling. Aim 2: Measure the effect of neighborhood-level social and demographic factors on HPV- associated cancer stage at presentation and survival. Aim 3: Measure the prevalence and prognostic significance of HPV genotype in a demographically and socioeconomically diverse HPV-associated cancer population. Results from this study will provide a more nuanced assessment of the complex social and genomic factors linked with HPV-associated cancer. With this training and experience, Dr. Mazul will be well positioned to launch her independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE The incidence of cancers caused by the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) has been dramatically rising. The goal of this research is to reduce health disparities in HPV-associated cancer by defining regions in need of preventative intervention and determining how place (i.e. where someone lives) are associated with clinical and molecular tumor markers. The project will provide insight into how social and genomic factors contribute to HPV-associated cancer health disparities.",Integrating social and molecular determinants of HPV-associated

"Policy- and Provider-Level Determinants of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Disparities Among Young U.S. Women PROJECT SUMMARY Guided by Taplin et al.’s model of multilevel influences of the cancer care continuum, the proposed project investigates how state health policies and provider-level factors influence human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among sexual and racial/ethnic minority women. The project’s two specific aims are to: (1) examine the effect of state Medicaid expansions and HPV vaccine policies on HPV vaccination initiation among sexual and racial/ethnic minority U.S. women aged 15-25 years and (2) explore health care providers’ beliefs, attitudes, decision-making processes, and practices related to HPV vaccination among adolescent and young adult sexual and racial/ethnic minority women. I will address Aim 1 by using state-level data from the National Conference of State Legislatures and individual-level 2011-2015 National Survey of Family Growth data to conduct a difference-in-difference analysis that uses multivariable linear regression to assess the association between the implementation of state Medicaid expansions and HPV vaccine policies and the proportion of U.S. women aged 15-25 years who initiated HPV vaccination in relation to both sexual orientation identity and race/ethnicity (separately). I will address Aim 2 by conducting 30 in-depth interviews with health care providers selected using a purposive sampling approach and recruited from four Boston-area community health centers that provide care to underserved populations. I will analyze the provider interview transcripts using immersion/crystallization, the template organizing style of qualitative data analysis, discourse analysis, and within- and cross-case analysis. By engaging in mentored research with Dr. Deborah Bowen (Mentor) and collaborators, completing coursework, and participating in seminars, conferences, and regular mentoring meetings, I will develop expertise in three new areas critical to my development as an interdisciplinary, independent investigator who examines how factors at not only the patient but also the provider and policy levels influence cancer screening and prevention disparities: health services research, health policy, and advanced econometrics. Moreover, I will extend my grant writing and oral presentation skills by participating in grant writing courses and presenting at research meetings and seminars. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health offers junior scholars with the intellectual and practical resources they need to develop into successful independent investigators, including junior faculty seminars, grant writing, editing, and review services, and opportunities for intellectual exchange and collaboration with senior colleagues. A K01 award will provide me with the research experience, skills, and mentorship I need to build a cutting-edge independent research program that examines how factors at the patient, provider, and policy levels influence the utilization of cervical and other cancer prevention and screening services among underserved U.S. women and men. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although sexual and racial/ethnic minority women are at high risk of acquiring human papillomavirus (HPV) and developing cervical cancer, they are less likely than heterosexual and white women, respectively, to receive the HPV vaccine. Few studies have sought to empirically identify what underlying factors drive sexual orientation and racial/ethnic disparities in HPV vaccination among women, and this limited research has mostly focused on the role of individual-level health care factors – which is insufficient for informing interventions that effectively address disparities and prevent unnecessary suffering and deaths due to HPV-related cancers. The proposed 3-year project will thus focus on how factors at two critically important contextual levels most amenable to intervention – namely, the state health policy (i.e., Medicaid expansions, HPV vaccine policies) and provider (i.e., HPV vaccination beliefs, attitudes, decision-making, practices) levels – shape sexual orientation and racial/ethnic disparities in HPV vaccination among adolescent and young adult U.S. women and allow me to develop new knowledge and skills in health services research, health policy, and advanced econometric methods.",Policy- and Provider-Level

"Overcoming barriers to cancer screening among women living in rural and segregated communities PROJECT SUMMARY In 2018, 4,170 women will die from cervical cancer and 23,240 will die from colorectal cancer, yet many of these deaths avoidable through cancer screening. Cancer mortality rates and screening prevalence vary by geography, with women living in rural and racially-segregated areas more likely to die from, but less likely to screen for, these cancers compared to women in other areas. Women in rural and segregated areas face unique multilevel barriers to screening (e.g., low cancer risk perceptions, high travel burden). Home-based self- collection of human papillomavirus (HPV) tests for cervical cancer and fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) for colorectal cancer, paired with culturally-appropriate educational materials, could overcome these barriers. However, the successful implementation of such interventions in rural and segregated communities is understudied. The proposed study will use health behavior theory and intervention design and adaptation techniques to clarify person- and environment-level factors related to cancer screening among women in rural and segregated areas. In the proposed K22 project, the principal investigator (PI) and collaborators will conduct mixed methods formative research (including analysis of spatial data, in-depth interviews, surveys, and focus groups) to examine environment- and person-level correlates of cancer screening among women (ages 50-65 years) in rural, segregated areas (Aim 1). Using those findings, the team will adapt existing, evidence-based cancer screening educational materials, which will be delivered to eligible women in rural, segregated communities in conjunction with self-collected HPV tests and FIT (Aim 2). The team will examine feasibility and preliminary outcomes data for this pilot study to support an R01-level randomized hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of the intervention materials to improve cancer screening in these underserved and understudied communities. In addition to these research activities, the proposed K22 project includes several training activities to support the career development of the PI, Dr. Jennifer L. Moss. Dr. Moss’s long-term career goal is to become a scientific leader in transdisciplinary research on geographic disparities in cancer prevention behaviors and outcomes. Her short-term career goals include obtaining additional training in mixed methods analysis, intervention design, and grant writing. With protected time for research and further training, Dr. Moss can use the proposed K22 project to launch a career as an independent behavioral scientist contributing to the National Cancer Institute’s mission to reduce the burden of cancer in the population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening can reduce cancer mortality rates, including for cervical and colorectal cancers, but screening is lower and mortality is higher among people living in rural and segregated areas compared to people living elsewhere. The public health implications of the proposed project include the identification of novel, multilevel determinants of cancer screening among women in vulnerable areas using techniques from geospatial analysis, mixed methods, and intervention development and adaptation. Long-term, the findings from this project have the potential to reduce geographic disparities in cancer screening and burden and to lower overall rates of cancer in the population.",Overcoming barriers to cancer screening among women living in rural and segregated communities,9990717,K22CA225705,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' County ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' falls ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Research Activity ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Bryophyta ', ' Bryophyte ', ' Mosses ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' cancer risk ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' risk perception ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Collection ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' evidence base ', ' screening ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' rurality ', ' recruit ', ' annual screening ', ' routine screening ', ' effectiveness implementation trial ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' ']",NCI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,K22,2020,194944,0.03476396430196752
"Individual, Interpersonal, and Community Factors Associated with HPV Vaccine Hesitancy among Mexican American Young Adult Women PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Latina women, particularly Mexican Americans, have the highest incidence rates of cervical cancer compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Cervical cancer is preventable through HPV vaccination, but vaccination rates remain suboptimal, particularly among young adult Latina women. Additionally, foreign-born Latina women have lower cervical screening and HPV vaccination rates and often no access to preventive care prior to coming to the United States. Population studies have found significant differences in HPV vaccine completion among Latina foreign-born and U.S.-born young adults (18–26 years old), with foreign-born women less likely to vaccinate (7.2% vs 18.5%). Studies exploring HPV vaccine hesitancy are needed to inform scalable interventions to prevent infection and improve health outcomes that disproportionately burden Latina Mexican American women. The literature has not identified key multilevel mechanisms contributing to differences among Mexican American women in understanding their vaccine hesitancy. Studies on HPV vaccination differences among foreign-born and U.S.-born women are scarce. The goal of this mixed-methods study is to identify key factors contributing to HPV vaccine hesitancy among young adult Mexican American women that will inform effective public health vaccine interventions tailored for Latina subgroups in a future K- award. Previous qualitative studies have uncovered important differences in HPV vaccine decision-making among Latina young adults compared to other racial and ethnic groups. This study will build on past work by investigating hesitancy toward the HPV vaccine and the influence of individual, interpersonal, and community factors on vaccine hesitancy. The proposed study will explore two aims: (1) investigate what HPV messages Latinas receive and relay to others at the individual, interpersonal, and community levels and what meaning Latina women ascribe to the messages they receive; and (2) identify how mother-daughter communication is associated with HPV vaccine hesitancy in the context of important individual-, interpersonal-, and community- level factors. The unique strengths of this proposal include its focus on understanding multilevel influences explaining HPV vaccine hesitancy among at-risk Mexican American women. Additionally, a unique focus is studying differences between U.S.- and foreign-born Mexican American women. Finally, the applicant will benefit from a strong team of mentors and research environment with mentor specialties in health communication, health disparities, Latino health, and multilevel modeling. The proposed study is innovative in its proposed plan to understand how the effect of HPV messages may contribute to the vaccination gap between U.S.-born and foreign-born Latinas identified in the literature. Results of this study will inform HPV vaccine interventions tailored for Mexican American women and how community-based clinic interventions can be effectively implemented to reduce HPV-associated cancer by increasing HPV vaccination for this population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The long-term goal of this study is to decrease the costs of HPV-associated cancers that disproportionately burden Latina Mexican American women by identifying contributors to HPV vaccine hesitancy in this population. Using a multilevel approach, this study will assess individual, interpersonal, and community factors associated with HPV vaccine hesitancy among foreign-born and U.S.-born Mexican American women. Guided by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework, this study will use a health communication focus to identify HPV vaccine messages resonant among Mexican American women 18 to 26 years of age and that informs the development of a targeted communication intervention.","Individual, Interpersonal, and Community Factors Associated with HPV Vaccine Hesitancy

"Epidemiologic Impact of HPV Vaccination Project Summary Introduction of prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines has the potential to dramatically decrease morbidity and mortality from anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. However, data from vaccine clinical trials cannot predict vaccine effectiveness in “real-world” community settings, and introduction of a 9-valent (in addition to a 2- and 4-valent) vaccine in 2015 and reduced dosing schedules (from 3 to 2 doses) in 2016 could further modify vaccine effectiveness. The impact of vaccine introduction can be efficiently and accurately evaluated by HPV surveillance studies that assess vaccine effectiveness, herd protection, cross-protection (decrease in HPV types genetically related to vaccine types), and type replacement (increase in non-vaccine- type HPV due to a reduction in vaccine types). We previously conducted 4 HPV surveillance studies in women (2006-2017) and 2 in men (2013-2017). Among women, we found evidence for vaccine effectiveness (but lower effectiveness with 1 vs. 3 doses), herd protection, and cross-protection; no evidence for type- replacement; and an unexpected increase in non-vaccine-type HPV in unvaccinated women. Among men, we found preliminary evidence for vaccine effectiveness and herd protection. Continued investigation through the proposed renewal is essential to achieve the following objectives: 1) assess the effects of 9-valent vaccine introduction and reduced dosing schedules on effectiveness, 2) elucidate long-term trends in herd protection, 3) identify signals of diminished cross-protection or emerging type-replacement, and 4) determine mechanisms for increases in non-vaccine-type HPV in unvaccinated women. The specific aims are to: 1) determine long- term trends in 4-valent - and emerging trends in 9-valent - HPV prevalence among vaccinated women (2006- 2023) and men (2013-2023) to assess HPV vaccine effectiveness, and among unvaccinated women and men to assess herd protection; 2) assess the differential impact of the number of vaccine doses received on vaccine-type HPV, by age; 3) determine trends in non-vaccine-type HPV prevalence among vaccinated women and men, to examine for persistent cross-protection and emerging type replacement; and 3) explore biological and behavioral mechanisms for the increase in non-vaccine-type HPV in unvaccinated women. Our approach will be to enroll 1,600 women and men in two additional surveillance studies, to characterize the impact of vaccine introduction across a total of 6 time periods in women (2006-2023, N=2,400) and 4 in men (2013- 2023, N=1,600). The proposed research is innovative because the resulting data could shift current research and clinical practice paradigms in the areas of vaccination and virology, and the research plan utilizes novel concepts, approaches and new methodologies to explore mechanisms driving HPV trends. The proposed research is significant because the data will provide key evidence for: 1) vaccination and cervical cancer screening programs; 2) public health communications and risk-reduction counseling; and 3) cost-effectiveness analysis and policy decisions: these will help to reduce disparities and mortality due to HPV-related cancers. Narrative In this study, we will characterize the epidemiologic impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine introduction from 2006 to 2023, among diverse populations of young women and men in a community. The study will provide a comprehensive assessment of the post-marketing impact of HPV vaccine introduction, including 9- valent HPV vaccine introduction and reduced dosing schedules, and will provide key evidence for HPV vaccine recommendations, cervical cancer screening programs, public health messaging, cost-effectiveness analysis, and policy decisions that aim to reduce rates of cervical cancer and other HPV-associated cancers.

"Framing HPV Vaccination Messages for African American Parents PROJECT SUMMARY The 2014 President’s Cancer Panel called underuse of HPV vaccines “a serious, but correctable threat to progress against cancer.” The Cancer Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel, more recently, identified expanding the use of HPV vaccines as a top priority for cancer prevention, especially in medically underserved populations. The overarching goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel, theory-based message framing intervention to accelerate HPV vaccine uptake among African American adolescents. Based on prospect theory and the health belief model, this project aims to 1) develop culturally appropriate messages framed in gains and losses and pretest these messages through community engagement; 2) determine whether/how the effects of message framing (gain vs. loss) on African American parents’ acceptance of the HPV vaccine are moderated by their prior beliefs about HPV and the HPV vaccine; and 3) evaluate the efficacy of a message framing intervention rooted in message targeting principles utilizing mobile tablets for efficient targeting through a clinic-based randomized trial. The proposed project will generate key insights into the persuasive effects of message framing as applied to the promotion of HPV vaccination. It will produce solid empirical evidence surrounding a novel, theory-based message framing intervention aimed at accelerating HPV vaccine uptake among African American adolescents. Addressing a critical aspect of health disparities disadvantaging the African American community, this research represents a systematic and timely effort to respond to the call of the 2014 President’s Cancer Panel on the urgency of optimizing communication strategies for promoting HPV vaccination among key stakeholders. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project addresses a major public health concern – low HPV vaccination rates among adolescents – and represents a timely effort to develop effective communication interventions for promoting HPV vaccination. By examining HPV vaccination communication strategies that resonate with African American parents, the proposed project also addresses critical health disparities in HPV-related cancers. With its focus on developing and evaluating a theory-based message framing intervention, the proposed project will not only advance communication science bearing direct relevance to public health promotion, particularly the promotion of HPV vaccination, but also make a significant step forward toward translating basic behavioral science underlying vaccine communication into community-based interventions.",Framing HPV Vaccination Messages for African American Parents,9848440,R01CA219060,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Attitude ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Belief ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Exercise ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Interview ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Woman ', ' falls ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' Solid ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' cancer prevention ', ' HPV infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' age group ', ' novel ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically underserved population ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HPV-Related Malignancy ', ' HPV-associated cancer ', ' HPV-associated malignancy ', ' HPV-related cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignancy ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-associated cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-associated malignancy ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-related cancer ', ' Human papillomavirus-Related Malignancy ', ' Human papillomavirus-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' human papillomavirus associated malignancy ', ' human papillomavirus-associated cancer ', ' human papillomavirus-related cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', "" President's Cancer Panel "", ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' Basic Behavioral Science ', ' 12 years of age ', ' age 12 years ', ' twelve year old ', ' twelve years of age ', ' 12 year old ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' adolescent man ', ' adolescent men ', ' young man ', ' adolescent woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' young woman ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' persistent infection ', ' chronic infection ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,447486,0.14594476763234612
"Improving Uptake of Cervical Cancer Prevention Services in Appalachia PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL The goal of this Program Project is to address the burden of cervical cancer incidence and mortality in Appalachia through the delivery of a clinic-based integrated prevention program that focuses on the major causes of cervical cancer (tobacco smoking, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and lack of cervical cancer screening) designed to target individual, social and community, health system and broader contextual-level barriers related to the burden of cervical cancer. Building upon our long history of collaborative research and community partnerships, the Program will test the effectiveness of health system-based interventions focused on tobacco use, HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening (Pap test and/or self-testing with follow-up of positive tests), as part of an integrated clinic-based cervical cancer prevention program. The multi-level interventions (directed to three levels of influence – clinic, provider and patient) will be offered to eligible female patients and age-eligible children and young adults in four Appalachian states (Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia). Our research process is guided by a socio-ecological model based on the Social Determinants of Health, the Proctor Model for Implementation Science and a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) framework. The aims of this Program Project are to: 1) Test the effectiveness of an integrated cervical cancer prevention program, consisting of three established interventions, designed to address three causes of cervical cancer in a region with one of the highest cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in the United States; and 2) Evaluate the impact of the cervical cancer prevention program, including implementation, and acceptability, with attention to both short- and long-term impact and sustainability at the clinics. Four cores – Intervention and Consortium, Survey and Data Collection, Biostatistics and Evaluation, and Administrative – will facilitate the smooth and integrated operation of all projects. Integration and interaction of the projects in this Program is evident in several ways: 1) all projects focus on one health disparity; 2) participants will be recruited from the same health systems; 3) a core set of measures is being used by all projects; 4) all projects include transdisciplinary teams; 5) all projects build upon and extend findings from our long history of collaborative research and community partnerships; 6) all projects focus on multi-level assessment and/or interventions using the Warnecke model as a framework and utilize the Proctor et al. Implementation Science Framework; 7) all projects involve interaction with the community in some way, thus enhancing the CBPR nature of the Program; and 8) evaluation will assess implementation, service and client outcomes at the project and overall Program levels including: cost, satisfaction, effectiveness, sustainability, and safety, to name a few outcomes. If successful, this Program Project will provide evidence for a novel and innovative approach to address disparities in underserved communities with plans for sustainability and dissemination, as well as cost-effectiveness data.

"Acceptability and feasibility of combination treatment for cervical precancer among South Africa women living with HIV ABSTRACT Cancer incidence, mortality, and disparities between rich and poor are projected to rise at staggering rates. It is estimated, for example, that cancer will kill one million Africans each year by 2030, with cervical cancer accounting for the most cancer deaths in African women. Global efforts to eliminate cervical cancer are currently focused on expanding access to HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening. However, these efforts lack equal investment in treatment of precancerous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 (CIN2/3), particularly among HIV-infected women. This gap leaves a generation of HIV-infected women at high risk of persistent/recurrent CIN2/3 and progression to cervical cancer because standard treatment for CIN2/3 (excision or ablation) is far less effective in this population. The need for novel treatment approaches for CIN2/3 in HIV- infected women is therefore substantial. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that topical 5-fluorouracil (5FU), a widely available low-cost generic drug, can be repurposed as a patient-controlled, adjuvant treatment for CIN2/3 after surgical excision to reduce the risk of persistent/recurrent CIN2/3 and progression to cervical cancer among HIV-infected women. Our overarching goal is to build on U.S. efficacy studies and test the acceptability and feasibility of combination treatment for CIN2/3 (i.e., surgical excision followed by self- applied adjuvant 5FU) in a low-resource setting. First, we will explore South African perspectives on current cervical cancer prevention strategies and identify barriers to and facilitators of combination treatment in the local context. We will accomplish this through a series of focus groups and in-depth interviews with diverse stakeholders (HIV-infected women, male partners, healthcare personnel). Second, and informed by our formative research, we will conduct a feasibility trial of the combination treatment strategy to determine safety, tolerability, adherence, and retention. We will randomize 180 HIV-infected women with CIN2/3 who will undergo loop excision (LEEP) followed by self-apply 5FU versus placebo (8 doses, once every 2 weeks). Women will be followed for 24 weeks. Third, to better understand the immune response to combination treatment in HIV-infected women, we will assess changes in genital HIV-1 shedding and local immune activation associated with surgical excision followed by 5FU/placebo. Our study will be conducted in South Africa, where more than 4 million women are living with HIV and women’s lifetime risk of cervical cancer is among the highest in the world. If successful, our findings will have broad relevance for HIV-infected women in both resource-rich and resource-poor regions worldwide, including rural and remote areas of the U.S. NARRATIVE Women living with HIV are at increased risk of precancerous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2/3) and standard treatment modalities for CIN2/3 are less effective in HIV-infected women. We propose to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility (safety, tolerability, adherence, retention), and preliminary efficacy of a combination treatment strategy (i.e., surgery followed by topical therapy with 5% 5-fluorouracil [5FU]) in order to improve cervical cancer prevention and long-term treatment outcomes in this high-risk population. If successful, our proposed combination strategy would have broad relevance for women living with HIV in both resource-rich and resource-poor regions worldwide, including rural and remote areas of the

"Implementing Cancer Prevention Using Patient - Provider Clinical Decision Support ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of U.S. adults and adolescents do not receive key evidence-based preventive care services. Rural populations are especially disadvantaged with multiple healthcare disparities, resulting in lower rates of primary and secondary cancer prevention interventions. The objective of this project is to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a sophisticated Web-based, electronic health record (EHR)-linked clinical decision support (CDS) system designed to improve primary and secondary cancer preventive care. To achieve this objective, we link EHR data to evidence-based cancer prevention algorithms in a secure Web site to: (a) identify at the point of care all eligible patients not up o date on their cancer prevention interventions; and (b) present to both patient and primary care provider (PCP) and/or a key member of the primary care team, certified medical assistant (CMA), appropriate evidence-based primary cancer prevention interventions and cancer screening options at the point of care. The Cancer Prevention-CDS will focus on breast cancer screening in women aged 50-74, colorectal cancer screening for both sexes aged 50-75, cervical cancer screening for women aged 21-65, human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination for both sexes aged 11-26, and referrals for weight management and smoking cessation in all adults aged 18 and older. Effectiveness is assessed by cluster-randomizing 30 primary care clinics with roughly 285 PCPs and 153,000 study-eligible patients into one of three experimental conditions: Group 1: PCP-focused CDS intervention in which the PCP triggers use of the CDS system and engages patients in appropriate cancer prevention strategies. Group 2: CMA-focused CDS intervention in which the CMA triggers use of the CDS system and interacts with the patient to engage them in appropriate cancer prevention strategies before seeing their PCP, who will approve or discuss the plan with their patient. Group 3 clinics provide usual care with no intervention-related activity related to cancer prevention. With 10 clinics, 95 PCPs, and 51,000 potentially eligible patients per study arm, this study will formally test the hypothesis tht Groups 1 and 2 are superior to Group 3 over an 18-month follow-up period with respect to: (a) significantly higher rates of appropriate screening for breast, cervix, and colorectal cancer, as defined by the United States Preventive Services Task Force; and (b) significantly higher rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in males and females aged 11-26 years. We further posit that Groups 1 and 2 will have higher short-term health care costs but better long-term cost-effectiveness than Group 3. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and RE-AIM conceptual frameworks will be used to guide implementation planning, organization, conduct, and impact evaluation of the intervention in a large rural healthcare system. This project will engage a rural population with substantial healthcare disparities and gaps in the receipt of primary and secondary cancer prevention. Results will advance dissemination and implementation research methods that can reduce health disparities and improve healthcare for millions in medically underserved areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If primary and secondary prevention practices for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer were improved, more than 100,000 cancer deaths a year could be delayed or averted in the United States and the burden of these diseases on quality of life reduced. In this project, we will adapt, implement, and evaluate a proven electronic health record-linked, Web-based, personalized clinical decision support system to identify patients needing primary and/or secondary cancer prevention care. The objectives of this project are to improve the quality and consistency of primary and secondary prevention of common cancers in rural areas by providing patient- centered and evidence-based treatment recommendations to both primary care provider teams and patients at the point of care and provide an efficient and effective model for implementation and dissemination of cancer prevention in rural settings.",Implementing Cancer Prevention Using Patient -

"Point-of-care screening test for early cervical cancer detection SUMMARY ABSTRACT  Although cervical cancer is an easily curable disease if detected early, it continues to claim the lives of hundreds of thousands of women worldwide. Healthcare disparities have resulted in cervical cancer incidence and mortality that are five times higher in low and middle income countries (LMICs) than in high-income countries. In the United States, cervical cancer mortality rates are twice as high among rural women than their urban counterparts. The wide disparity in cervical cancer incidence rates and deaths is attributed to both higher HPV infection rates and a lack of accessible screening and treatment of pre-invasive cervical lesions.  The current standard of care in the US, a cytology-based Pap smear, requires resource intensive laboratory and clinical specialists with a long turnaround time from sample collection to result. Alternatives, such as visual inspection with acetic acid and emerging HPV-targeted tests, have poor specificity for cervical cancer, leading to overtreatment that can cause complications including infertility and pre-term births and that further the burden on limited healthcare resources. This proposal aims to create an integrated point-of-care screening test that can be used by healthcare providers in under-resourced settings to obtain relevant clinical insights, including cervical cancer risk stratification, and enable same-visit treatment of high risk cervical lesions.  Building on our preliminary development of a highly sensitive paper-based immunoassay to test for the key cervical cancer biomarker, valosin containing protein (VCP), the objective of this proposal is to combine VCP detection with three other known cervical cancer protein biomarkers, in a sensitive and specific single-step point- of-care assay.  Specific milestones include:  1) Integrating and optimizing multiplex detection of cervical cancer biomarkers into a simple paper-based sample-to-answer device.  2) Evaluating the operational and performance metrics of the test in retrospective cervical swab samples.  The outcome of this proposal will be a highly characterized point-of-care test with high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (90%) to detect high-risk cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cervical cancer within 40 minutes. This affordable solution for cervical cancer screening and control programs will be applicable in LMICs and will provide highly sensitive monitoring of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in the US, where it will be especially impactful in high-risk populations that are currently underserved by existing screening programs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Due to disparities in healthcare access, women in rural America and other low-resource settings worldwide are twice as likely to die from cervical cancer as their urban and high-resource counterparts. We will develop a paper- based sample-to-answer test that provides sensitive and specific detection of high-risk pre-cancer and invasive cervical cancer at the point-of-care. This test will enable rapid screening and reduce barriers to same-visit treatment, ultimately reducing cervical cancer disparities by saving the lives of patients whose disease would have otherwise be

"Enhancing the Effectiveness of Community Health Workers to Reduce Cervical Cancer Disparities in African American Women PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  African American women are almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer (CC) as white women. Their initial clinical picture is also more negative, characterized by more severe dysplastic changes and later-stage disease. Given this, it is not surprising that Black women are also more than twice as likely to die from CC as compared to white women. Even worse, these survival disparities persist irrespective of tumor stage at initial diagnosis. It does not have to be this way. CC is completely preventable.  Broad uptake of HPV vaccination and adherence to cervical screening guidelines (with proper follow-up) would virtually eliminate all new cases of CC. Unfortunately, only 42% of young adult Black women have received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine compared to 52% of white women. Corrected self-report data show that only 58% of Black women are adherent to screening guidelines compared to 73% of white women.  In previous pilot work, we developed and tested a mobile CC navigation intervention for African American women. An integrated web-based risk assessment allowed our SMS software app to select from a library of videos and text-based messages specifically tailored for each user’s particular cervical health prevention challenges. This prototype included 3 types of videos (scripted vignettes, unscripted peer narratives, and educational instruction) and 3 types of text messages (reminder, educational, and supportive). Usability testing strongly supported the feasibility and potential effectiveness of this patient-facing intervention.  We are proposing to build on this pilot work by developing a digital dashboard that integrates with our mobile navigation intervention and with electronic health records (EHR). This integrated package will be for community health workers (CHWs) who provide navigation services. This new analytic tool will provide CHWs a unified, graphical view of their navigation data in real-time at the patient-level, case-level, and encounter- level. All navigation data will be presented visually, relying on a diverse array of graphical elements.  We will recruit 16 target end-users who provide cancer prevention navigation services in a range of workplace settings to participate in focus groups. Participants will be asked to judge the adequacy of the layout, structure, and functionality of the planned dashboard. In addition, we will recruit executive leaders, directors, implementation/project managers, and end users who have either upstream or downstream touch points with EHR workflows for individual interviews (total N=12). These discussions will focus on the challenges and opportunities of integrating the proposed mHealth tools into EHR workflows. Based on what we learn from these groups and our expert team of consultants, we will then develop a prototype dashboard. When completed, the 16 target end-users will return for usability testing. The usability test will involve completing a series of tasks intended to simulate how a typical end-user would experience the functionality of the fully developed dashboard. Three usability metrics will be assessed: efficiency, accuracy, and subjective satisfaction. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop mobile tools that will increase the rates of HPV vaccination and Pap testing among African American women.

"Comparative Modeling to Inform Cervical Cancer Control Policies Project Summary Despite successful cervical cancer screening in the United States (US), over 13,000 women develop and 4,000 women die from cervical cancer each year. The discovery of human papillomavirus (HPV) as the necessary cause of cervical cancer precipitated a surge of new evidence and development of innovative HPV-based technologies, both screening and prophylactic vaccination, that have allowed for significant changes in our approach to cervical cancer control over the past two decades. These new technologies represent tremendous opportunities for effective, equitable, and efficient cervical cancer programs in the US but also pose significant challenges for decision-making. Given the limited availability of outcomes data for new screening and vaccination approaches from empirical studies, policy-makers have become uniquely reliant on mathematical modeling to provide a synthesized evidence base for decision-making for cervical cancer control strategies. These models can be used to integrate the most up-to-date data, extrapolate short-term findings into long-term outcomes, and evaluate what-if scenarios that would otherwise be impractical or infeasible to conduct in clinical studies. The proposed CISNET project will represent the continued, productive collaboration of five independent modeling groups from the US, Australia, and the Netherlands that will leverage a series of state- of-the-art mathematical models of HPV and cervical carcinogenesis for comparative modeling. We will pursue analyses related to the impact of newly-revised screening and HPV vaccination guidelines, the comparative effectiveness of forthcoming screening and HPV vaccination strategies and approaches, the optimal routes for reducing cervical cancer disparities, the potential for cervical cancer elimination in the US, and optimal screening and vaccination strategies in women living with HIV. Our efforts will also involve wide dissemination of findings to various stakeholders to increase transparency and confidence in model-based analyses. Project Narrative New technologies, including screening tests and vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually- transmitted virus known to cause cervical cancer, are dramatically changing the landscape of cervical cancer control in the US and worldwide. In order to address important evidence gaps, our CISNET-Cervical working group – consisting of five teams who have been at the forefront of modeling cervical cancer prevention over the last decade – will continue this comparative modeling collaboration to evaluate the harms, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of screening and vaccination strategies, and disseminate findings to inform health policies and decisions.",Comparative Modeling to Inform Cervical Cancer Control Policies,10069561,U01CA253912,"['Australia ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Infection ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Kenya ', ' Netherlands ', ' New Mexico ', ' North Dakota ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' South Africa ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Uganda ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Woman ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' prophylactic ', ' Route ', ' Country ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HPV-Related Malignancy ', ' HPV-associated cancer ', ' HPV-associated malignancy ', ' HPV-related cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignancy ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-associated cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-associated malignancy ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-related cancer ', ' Human papillomavirus-Related Malignancy ', ' Human papillomavirus-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' human papillomavirus associated malignancy ', ' human papillomavirus-associated cancer ', ' human papillomavirus-related cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Address ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Data ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' CISNET ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Comparative Carcinogenesis ', ' Update ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' cost ', ' vaccination strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' comparative ', ' evidence base ', ' screening ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' coinfection ', ' co-infection ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' sexually transmitted virus ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' screening guidelines ', ' cervical carcinogenesis ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,U01,2020,1370142,0.2792693859530769
"Sex-based differences in oral HPV infections and outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY - Sex-based differences in oral HPV infections and outcomes Many infectious diseases exhibit differential severity between the sexes yet the mechanisms driving such innate biases are incompletely understood. The prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) oral infections and HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers are 3- to 5-fold more common in men than women. This correlates only partially (~18%) with behavioral risk factors which would indicate that males have higher HPV exposure. Other possible explanations include increased susceptibility to infection on a cellular level or decreased ability to clear infections. Papillomavirus (PV) infections are predominantly confined to keratinocytes, which are the only permissive cells in the epithelium. We are poised to determine whether male-derived keratinocytes and/or tissues have increased inherent susceptibility to PV infections and, in the process, we expect to identify cell factors that are differentially regulated in keratinocytes making them more susceptible to infection versus keratinocytes more resistant to infection. During the initial stages of an HPV or animal PV infection, the host keratinocytes possess a number of intrinsic (restriction) factors that can inhibit the establishment of infection. Additionally, innate immune signaling in keratinocytes determines whether innate effector cells are recruited and whether an effective adaptive immune response ensues. These keratinocyte-specific activities are likely to have a role in determining whether a PV infection will become persistent or will be cleared. Persistent HPV infections are more likely to progress to cancers. Clinical and epidemiological studies indicate a role for sex hormones in HPV pathology of the female genital tract; however, it is unclear whether the influence of sex hormones is due to increased HPV infection, increased viral persistence, or differential immunological regulation. In this application, we focus on the role of the host keratinocyte in the initial control of PV infection. Our decades of ground-work in studying molecular mechanisms controlling PV infections will permit us to determine whether/how sex-based differences impact the keratinocyte response to PV infection. In Aim 1 we will use a novel PV infection assay to quantitatively determine the susceptibility of human oral keratinocytes from male and female donors to HPV16 infection. In Aim 2 we will assess the susceptibility of male and female BALB/c FoxN1nu/nu mice to MmuPV1 infection and tumor formation. Five males and five females will be used to determine if the sexes differ in onset and extent of tumor formation. For each aim, we will assay infections and viral gene expression levels and correlate these with the expression of viral restriction factors and immune modulators in infected cells. We expect this pilot work to yield data foundational for a follow-up studies aimed to define more mechanistically the explanations for sex-based disparities in oncogenic HPV infections of the oral cavity.

"Multi-level Optimization of the Cervical Cancer Screening Process in Diverse Settings & Populations (METRICS) ABSTRACT For more than 5 decades, the US has sought to lower cervical cancer deaths through screening; however, disparities remain. Introduction of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV)-based tests and HPV vaccines have expanded cervical cancer prevention strategies and changed screening and management guidelines. As technology, guidelines, and policies change, our MultilEvel OpTimization of the CeRvIcal Cancer Screening Process in Diverse Settings & Populations (METRICS) PROSPR II Research Center will elucidate multilevel factors that hamper or facilitate the cervical cancer screening process and reduce disparities in vulnerable populations. METRICS unites three PROSPR I Research Centers with demonstrated capability to provide validated data for a combined cohort of ~1.2 million screened and unscreened women. Our community settings represent 3 care delivery models—safety-net system, managed care system, and primary care provider networks in Texas, Washington, and Massachusetts. We will collect, harmonize, and document > 10 years of high-quality, comprehensive cervical cancer screening process data at the patient, provider, clinic, and system levels using a rich array of electronic clinical information systems and novel data sources. Our combined cohort is socioeconomically and geographically diverse and includes vulnerable groups such as HIV-infected and uninsured women. Our three interconnected observational projects are designed to understand how cervical cancer screening is delivered across our spectrum of delivery models, and how to optimize the screening process to reduce disparities. Innovative geospatial and Bayesian statistical methods in Project 1 will better elucidate at what levels variation in screening process occurs. Project 2 will investigate how multilevel programs and policies influence adherence to guidelines for average-risk women. Project 3 will inform precision screening for women with altered risk. Based on our observational findings, in years 4-5, we will design and implement pilot interventions leveraging IT-enabled tools to address key failures in the screening process and reduce disparities. Our transdisciplinary team has epidemiologists, primary and specialty care physicians, and intervention, implementation, and healthcare delivery experts. We are poised to efficiently evaluate the full cervical cancer screening process and provide expertise, leadership, and resources for cross-organ PROSPR II collaborations. Our cores and research projects will achieve our goals of advancing understanding of screening as practiced in community settings through: (1) analysis of multilevel observational data from our heterogeneous settings with diverse populations, (2) development and testing of impactful interventions to optimize the screening process, and (3) application of our novel observational projects and quality metrics to the cancer screening processes for other organs. Based on our successful experience leading and collaborating in PROSPR I, we thoughtfully organized our four cores to be able to launch research activities and contribute to trans-PROSPR II activities quickly and effectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE The METRICS PROSPR II Research Center will study delivery of cervical cancer screening and treatment in three diverse U.S. community healthcare systems. Recently, guidelines for screening and treatment have become more complex with introduction of new tests and prevention methods (HPV vaccine). We will examine how programs and policies influence the care that women receive, the ideal personalized screening strategy for women with lower or higher cancer risk (such as HIV+), and the impact of pilot interventions to improve care, with a focus on reducing disparities.",Multi-level Optimization of the Cervical Cancer Screening Process in Diverse Settings & Populations

"Tri-City Cervical Cancer Prevention Study among Women in the Justice System ABSTRACT  Women with criminal justice histories persist as one of the groups most affected by cervical cancer, with 4- 5 times the rates of cancer compared to other women. Our research team has spent the last 8 years investigating the factors that account for this disparity. We have found that abnormal Pap tests are high, with sexual health risk, trauma, women's life circumstances, and low cervical health literacy as facilitators of risk and barriers to care. But questions remain about justice-involved women's screening trajectories over time given complex cervical screening recommendations and the difficulty of interfacing with health systems and navigating complex health insurance environments. Thus, there is insufficient information available to inform interventions that address justice-involved women's cervical cancer prevention needs in the community.  The specific objective of this study is to develop a better understanding of the natural history of cervical cancer risk and prevention behaviors among community-based justice-involved women. The long-term goal of this study is to identify strategies for where and how to intervene to change the factors and environments that structure women's cervical health risk.  We have a unique opportunity to conduct a natural history study of cervical health risk and screening among community-based justice-involved women in three geographically and demographically diverse cities. We plan to leverage three existing samples of community-based, justice-involved women – in Kansas City, MO, Birmingham, AL, and Oakland, CA – to become one of the first long-term cancer prevention studies of high-risk women across cities in the U.S. By studying three geographically and demographically diverse cities, we can draw conclusions about factors at each level of inquiry across study sites, accounting for variation in cities and increasing our ability to generalize findings. By leveraging samples generated by our ongoing projects in each city, we also offer a cost-effective and feasible way to engage in long-term follow-up of hard to reach women, with whom we've already established trust and rapport.  In our first aim, we use the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations (BMVP) to explain the natural history of cervical health risk behaviors, screening, and treatment among community-based justice-involved women (N~600) over a 5-year period in three cities. In the second aim, we use a mixed methods approach to unpack the ways in which significant domains of the BMVP operate in the daily lives of a subsample of women (N~60) recruited from the larger sample.  Public health significance of this study centers on two products: 1) Development of a multi-level conceptual framework that explains the environment in which justice-involved women engage in cervical cancer prevention. 2) Creation of intervention models that address “upstream” determinants of health in clinical and service settings, while addressing justice-involved women's unique needs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study is significant because it capitalizes on a rare opportunity to study cervical cancer risk and prevention behaviors among community-based justice-involved women in three distinct cities, factoring in sociodemographic differences of women, unique policy, and service environments, which will inform subsequent intervention design, implementation, and impact in multiple contexts, increasing generalizability and reach of interventions to justice-involved women in U.S. cities. The natural history design will allow us to trace women's real-life cervical health trajectories, as women navigate the complex recommendations for cancer prevention in the tumultuous reality of their post-incarceration lives, providing a detailed picture of where women fail and where systems fail women when it comes to cervical cancer prevention.",Tri-City Cervical Cancer Prevention Study among Women in the Justice System,9828540,R01CA226838,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Cities ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Housing ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Interview ', ' Justice ', ' Kansas ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Pap smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Pap screening ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' Cervical ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' probation ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Jail ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' long-term followup ', ' longterm followup ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Clinical Services ', ' health literacy ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' screening ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' Service setting ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' screening guidelines ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,599368,0.18965135323365306
"A tailored, health communication intervention for HPV vaccine hesitant families Abstract The human papillomavirus (HPV) causes 90% of cervical cancers and is implicated in multiple other cancers. The HPV vaccine can prevent the vast majority of these cancers, but it is underused in adolescents, especially among those within vaccine hesitant (VH) parents. Dr. Erves, an Assistant Professor in Research at Meharry Medical College and Adjunct Assistant Professor at Vanderbilt University, is poised to become a leader in behavioral cancer prevention research. This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will complement her in-depth training in public health research methods, statistical analysis, patient centered outcomes research, and community engagement obtained during her doctoral, post-doctoral, and early career experiences. It will provide the training she needs to further her current cancer prevention research program, characterizing preferences and perceived needs of African American adolescents and parents when deciding about HPV vaccination for cancer prevention. Dr. Erves short-term goals are to become proficient in behavioral intervention development, an expert in conducting clinical trials, and knowledgeable of implementation science by engaging in didactic, clinical research training activities; conducting a pilot, randomized clinical trial; submitting an R01 in Year 3 of this award; increasing manuscript publications; and advancing leadership through scientific presentations. Her mentors include highly-qualified experts in community engagement and clinical trials (Dr. Consuelo Wilkins), HPV vaccination and behavioral interventions (Dr. Pamela Hull), and vaccine hesitancy, clinical interventions, and implementation science (Dr. Amanda Dempsey). State-of-the-art facilities and vast resources at Meharry Medical College and Vanderbilt University provide the environment needed to promote her career development, and complete the proposed research successfully. The proposed research is to develop and pilot test a tailored, health communication intervention aimed to increase HPV vaccination among VH parents. The research will add knowledge on how tailored education provided before a doctor’s visit can play a role in improving HPV vaccination rates among underserved, VH parents. The study aims to develop a tailored, health communication intervention for HPV VH parents (AIM 1); conduct a pilot study of the intervention and study protocol on a small scale to demonstrate feasibility of a future full-scale randomized control trial (RCT) (AIM 2); and examine acceptability of the protocol and intervention among parents and providers (AIM 3). The proposed research is innovative because no evidence-based health communication interventions target HPV VH parents, and we will use stakeholder engagement throughout this study. The knowledge, experience, and pilot data provided by this award will prepare Dr. Erves to secure subsequent R01 funding to assess the intervention’s efficacy in a well-powered RCT and advance her multidisciplinary, research program on behavioral interventions to increase HPV vaccine rates. This award will allow her to establish an independent, long-term career focused more broadly on cancer prevention behaviors. Public Health Relevance Statement/Project Narrative Improving HPV vaccine rates among adolescents in vaccine hesitant parents is key to improving HPV vaccine rates among poor, underserved adolescents, a population with a higher incidence of HPV-associated cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, and anus. This proposed research is innovative because it provides tailored education prior to the medical visit and applies stakeholder engagement at each stage of the research process. The proposed training and research will prepare the candidate to further the field of cancer prevention behaviors through reducing HPV-associated cancers among underserved populations, while promoting a future career in the broader field of public health oncology.","A tailored, health communication intervention for HPV vaccine hesitant families",9892286,K01CA237748,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anus ', '

"Randomized controlled trial of an implementation science tool to increase cervical cancer screening in Mombasa, Kenya ABSTRACT Summary of Proposal: This proposal supports a 4-year research and training program to allow Dr. Eastment to make substantial progress toward a career as an independent investigator and leader in the field of women’s health and cervical cancer screening implementation. She aims to quantify the cervical cancer screening care cascade and understand the correlates of appropriate screening. She will then conduct a cluster randomized trial to test an implementation science tool, the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA), to improve cervical cancer screening for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women in Mombasa, Kenya. A budget impact analysis of SAIA will be performed for Mombasa County Department of Health (DOH). Dr. Eastment’s expertise in coordinating studies in Kenya utilizing the same implementation science tool provides a strong foundation for this proposed plan. Her training program will include further instruction in study design, economic evaluations, analysis of correlated data, and implementation science from leaders in these fields, leveraging on the outstanding research and training environments at the University of Washington (UW), and the strength of long- term collaborations with Mombasa County. Her collection of mentors from the UW Departments of Medicine, Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Global health, along with her collaborators from Mombasa County, are eager to mentor and support Dr. Eastment’s project and career development. Research Plan: Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women in sub-Saharan Africa, and the majority of cervical cancer mortality occur in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Many of the disparities between high and LMICs are attributed to differences in screening. Kenyan guidelines recommend screening with visual inspection methods followed by treatment of pre-cancerous lesions with cryotherapy and loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). Implementation of these are poor with only 14% of Kenyan women ever having been screened for cervical cancer as of 2014. To address this implementation gap, this application proposes three aims. In Aim 1, we will describe the cervical cancer screening care cascade, from identification of female clients age 21-65 years old, through referral for follow-up of clients with positive or suspicious screens, in family planning (FP) clinics in Mombasa County. Following characterization of this cascade, we will conduct an analysis of correlates of failure to screen for cervical cancer in FP clients seen over a one-year period in Mombasa County. Aim 2 will test whether SAIA increases cervical cancer screening compared to usual procedures in a cluster randomized trial in 20 FP clinics in Mombasa County. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the cost and budget impact of using SAIA to increase cervical cancer screening in FP clinics in Mombasa County. The results of this study have the potential to improve cervical cancer screening, and inform policy in the Mombasa DOH for a fiscally responsible evidenced-based approach for cervical cancer screening. The long-term goal is to decrease cervical cancer mortality and improve women’s health. NARRATIVE McKenna Eastment, MD, MPH is a Senior Fellow/Acting Instructor in the Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the Department of Medicine at the University of Washington. This K08 award, with the career development plan and research proposal, aims to provide Dr. Eastment with mentorship in conducting a clinical trial testing an implementation science tool to improve cervical cancer screening for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women in Mombasa, Kenya. These research findings have the potential for generalizability throughout Kenya and to other low and middle-income countries to decrease cervical cancer mortality by increasing screening and improving linkage to treatment of pre-cancerous lesions.","Randomized controlled trial of an implementation science tool to increase cervical cancer screening in Mombasa, Kenya",9957033,K08CA228761,"['Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Career Mobility ', ' career advancement ', ' career transition ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Family Planning ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Cold Therapy ', ' Cryotherapy ', ' Therapeutic Cold ', ' Cytology ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Kenya ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Web App Technology for Boys and Parents: Improving HPV Vaccine Uptake The President's Cancer Advisory Board and the Centers for Disease Control have called for renewed efforts in promoting vaccination for Human Papillomavirus (HPV), including vaccination for adolescent boys, because the uptake of this new vaccine remains alarmingly low. Currently, less than 15% of adolescent boys have received the HPV vaccine; thus, most of this population remains at risk for oropharyngeal, anal, and penile cancers. Many parents remain unconvinced of the safety and effectiveness of HPV vaccines, so effective and accessible messaging to improve decision-making on this vaccine is needed. Parents of adolescent boys also have different concerns about HPV vaccination than for adolescent girls, creating a need for unique health communication interventions to promote vaccine uptake among boys. Interventions also need to address the unique challenges of minority populations and populations for whom English is not the first language. A novel digital intervention will be produced and evaluated for its ability to improve HPV vaccine outcomes. Specifically, a mobile responsive web application (“mobile web app”) will be created that performs similar to a mobile app but runs on a variety of computing platforms from personal desktop and laptop computers to the latest smart phones and tablet computers. Mobile web app content will be targeted to parents and adolescent boys aged 11-13 years living in New Mexico, a majority-minority population with large proportions of Hispanics, Whites, and Native Americans. The specific aims are to: 1) carefully and systematically develop a mobile web app (BoyVac) for smart phones, tablet computers, and personal computers that will utilize Diffusion of Innovations principles to provide targeted information concerning HPV vaccine adoption to adolescent males and their parents, particularly minority adolescents and parents; 2) implement a comprehensive and rigorous test of the impact of the BoyVac mobile web app intervention on HPV vaccine adoption outcomes via a randomized efficacy trial (BoyVac v. usual and customary care); and 3) examine the dose-response relationships between mobile web app usage and vaccine outcomes within a components analysis. A group-randomized pretest-posttest controlled design will be implemented, recruiting 1800 pairs of parents and adolescent boys from 30 pediatric clinics (n=60 parents and boys per clinic) affiliated with the Envision New Mexico, a best practices program at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center's Department of Pediatrics. Parents will be surveyed at baseline, a 3-month follow-up, and a 9-month follow-up and records HPV vaccination adoption for the boys will be obtained from the clinics' medical records at the 9- month follow-up. Analyses will test the hypotheses that 1) more 11-13 year old boys in the intervention group (BoyVac mobile web app) will adopt the HPV vaccine than boys in the usual and customary care comparison group and 2) adoption of HPV vaccine will be mediated by improvements in theoretical mediators among parents in the intervention compared to the usual and customary care comparison group. The uptake of vaccines for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in the U.S. is far below recommended levels, particularly for adolescent boys and especially among minority families. Proposed here is a mobile web application (“mobile web app”) for personal computers, smart phones, and tablet computers that will accurately inform parents and adolescent boys about the HPV vaccination and address unique concerns about its safety and effectiveness for boys. The BoyVac mobile web app will be evaluated for its ability to improve vaccine outcomes in a randomized efficacy trial with parents and adolescent boys aged 11-13 years who obtain care in pediatric
