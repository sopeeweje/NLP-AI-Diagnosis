"STROKE INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS IN A TRI-ETHNIC REGION DESCRIPTION:  Stroke remains a major public health problem with a                disproportionate impact on Blacks and Hispanics.  Studies in Northern            Manhattan have demonstrated that Blacks and Hispanics have a greater stroke      incidence and more frequently have intracranial atherosclerotic stroke than      whites.  The reasons for this race-ethnic disparity are not entirely clear.      Cross-sectional and case-control studies have identified racial-ethnic           differences in modifiable stroke risk factors, however definition of             exposures in these studies has been looked upon as prone to measurement          errors because of retrospective recall and selection biases.  The Aims of        this competitive continuation application are to evaluate the reasons for        race-ethnic differences in stroke incidence, confirm the case-control            findings of the protective effects of leisure-time physical activity,            alcohol use, and HDL-cholesterol, and test new hypotheses regarding HDL          subpopulations and homocysteine.  To accomplish these Aims a                     population-based, prospective cohort study is proposed.  Community subjects      free of stroke will be ascertained through dual frame random-digit dialing       and a cohort of 3000 White, Black and Hispanic adults over age 55 living in      the same tri-ethnic community of Northern Manhattan will be followed.            Approximately 1400 subjects will have been enrolled by the time this             application begins and another 1600 subjects will be enrolled in the first 2     years.  Socioeconomic, demographic, and risk factor data including dietary       assessments will be gathered through direct interview of the subject or          family.  At baseline, all subjects will have measurements of anthropometric      indices, blood pressure, and EKG, and blood will be drawn for total              homocysteine, related metabolites, B12, folate, creatinine, and lipid            profiles (cholesterol, LDL, triglyceride, HDL, and HDL subpopulations).          Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain            stroke, myocardial infarction, and death.  In-person assessment will be done     for all subjects with suspected outcome events and a 10% random sample of        the cohort.

"Stroke Prevention/Intervention Research Program    The objective of this proposal is to identify reasons for racial and geographic disparities related to stroke and cerebrovascular disease in the United States and to establish Prevention/Intervention programs that will reduce or eliminate these disparities. The Stroke Prevention/Intervention Research Program (SPIRP) will seek to augment and enhance the stroke research capabilities of faculty at the Morehouse School of Medicine and encourage innovative and effective research strategies to reduce the burden of stroke in populations historically at increased risk for this disease. This Program will be developed by multi-disciplinary partnerships with regional private and governmental institutions in the areas of stroke research, minority stroke research training and career development, and effective stroke prevention/intervention outreach to urban and rural African-American Communities. Collaborative stroke and cerebrovascular disease developmental research projects in community-based, clinical, and translational science will be established in the first year, along with the planning and development of the communication center that will support the educational outreach efforts of the community-based projects. Guidance on the administration, planning and evaluation of the program will be provided by the collaborative efforts of the Internal and External Advisory Committees. In addition to improving the health of the underserved, SPIRP will develop and prepare the next generation of stroke and vascular research investigators to continue this important initiative. By accomplishing each of these objectives, SPIRP will make a significant contribution to reducing the disparity in stroke incidence, and mortality, in the African-American community. The program will initially consist of five cores (Administrative, Community, Developmental, Database, and Animal Model Laboratory Cores) and three pilot projects.

"Social Determinants of Obesity and Risk of Stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States, and a leading cause of long-term disability. The risk for stroke varies by race/ethnicity; stroke incidence is greater among African Americans at younger ages, contributing to a mortality rate 80 percent greater than that of Caucasians (Keppel et al 2002; DHHS 2000; Stroke Progress Review Group, NINDS 2002). Limited understanding exists concerning the etiology and variations of subtypes of stroke incidence in different populations and geographic locations over time (Stroke Progress Review Group, NINDS 2002). Obesity, which results in part from a complex pathway of numerous lifestyle precursors, is a strong predictor of cerebrovascular disease such as stroke and other cardiovascular disease (WHO, 2000). Moreover, dietary intake and physical activity contribute to energy imbalances that result in obesity and independently predict stroke (AICR 1997; USDA/USDHHS 2000; USDHHS 1996; 2000; Krebs-Smith SM. 2001). Few studies consider both biological and social determinants of intermediate outcomes of cerebrovascular disease from a multileveled perspective. This application considers longitudinal measures of social and biological variables to investigate the independent effect of social disparities to the development of obesity among low-income multi-ethnic postpartum women at increased risk of stroke and other comorbidities. As women face particular biological and social transition during the postpartum period, the proposed research seeks to measure social determinants of pregnancy-related weight gain over time, adjusting for diet, physical and biological predictors of obesity and stroke. Research findings from the proposed work can inform the design of future interventions to reduce risk of stroke in women of reproductive age in low income, racial/ethnic subpopulations at highest risk of obesity and its sequelae. Specific aims include examination of: (1) individual and household social determinants pregnancy-related weight change and obesity; (2) social disparity in dietary intake and nutritional status and its relation to pregnancy-related weight change and obesity; and (3) neighborhood characteristics that influence the development of obesity.

"Stroke Incidence and Risk Factors in a Tri-Ethnic Region  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke remains a major public health problem with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. Studies in Northern Manhattan have demonstrated that blacks and Hispanics have a greater stroke incidence and more frequently have small vessel and intracranial atherosclerotic stroke than whites. The reasons for these race-ethnic disparities are not entirely clear. Over the last 5 years, enrollment of a population-based, prospective cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults was completed and follow-up commenced. This collaborative study is the first prospective cohort study among whites, blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community. This competitive renewal will support continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke, MI, and vascular death) and insulin resistance, carotid intima-media thickness, carotid distensibility, and quantitative MRI measures of vascular subclinical brain disease and to determine if MRI subclinical disease accounts for race ethnic differences in cognitive impairment.    To accomplish these aims further data collection using our population-based, prospective cohort study is proposed. Stored baseline serum will be used to measure fasting insulin levels to evaluate insulin resistance. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be collected at subsequent visits to expand our measurements of subclinical carotid disease to 1500 subjects. MRIs and a neuropsychological battery emphasizing frontalexecutive domains will be done on 1400 subjects and quantitative analyses performed to measure white matter hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive and a 10 percent random sample of the cohort. Community stroke surveillance will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. Specific diagnostic committees classify stroke, MI andvascular death. The strengths of this cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the triethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of putative risk factors, and the innovative assessment of MRI subclinical disease and carotid subclinical disease. This cohort study will help fill the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of stroke and cognitive impairment in minority populations and lead to new insights on innovative ways to detect those at greatest risk of the consequences of vascular disease.

"Impact of Aging on Stroke Care: A National Perspective DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Our goal is to examine the impact of aging on stroke care in the United States.  Our application proposes secondary analysis of data collected as part of the National Stroke Project.  The National Stroke Project was part of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Study (CMS) program (formerly know as the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)) to look at quality indicators for stroke care by state.  The specific aims and proposed analyses of this R03 application go beyond the analyses proposed, and funding available for, the National Stroke Project.  Our application is ideally suited to PA Number: PA-01-082 (Data analysis and Archiving in Demography, Economics, and Behavioral Research on Aging).  The R03 Award will permit an analysis of the National Stroke Project database related to measuring and understanding the age-related disparities in stroke care across the United States.  Our analyses will yield the first national picture of how age influences the care of elderly patients admitted to the hospital with stroke.  In addition, the results of this RO3 will provide new analyses critical to informing the design and content of a planned RO1 linking processes of inpatient care from the elderly patients included in the National Stroke Project with long-term outcomes.  The objective of this proposal is to provide insight into how aging influences stroke care both directly and through its association with other factors including demographics, clinical co-morbidities, hospital and physician characteristics, and geography.  These results will be critical to enhancing clinical decision-making and performance benchmarking.  Accordingly we have set specific aims: 1-to determine the influence of age on the management of acute ischemic stroke; 2-to determine if the impact of age on stroke care is different within the 'Stroke Belt'; and 3-to examine whether hospital and physician characteristics contribute to age related differences in stroke care.  Some studies have raised questions about how demographic and clinical factors contribute to the variations seen in the care and outcomes of patients with cerebro-vascular disease, but few data are available regarding how these factors specifically affect the use of specific diagnostic techniques and stroke therapies in older patients with stroke.  We hypothesize that variations in care exist by age.  Moreover, these differences in care will not be explained by differences clinical features or co-morbid conditions associated with aging.

The risk for stroke varies by race/ethnicity; stroke incidence is greater among African Americans at younger ages, contributing to a mortality rate 80 percent greater than that of Caucasians (Keppel et al 2002; DHHS 2000; Stroke Progress Review Group, NINDS 2002). Limited understanding exists concerning the etiology and variations of subtypes of stroke incidence in different populations and geographic locations over time (Stroke Progress Review Group, NINDS 2002). Obesity, which results in part from a complex pathway of numerous lifestyle precursors, is a strong predictor of cerebrovascular disease such as stroke and other cardiovascular disease (WHO, 2000). Moreover, dietary intake and physical activity contribute to energy imbalances that result in obesity and independently predict stroke (AICR 1997; USDA/USDHHS 2000; USDHHS 1996; 2000; Krebs-Smith SM. 2001). Few studies consider both biological and social determinants of intermediate outcomes of cerebrovascular disease from a multileveled perspective. This application considers longitudinal measures of social and biological variables to investigate the independent effect of social disparities to the development of obesity among low-income multi-ethnic postpartum women at increased risk of stroke and other comorbidities. As women face particular biological and social transition during the postpartum period, the proposed research seeks to measure social determinants of pregnancy-related weight gain over time, adjusting for diet, physical and biological predictors of obesity and stroke. Research findings from the proposed work can inform the design of future interventions to reduce risk of stroke in women of reproductive age in low income, racial/ethnic subpopulations at highest risk of obesity and its sequelae. Specific aims include examination of: (1) individual and household social determinants pregnancy-related weight change and obesity; (2) social disparity in dietary intake and nutritional status and its relation to pregnancy-related weight change and obesity; and (3) neighborhood characteristics that influence the development of obesity.

"Stroke Prevention/Intervention Research Program    The objective of this proposal is to identify reasons for racial and geographic disparities related to stroke and cerebrovascular disease in the United States and to establish Prevention/Intervention programs that will reduce or eliminate these disparities. The Stroke Prevention/Intervention Research Program (SPIRP) will seek to augment and enhance the stroke research capabilities of faculty at the Morehouse School of Medicine and encourage innovative and effective research strategies to reduce the burden of stroke in populations historically at increased risk for this disease. This Program will be developed by multi-disciplinary partnerships with regional private and governmental institutions in the areas of stroke research, minority stroke research training and career development, and effective stroke prevention/intervention outreach to urban and rural African-American Communities. Collaborative stroke and cerebrovascular disease developmental research projects in community-based, clinical, and translational science will be established in the first year, along with the planning and development of the communication center that will support the educational outreach efforts of the community-based projects. Guidance on the administration, planning and evaluation of the program will be provided by the collaborative efforts of the Internal and External Advisory Committees. In addition to improving the health of the underserved, SPIRP will develop and prepare the next generation of stroke and vascular research investigators to continue this important initiative. By accomplishing each of these objectives, SPIRP will make a significant contribution to reducing the disparity in stroke incidence, and mortality, in the African-American community. The program will initially consist of five cores (Administrative, Community, Developmental, Database, and Animal Model Laboratory Cores) and three pilot projects.

"Impact of Aging on Stroke Care: A National Perspective DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Our goal is to examine the impact of aging on stroke care in the United States.  Our application proposes secondary analysis of data collected as part of the National Stroke Project.  The National Stroke Project was part of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Study (CMS) program (formerly know as the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)) to look at quality indicators for stroke care by state.  The specific aims and proposed analyses of this R03 application go beyond the analyses proposed, and funding available for, the National Stroke Project.  Our application is ideally suited to PA Number: PA-01-082 (Data analysis and Archiving in Demography, Economics, and Behavioral Research on Aging).  The R03 Award will permit an analysis of the National Stroke Project database related to measuring and understanding the age-related disparities in stroke care across the United States.  Our analyses will yield the first national picture of how age influences the care of elderly patients admitted to the hospital with stroke.  In addition, the results of this RO3 will provide new analyses critical to informing the design and content of a planned RO1 linking processes of inpatient care from the elderly patients included in the National Stroke Project with long-term outcomes.  The objective of this proposal is to provide insight into how aging influences stroke care both directly and through its association with other factors including demographics, clinical co-morbidities, hospital and physician characteristics, and geography.  These results will be critical to enhancing clinical decision-making and performance benchmarking.  Accordingly we have set specific aims: 1-to determine the influence of age on the management of acute ischemic stroke; 2-to determine if the impact of age on stroke care is different within the 'Stroke Belt'; and 3-to examine whether hospital and physician characteristics contribute to age related differences in stroke care.  Some studies have raised questions about how demographic and clinical factors contribute to the variations seen in the care and outcomes of patients with cerebro-vascular disease, but few data are available regarding how these factors specifically affect the use of specific diagnostic techniques and stroke therapies in older patients with stroke.  We hypothesize that variations in care exist by age.  Moreover, these differences in care will not be explained by differences clinical features or co-morbid conditions associated with aging.

"Stroke Surveillance in a Biethnic Community DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Targeting public health intervention strategies proceeds best with a clear understanding of the burden of disease and the associated factors that mediate this disease within a population. The disease that we are studying is stroke:  the nation's number one cause of disability and third leading cause of death. The population we are studying is Mexican Americans:  the overwhelming largest component of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority population. The Brain Attack Surveillance In Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project began rigorous, population-based stroke surveillance in southeastern Texas in January 2000. Recruitment of study subjects has progressed far ahead of schedule. The tremendous collaboration among community, local Public Health Department and investigators has enabled complete ascertainment of stroke cases and detailed procedures to confirm their diagnosis.      The BASIC Project aims to provide information to the scientific and public health community regarding stroke in Mexican Americans in two complementary areas. The first objective is to provide accurate rates of transient ischemic attack, first ever and total ischemic stroke, intercerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The relative burden of these diseases in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites will be determined in the fastidious manner that can only occur in a population-based study. The second aspect of the project is to delve deeply into the relationships of access to care, acculturation, stroke risk factors and social determinants of health as these factors interact with ethnicity in their association with stroke. We are confident that our efforts in these two approaches to health disparities will yield critical information that will form a foundation for scientists in the future to reduce race/ethnic health disparities.      The Mexican American population is growing and aging quickly. The physical and emotional burden from stroke to this population will grow exponentially over the next few decades. Consequently, the economic burden for stroke will mount for all taxpayers. The BASIC Project reflects years of planning, pilot work, and now detailed, hands-on experience in fostering community relations, collaboration, data acquisition, and analysis. This project began running right out of the blocks and we are in the middle of our sprint. Renewal of this project for an additional five years will enable us to complete the mission we have begun. We will accomplish this with the highest scientific integrity and provide the rich data that people around the country who have seen our project grow have come to expect.

"Stroke Recovery in Underserved Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposed study addresses the RFA entitled ""Research on Mind-Body Interactions and Health"" (RFA #OD-03-008). Specifically, we address the National Institute on Aging interests in the study of ""the impact of optimism, happiness, or a positive attitude on well being and health; and social functioning and health."" We will do this by initiating a longitudinal study to examine how positive emotion (e.g., joy, gratitude, love, contentment) and social networks independently and interactively contribute to recovery of functional status after stroke within two underserved groups--African Americans and Hispanics. Findings will be compared with a sample of whites with stroke. Specific Aims of the proposed research are to:  1. Examine recovery of functional status (motor and cognitive function), for white, African American and Hispanic persons with stroke discharged from rehabilitation facilities;  2. Examine the contributions of positive emotion and social networks on recovery of functional status (motor and cognitive function), for white, African American, and Hispanic persons with stroke discharged from rehabilitation facilities; and  3. Examine the interaction between positive emotion and social networks on recovery of functional status (motor and cognitive function) for white, African American, and Hispanic persons with stroke discharged from rehabilitation facilities.  Persons with stroke will be recruited from 20 rehabilitation facilities across the U.S. Specific rehabilitation facilities will be targeted to assure a sample of 400 whites, 400 African Americans, and 400 Hispanics.

"Stroke Incidence and Risk Factors in a Tri-Ethnic Region  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke remains a major public health problem with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. Studies in Northern Manhattan have demonstrated that blacks and Hispanics have a greater stroke incidence and more frequently have small vessel and intracranial atherosclerotic stroke than whites. The reasons for these race-ethnic disparities are not entirely clear. Over the last 5 years, enrollment of a population-based, prospective cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults was completed and follow-up commenced. This collaborative study is the first prospective cohort study among whites, blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community. This competitive renewal will support continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke, MI, and vascular death) and insulin resistance, carotid intima-media thickness, carotid distensibility, and quantitative MRI measures of vascular subclinical brain disease and to determine if MRI subclinical disease accounts for race ethnic differences in cognitive impairment.    To accomplish these aims further data collection using our population-based, prospective cohort study is proposed. Stored baseline serum will be used to measure fasting insulin levels to evaluate insulin resistance. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be collected at subsequent visits to expand our measurements of subclinical carotid disease to 1500 subjects. MRIs and a neuropsychological battery emphasizing frontalexecutive domains will be done on 1400 subjects and quantitative analyses performed to measure white matter hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive and a 10 percent random sample of the cohort. Community stroke surveillance will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. Specific diagnostic committees classify stroke, MI andvascular death. The strengths of this cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the triethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of putative risk factors, and the innovative assessment of MRI subclinical disease and carotid subclinical disease. This cohort study will help fill the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of stroke and cognitive impairment in minority populations and lead to new insights on innovative ways to detect those at greatest risk of the consequences of vascular disease.

"REGARDS - MI Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): BACKGROUND. As for stroke, geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality are recognized but poorly understood. NIH (NINDS) supported the Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study to follow 30,000 individuals (age >44; 1/2 African American, 1/2 European American; 1/2 female; 1/2 from the stroke belt/ buckle areas) over 3.5 years for stroke incidence and mortality. SPECIFIC AIMS. The overall goal of the REGARDS-MI Ancillary Study is to capitalize on a narrow window of opportunity to leverage REGARD'S infrastructure by quantifying geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality, attack rates (new and recurrent hospitalized acute CHD and pre-hospital CHD death in the population) and case fatality (among those with an acute CHD event, death within 28 days). Our Specific Aims are to (1) estimate US geographic- and ethnic-specific rates of CHD mortality, attack rates, and case fatality; (2) study the relationship between US geographic- and ethnic-specific attack rates and variation in the prevalence of CHD risk factors; and (3) study the relationship between US geographic- and ethnic-specific CHD case fatality and socioeconomic factors, medical care and CHD risk factors. METHODS. We will retrieve medical records for all heart-related hospitalizations (about 6000) among REGARDS participants and collect data on all deaths (about 500). We will adjudicate hospitalizations and deaths for CHD, collect cardiac procedures and medications, and merge this with extensive data already being collected by REGARDS. Using multivariable multi-level analyses, we will test 10 specific hypotheses. IMPLICATIONS. This will be the first nationwide study to relate CHD attack rate and case fatality, including pre-hospital deaths, to geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality.

"Stroke Incidence and Risk Factors in a Tri-Ethnic Region  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke remains a major public health problem with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. Studies in Northern Manhattan have demonstrated that blacks and Hispanics have a greater stroke incidence and more frequently have small vessel and intracranial atherosclerotic stroke than whites. The reasons for these race-ethnic disparities are not entirely clear. Over the last 5 years, enrollment of a population-based, prospective cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults was completed and follow-up commenced. This collaborative study is the first prospective cohort study among whites, blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community. This competitive renewal will support continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke, MI, and vascular death) and insulin resistance, carotid intima-media thickness, carotid distensibility, and quantitative MRI measures of vascular subclinical brain disease and to determine if MRI subclinical disease accounts for race ethnic differences in cognitive impairment.    To accomplish these aims further data collection using our population-based, prospective cohort study is proposed. Stored baseline serum will be used to measure fasting insulin levels to evaluate insulin resistance. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be collected at subsequent visits to expand our measurements of subclinical carotid disease to 1500 subjects. MRIs and a neuropsychological battery emphasizing frontalexecutive domains will be done on 1400 subjects and quantitative analyses performed to measure white matter hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive and a 10 percent random sample of the cohort. Community stroke surveillance will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. Specific diagnostic committees classify stroke, MI andvascular death. The strengths of this cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the triethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of putative risk factors, and the innovative assessment of MRI subclinical disease and carotid subclinical disease. This cohort study will help fill the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of stroke and cognitive impairment in minority populations and lead to new insights on innovative ways to detect those at greatest risk of the consequences of vascular disease.

"Stroke Prevention/Intervention Research Program    The objective of this proposal is to identify reasons for racial and geographic disparities related to stroke and cerebrovascular disease in the United States and to establish Prevention/Intervention programs that will reduce or eliminate these disparities. The Stroke Prevention/Intervention Research Program (SPIRP) will seek to augment and enhance the stroke research capabilities of faculty at the Morehouse School of Medicine and encourage innovative and effective research strategies to reduce the burden of stroke in populations historically at increased risk for this disease. This Program will be developed by multi-disciplinary partnerships with regional private and governmental institutions in the areas of stroke research, minority stroke research training and career development, and effective stroke prevention/intervention outreach to urban and rural African-American Communities. Collaborative stroke and cerebrovascular disease developmental research projects in community-based, clinical, and translational science will be established in the first year, along with the planning and development of the communication center that will support the educational outreach efforts of the community-based projects. Guidance on the administration, planning and evaluation of the program will be provided by the collaborative efforts of the Internal and External Advisory Committees. In addition to improving the health of the underserved, SPIRP will develop and prepare the next generation of stroke and vascular research investigators to continue this important initiative. By accomplishing each of these objectives, SPIRP will make a significant contribution to reducing the disparity in stroke incidence, and mortality, in the African-American community. The program will initially consist of five cores (Administrative, Community, Developmental, Database, and Animal Model Laboratory Cores) and three pilot projects.

"Stroke Recovery in Underserved Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposed study addresses the RFA entitled ""Research on Mind-Body Interactions and Health"" (RFA #OD-03-008). Specifically, we address the National Institute on Aging interests in the study of ""the impact of optimism, happiness, or a positive attitude on well being and health; and social functioning and health."" We will do this by initiating a longitudinal study to examine how positive emotion (e.g., joy, gratitude, love, contentment) and social networks independently and interactively contribute to recovery of functional status after stroke within two underserved groups--African Americans and Hispanics. Findings will be compared with a sample of whites with stroke. Specific Aims of the proposed research are to:  1. Examine recovery of functional status (motor and cognitive function), for white, African American and Hispanic persons with stroke discharged from rehabilitation facilities;  2. Examine the contributions of positive emotion and social networks on recovery of functional status (motor and cognitive function), for white, African American, and Hispanic persons with stroke discharged from rehabilitation facilities; and  3. Examine the interaction between positive emotion and social networks on recovery of functional status (motor and cognitive function) for white, African American, and Hispanic persons with stroke discharged from rehabilitation facilities.  Persons with stroke will be recruited from 20 rehabilitation facilities across the U.S. Specific rehabilitation facilities will be targeted to assure a sample of 400 whites, 400 African Americans, and 400 Hispanics. Data will be collected by the IT Health Track at four time points: at admission and discharge from rehabilitation facility, and 80-180 days and 365-425 days after discharge.   This work is important as it begins to identify and examine factors that may contribute to a narrowing of the health disparities that currently exist between underserved minority groups (i.e., African Americans and Hispanics) and whites. This is consistent with NIH/NIA's strategic plan to ""advance aging research closer to the ultimate objectives of reducing and eliminating health disparities among older racial and ethnic minorities."" The work is also important as it has the potential to ""contribute important insights into why some do well and others do poorly in the face of persistent challenges.""

"The Effect of Socioeconomic Status on Outcome After Stroke Poverty can shorten the average person's life span by up to ten years. In the U. S., the disparity in mortality between social classes has worsened over the last 30 years. However, studies have shown that the general public fears significant disabilityafter stroke more than death, and yet the literatureregarding functional outcome after stroke is much less comprehensive. Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been shown to have a deleterious effect on functional outcome in many other disease processes. Similarly, low SES has been associated with a poorer health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in many diseases. While the HRQL has been examined in several studies regarding stroke, none to date have considered the direct impact of SES on outcome following stroke.  Thus, we have identified a significant gap in our knowledgeregarding the effect of SES on outcome and qualityof life in stroke patients. This gap in knowledge makes it difficult to interpret studies of outcome after stroke, or studies of interventions designed to improve outcome after stroke From the literature examining SES in other disease processes, we have reason to believe that socioeconomic status will have a significant impact on functional outcome and quality of life after stroke. Therefore, the next logical step is to study the impact of socioeconomicfactors on functional outcome and quality of life after stroke,  We hypothesize that having a lower SES at the time of stroke will negatively impact a stroke patient's functional outcome and HRQOL. We plan to study this question by utilizing a prospective cohort of stroke patients already being collected as part of the larger epidemiology of stroke project underway at the University of Cincinnati. We will evaluate both individual and aggregate indicators of SES, and to construct models describing the effect of these indicators on functional outcome and quality of life. We also plan to study the change over time in SES after stroke. At the completion of this study, we will have determined the effect of SES on a stroke patient's outcome and HRQOL, and will have also determined the most powerful indicators of SES to be used in future studies of SES and stroke: Given theenormous burden of stroke on our nation and the ever-rising costs of health care, the need for a specialist that canbridge the gap between stroke care and socioeconomics is evident. It is my ultimate goal to become an expert in outcomes research andthe socioeconomics of medicine, andto useclinical research to improve the lives of stroke patients from all social classes..

"Stroke Disparities Program    DESCRIPTION (abstract): Acute stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the US. A disproportionate amount of morbidity and mortality falls on underserved populations. Reduction of health disparities has become a significant public health challenge and is a major goal of the Healthy People 2010 initiative. The programmatic goal of this proposal is to identify biological and socioeconomic factors contributing to ethnic disparities and to develop innovative approaches to reduce these disparities for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Three research projects are proposed. Project 1, Acute Stroke Program of Interventions addressing Racial and Ethnic disparities (ASPIRE), is an intervention study designed to investigate whether implementation of a multilevel intervention can significantly increase the number of ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) in a predominantly underserved community. The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of all ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with IV tPA. Project 2, Preventing Recurrence of Thromboembolic Events through Coordinated Treatment in the District of Columbia (PROTECT DC) is a randomized phase II clinical trial of the PROTECT DC intervention (hospital-based initiation of aggressive secondary prevention combined with navigator case management) vs. standard management in ischemic stroke patients from two underserved hospitals in the District of Columbia. The primary aims are 1) to refine the PROTECT DC design in preparation for a phase INI trial and, 2) to assess the effect of the intervention on 4 medication goals as defined by normalization of objective measures of secondary risk factor control. Project 3, DiffErenCes in the Imaging of Primary Hemorrhage based on Ethnicity or Race (DECIPHER) is a longitudinal, MR imaging, prospective, observational, cohort study designed to evaluate the prevalence and significance by race/ethnicity of chronic cerebral microbleeds in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage. Three cores will support the projects: A) Administration B) Participant Recruitment, Retention, Intervention and Outcomes, and C) Biostatistics / Data Management. This application is designed not only to define factors leading to racial/ethnic disparities in stroke treatment and outcomes, but also to demonstrate the efficacy of programs specifically designed to reduce these disparities.      Project 1: Acute Stroke Program of Interventions Addressing Racial and Ethnic Disparities (ASPIRE)   PI: Amie Hsia      DESCRIPTION: Stroke, the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, has a disproportionate impact on underserved populations that is reflected in higher incidence and mortality rates in these groups. Several studies have suggested that blacks are less likely than whites to receive intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA), the only FDA-approved acute ischemic stroke therapy. Efforts are needed to elucidate factors contributing to racial/ethnic disparities in access to acute stroke care and to develop programs to overcome these barriers. The specific aims of this intervention project are: A) to identify previously unrecognized sociocultural and environmental barriers to acute stroke treatment in an underserved, urban population; B) to investigate whether implementation of a multilevel intervention designed to address these barriers can significantly increase the number of ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA); and C) to perform program evaluation of the methods used in the intervention to determine which efforts are the most effective. The investigators will assist each of 6 hospitals in the District of Columbia to develop a team of Stroke Champions to implement educational programs and standardized procedures designed to improve acute stroke care. Five Baltimore hospitals will serve as the control group. Essential design features of this project include: 1) a focus on underserved populations to identify community-specific barriers and then tailor existing stroke education materials to increase health literacy and decrease delays in seeking treatment; 2) implementation of interventions to address educational, attitudinal, and structural barriers at the public, paramedic and hospital levels; and 3) assignment of a dedicated research coordinator to each hospital who will also serve as a Stroke Champion. The long term objective of the trial is to identify systematic, reproducible, effective methods for improving the delivery of acute stroke therapies in underserved areas that can be implemented in a broader arena. The only way to definitively affect outcomes for underserved stroke patients is to elucidate the complex issues related to access to treatment, and the District of Columbia is the ideal city in which to perform these investigations.          ",Stroke Disparities Program,7320743,U54NS057405,[''],NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U54,2007,2135011,0.3987200996869711
"REGARDS - MI Study BACKGROUND. As for stroke, geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality are recognized but poorly understood. NIH (NINDS) funded the Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study to follow 30,000 individuals(age >44; 1/2 African American, 1/2 European American; 1/2 female; 1/2 from the stroke belt/ buckle areas) over 3.5 years for stroke incidence and mortality. SPECIFIC AIMS. The overall goal of the REGARDS-MI Ancillary Study is to capitalize on a narrow window of opportunity to leverage REGARD'S infrastructure by quantifying geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality, attack rates (new and recurrent hospitalized acute CHD and pre-hospital CHD death in the population) and case fatality (among those with an acute CHD event, death within 28 days). Our Specific Aims are to (1) estimate US geographic- and ethnic-specificrates of CHD mortality, attack rates, and case fatality; (2) study the relationshipbetween US geographic- and ethnic-specific attack rates and variation in the prevalence of CHD risk factors; and (3) study the relationship between US geographic- andethnic-specific CHD case fatality and socioeconomic factors, medical care and CHD risk factors. METHODS. We will retrieve medical records for all heart-related hospitalizations(-6000) among REGARDS participants and collect data on all deaths (-500). We will adjudicatehospitalizations and deaths for CHD, collect cardiac procedures and medications, and merge this with extensive data already being collected by REGARDS. Using multivariable multi-levelanalyses, we will test 10 specific hypotheses. IMPLICATIONS. This will be the first nationwidestudy to relate CHD attack rate and case fatality, including pre-hospital deaths, to geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality. REGARDS offers aunique opportunity to attain our specific aims without the massive participant recruitment and follow-up costs that otherwise would be necessary. There is no budgetary overlap between REGARDS and REGARDS-MI as REGARDS focuses only on potential strokes. Our results will contribute significantlyto the knowledge base essential for attaining the Healthy People 2010 goal of reducing health disparities.

"Ethnic Differences in the Risk of Fracture and Vascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The career objective of the K23 candidate is to become a rheumatic disease epidemiologist. In the context of mentored research, Dr. Curtis will examine the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes related to osteoporosis, with an emphasis on African Americans and men. To achieve this objective, Dr. Curtis has designed a didactic training program to augment his methodologic skills in analytic techniques relevant to large longitudinal studies. With supervision of experienced mentors, Dr. Curtis will obtain hands-on training in the conduct and analysis of an ancillary study to the 4 year R01 ""Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke"" study funded by the NINDS enrolling 30,000 African Americans and Caucasians. Although typically at lower risk for fractures than Caucasian women, African Americans and men suffer greater post-fracture morbidity and mortality. The ability to estimate absolute fracture risk among men and non-Caucasians is limited since these persons are relatively underrepresented in osteoporosis cohorts. Prior fracture appears to be an independent risk for subsequent stroke and myocardial infarction (Ml), but the association between bone and vascular disease in high risk, understudied populations is poorly understood. The specific aims of the K23 project are 1) Define ethnic/racial differences in relative and absolute fracture incidence over 4 years in 3 high risk groups (prevalent fracture; prior stroke; glucocorticoid use) compared to the overall cohort; 2) Determine ethnic/racial differences in stroke and Ml risk among those with prevalent fracture. Survival analysis will compare rates and risk factors for first and recurrent fractures and vascular events by ethnicity/race and gender. Shared risk factors for both bone and vascular disease will be examined in several secondary hypotheses based on an ancillary questionnaire sent to the entire cohort. Data generated from this project will provide a framework for future research proposals. Better understanding of the absolute and relative hazards associated with risk factors for fracture and associated vascular events in African Americans and men may lead to improved understanding of the underlying biology and help reduce ethnic/racial and gender-related disparities in osteoporosis care. Beyond the training objective of this award, the ultimate goal is better prevention through improved identification of those at highest risk for poor outcomes from osteoporotic fractures and associated vascular disease.             ",Ethnic Differences in the Risk of Fracture and Vascular Disease,7212577,K23AR053351,"['bisphosphonate ', ' diphosphonate ', ' biphosphonate ', ' Bisphosphonates ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' End Point ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Clinical Oncology Award ', ' Mentored Clinical Oncology Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Clinical Scientist Award ', ' Mentored Clinical Scientist Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Range ', ' Subgroup ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Adrenergic beta-Antagonists ', ' beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blockaders ', ' beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents ', ' beta blocker ', ' Adrenergic beta-Blockers ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Therapeutic Glucocorticoid ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Postmenopause ', ' postmenopausal ', ' post-menopausal ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity -

"REGARDS - MI Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): BACKGROUND. As for stroke, geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality are recognized but poorly understood. NIH (NINDS) supported the Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study to follow 30,000 individuals (age >44; 1/2 African American, 1/2 European American; 1/2 female; 1/2 from the stroke belt/ buckle areas) over 3.5 years for stroke incidence and mortality. SPECIFIC AIMS. The overall goal of the REGARDS-MI Ancillary Study is to capitalize on a narrow window of opportunity to leverage REGARD'S infrastructure by quantifying geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality, attack rates (new and recurrent hospitalized acute CHD and pre-hospital CHD death in the population) and case fatality (among those with an acute CHD event, death within 28 days). Our Specific Aims are to (1) estimate US geographic- and ethnic-specific rates of CHD mortality, attack rates, and case fatality; (2) study the relationship between US geographic- and ethnic-specific attack rates and variation in the prevalence of CHD risk factors; and (3) study the relationship between US geographic- and ethnic-specific CHD case fatality and socioeconomic factors, medical care and CHD risk factors. METHODS. We will retrieve medical records for all heart-related hospitalizations (about 6000) among REGARDS participants and collect data on all deaths (about 500). We will adjudicate hospitalizations and deaths for CHD, collect cardiac procedures and medications, and merge this with extensive data already being collected by REGARDS. Using multivariable multi-level analyses, we will test 10 specific hypotheses. IMPLICATIONS. This will be the first nationwide study to relate CHD attack rate and case fatality, including pre-hospital deaths, to geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality. REGARDS offers a unique opportunity to attain our specific aims without the massive participant recruitment and follow-up costs that otherwise would be necessary. There is no budgetary overlap between REGARDS and REGARDS-MI as REGARDS focuses only on potential strokes. Our results will contribute significantly to the knowledge base essential for attaining the Healthy People 2010 goal of reducing health disparities.         ",REGARDS - MI Study,7234357,R01HL080477,"['Case Fatality Rates ', ' Ohio ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Rivers ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' day ', ' Event ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Participant ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Prevention ', ' Cause of Death ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Sampling ', ' cost ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' heart disease risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Observational Study ', ' Rate ', ' Coronary ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Cardiac ', ' Female ', ' Geography ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Procedures ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' European ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medical Records ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mississippi ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2007,705017,0.23081850870958653
"Stroke Surveillance in a Biethnic Community DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Targeting public health intervention strategies proceeds best with a clear understanding of the burden of disease and the associated factors that mediate this disease within a population. The disease that we are studying is stroke:  the nation's number one cause of disability and third leading cause of death. The population we are studying is Mexican Americans:  the overwhelming largest component of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority population. The Brain Attack Surveillance In Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project began rigorous, population-based stroke surveillance in southeastern Texas in January 2000. Recruitment of study subjects has progressed far ahead of schedule. The tremendous collaboration among community, local Public Health Department and investigators has enabled complete ascertainment of stroke cases and detailed procedures to confirm their diagnosis.      The BASIC Project aims to provide information to the scientific and public health community regarding stroke in Mexican Americans in two complementary areas. The first objective is to provide accurate rates of transient ischemic attack, first ever and total ischemic stroke, intercerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The relative burden of these diseases in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites will be determined in the fastidious manner that can only occur in a population-based study. The second aspect of the project is to delve deeply into the relationships of access to care, acculturation, stroke risk factors and social determinants of health as these factors interact with ethnicity in their association with stroke. We are confident that our efforts in these two approaches to health disparities will yield critical information that will form a foundation for scientists in the future to reduce race/ethnic health disparities.      The Mexican American population is growing and aging quickly. The physical and emotional burden from stroke to this population will grow exponentially over the next few decades. Consequently, the economic burden for stroke will mount for all taxpayers. The BASIC Project reflects years of planning, pilot work, and now detailed, hands-on experience in fostering community relations, collaboration, data acquisition, and analysis. This project began running right out of the blocks and we are in the middle of our sprint. Renewal of this project for an additional five years will enable us to complete the mission we have begun. We will accomplish this with the highest scientific integrity and provide the rich data that people around the country who have seen our project grow have come to expect.

"Web-based stroke education for patients and families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic stroke is a major source of illness burden in the US. Stroke survivors are at high risk for recurrence and therefore they are an important group for secondary prevention. However, gaps in knowledge among stroke survivors, including inadequate knowledge of the early warning signs of stroke, inadequate understanding of the purpose and goals of rehabilitation, and lack of awareness of personal risk factors, lead to preventable stroke-related morbidity. Education to address these knowledge gaps is typically inadequate during inpatient rehabilitation for stroke. An effective program of education for stroke survivors could improve stroke outcomes by promoting rehabilitation, reducing the risk of another stroke and reducing morbidity of recurrent strokes. In the Phase I SBIR, we established the feasibility of developing a web-based education for stroke survivors and their families. We developed a prototype to impart basic knowledge about stroke, including warning signs, risk factors, and management of one of the common risk factors (hypertension). This prototype is an interactive web-based educational program, using video format and animation, as well as self-assessments and adaptive learning through computer technology to address cognitive deficits. A pilot study of this prototype with 25 stroke patients and 7 caregivers was conducted, with approximately half of the subjects using the Web-based training without adaptive learning, and the other half with adaptive learning. The program was well-accepted and stroke-related knowledge improved significantly compared to baseline for all subjects. Without the adaptive learning, the mean improvement in correct answers on pre-post testing was 2.0. When the adaptive learning component was integrated into the Web-based training, the mean improvement in correct answers on pre-post testing was 5.1. The Phase I prototype can be accessed for review at www.strokelearning.com. We now propose in Phase II to complete the development of this web-based program, so that it addresses all of the main manageable risk factors, provides general stroke knowledge, and provides an understanding of stroke rehabilitation. Importantly, this program will maintain a focus on changing patients' behavior, empowering them to reduce their risk for further strokes and benefit more optimally from rehabilitation. The program will also adapt to patients' level of knowledge and cognitive impairments. It will iteratively measure gains in knowledge by patients and caregivers and in doing so will reinforce learning over multiple sessions. As part of Phase II, we will test the efficacy of this program in improving patient and caregiver stroke knowledge at the time of discharge, and monitor change in risk- related behavior (smoking) at 2 and 6 weeks post-discharge in a controlled trial of 200 stroke patients and family members. This program will be a marketable product to providers of medical treatment for stroke, including rehabilitation hospitals which must meet specific patient education requirements, hospitals which are seeking stroke specialty certification and nursing homes. Additionally, insurance companies that wish to improve stroke prevention efforts (and thus save costs as well as improve patients' quality of care) may be a source of revenue. Stroke, the 3rd leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US afflicts between 700,000 and one million Americans annually, with African-Americans at particularly high risk. The 4.8 million stroke survivors in the US represent a large at-risk group for a recurrence of stroke. In fact, they are at 15 times greater risk of stroke compared to age-matched normals. The overall goal of this application is to develop a web-based interactive video program that would improve the education of stroke survivors and their caregivers while in rehabilitation and beyond, in order to identify personal risk factors, modify behavior, and ultimately reduce the occurrence of repeat strokes and reduction of overall stroke-related morbidity.             ",Web-based stroke education for patients and families,7479004,R44NS052948,"['prototype ', ' Computers ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Purpose ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Small Business Funding Mechanisms ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Heart ', ' Hospitals ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' stroke rehab ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Survivors ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institutes ', ' Insurance ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Fostering ', ' Self Perception ', ' self knowledge ', ' self awareness ', ' Self view ', ' Self image ', ' Personal awareness ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement (Psychology) ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Self Assessment (Psychology) ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' animation ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Week ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' American ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Certification ', ' Measures ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Cost Savings ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family member ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' stroke education ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' modifiable risk ', ' ']",NINDS,"FOX LEARNING SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2008,360254,0.44610080104255284
"REGARDS - MI Study BACKGROUND. As for stroke, geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality are recognized but poorly understood. NIH (NINDS) funded the Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study to follow 30,000 individuals(age >44; 1/2 African American, 1/2 European American; 1/2 female; 1/2 from the stroke belt/ buckle areas) over 3.5 years for stroke incidence and mortality. SPECIFIC AIMS. The overall goal of the REGARDS-MI Ancillary Study is to capitalize on a narrow window of opportunity to leverage REGARD'S infrastructure by quantifying geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality, attack rates (new and recurrent hospitalized acute CHD and pre-hospital CHD death in the population) and case fatality (among those with an acute CHD event, death within 28 days). Our Specific Aims are to (1) estimate US geographic- and ethnic-specificrates of CHD mortality, attack rates, and case fatality; (2) study the relationshipbetween US geographic- and ethnic-specific attack rates and variation in the prevalence of CHD risk factors; and (3) study the relationship between US geographic- andethnic-specific CHD case fatality and socioeconomic factors, medical care and CHD risk factors. METHODS. We will retrieve medical records for all heart-related hospitalizations(-6000) among REGARDS participants and collect data on all deaths (-500). We will adjudicatehospitalizations and deaths for CHD, collect cardiac procedures and medications, and merge this with extensive data already being collected by REGARDS. Using multivariable multi-levelanalyses, we will test 10 specific hypotheses. IMPLICATIONS. This will be the first nationwidestudy to relate CHD attack rate and case fatality, including pre-hospital deaths, to geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality. REGARDS offers aunique opportunity to attain our specific aims without the massive participant recruitment and follow-up costs that otherwise would be necessary. There is no budgetary overlap between REGARDS and REGARDS-MI as REGARDS focuses only on potential strokes. Our results will contribute significantlyto the knowledge base essential for attaining the Healthy People 2010 goal of reducing health disparities.

"Home-Based Automated Therapy of Arm Function After Stroke Via Tele-Rehabilitation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Constraint-Induced Movement therapy (CIMT) is one of few techniques that has been shown in controlled studies to produce large improvements in real-world arm function in stroke survivors with mild to moderate hemiparesis. The standard treatment involves one-on-one training of paretic arm use in the clinic for 3 hr/day for 10 consecutive weekdays and placing a mitt on the other hand to discourage its use. The considerable cost of CIMT, due to the demand on therapist time and requirement that patients travel daily to a clinic for 2 weeks, imposes substantial limits on those who might access the therapy. Our lab, with Peter Lum, Ph.D., has developed a device for automating the delivery of CIMT named AutoCITE; it permits practice of 8 upper- extremity tasks and provides frequent graphical performance feedback. Two reports indicate that AutoCITE is as efficacious as standard CIMT even with therapist effort reduced by 75%. A third report suggests that AutoCITE under simulated telerehabilitation conditions (i.e., patient and therapist were in different rooms in the lab) is also just as efficacious. We propose to modify AutoCITE so that it is more appropriate for use in patients' homes and evaluate its efficacy for providing CIMT on a telerehab basis. We will also specifically test whether making the AutoCITE software more interactive helps patients to comply with training at home, where there are more distractions. To this end, we will randomize 87 chronic stroke survivors to: 1. AutoCITE training in the home with two patients supervised concurrently by one therapist remotely via an Internet-based audio- visual link, 2. the same procedures except that the more interactive software will be run on AutoCITE, and 3. dose-matched, standard CIMT in the home. Motor outcomes and costs from the home-based, two-on-one, tele-AutoCITE groups will be compared to those from the home-based, one-on-one, in vivo CIMT group and to those from laboratory-based AutoCITE and standard CIMT groups run previously. If successful, AutoCITE, which involves simply automating task practice with actual objects and is much less expensive than prevailing virtual reality based approaches, might serve as a platform for delivering other upper-extremity therapies, in addition to CIMT, via telerehab. With about 300,000 new stroke survivors suffering motor disability annually, cutting the cost of and increasing access to efficacious upper-extremity rehabilitation has the potential to reduce disability significantly.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Our laboratory, in collaboration with Peter Lum, Ph.D., has developed a device for automating the delivery of Constraint-Induced Movement therapy (CI therapy) named AutoCITE; it permits practice of 8 upper-extremity tasks and provides frequent graphical performance feedback. Two recently published studies suggest that AutoCITE is as efficacious as one-one-one CI therapy. Our proposed study will test the efficacy of the AutoCITE device to provide CI therapy on a tele-rehabilitation basis in patients' home. There are approximately 300,000 new strokes survivors with residual motor disability annually. Reducing the cost of and increasing access to efficacious upper-extremity rehabilitation has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of stroke on patients, their families and the healthcare system.       ",Home-Based Automated Therapy of Arm Function After Stroke Via Tele-Rehabilitation,7467881,R01HD053750,"['Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Membrum superius ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' distraction ', ' Electronics ', ' Dose ', ' Equipment ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Motor ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Text ', ' Limb structure ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Procedures ', ' Hand ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hemipareses ', ' hemiparetic ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Laboratories ', ' disability ', ' handicapping condition ', ' handicapping ', ' Infirmity ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Collaborations ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Simulate ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Daily ', ' Shapes ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Condition ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Running ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Automation ', ' Hour ', ' day ', ' Week ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Upper arm ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' motor deficit ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' virtual reality ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Accounting ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' chronic stroke ', ' constraint induced movement therapy ', ' prototype ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2008,286968,0.2006927253836023
"Stroke Disparities Program    DESCRIPTION (abstract): Acute stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the US. A disproportionate amount of morbidity and mortality falls on underserved populations. Reduction of health disparities has become a significant public health challenge and is a major goal of the Healthy People 2010 initiative. The programmatic goal of this proposal is to identify biological and socioeconomic factors contributing to ethnic disparities and to develop innovative approaches to reduce these disparities for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Three research projects are proposed. Project 1, Acute Stroke Program of Interventions addressing Racial and Ethnic disparities (ASPIRE), is an intervention study designed to investigate whether implementation of a multilevel intervention can significantly increase the number of ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) in a predominantly underserved community. The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of all ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with IV tPA. Project 2, Preventing Recurrence of Thromboembolic Events through Coordinated Treatment in the District of Columbia (PROTECT DC) is a randomized phase II clinical trial of the PROTECT DC intervention (hospital-based initiation of aggressive secondary prevention combined with navigator case management) vs. standard management in ischemic stroke patients from two underserved hospitals in the District of Columbia. The primary aims are 1) to refine the PROTECT DC design in preparation for a phase INI trial and, 2) to assess the effect of the intervention on 4 medication goals as defined by normalization of objective measures of secondary risk factor control. Project 3, DiffErenCes in the Imaging of Primary Hemorrhage based on Ethnicity or Race (DECIPHER) is a longitudinal, MR imaging, prospective, observational, cohort study designed to evaluate the prevalence and significance by race/ethnicity of chronic cerebral microbleeds in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage. Three cores will support the projects: A) Administration B) Participant Recruitment, Retention, Intervention and Outcomes, and C) Biostatistics / Data Management. This application is designed not only to define factors leading to racial/ethnic disparities in stroke treatment and outcomes, but also to demonstrate the efficacy of programs specifically designed to reduce these disparities.      Project 1: Acute Stroke Program of Interventions Addressing Racial and Ethnic Disparities (ASPIRE)   PI: Amie Hsia      DESCRIPTION: Stroke, the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, has a disproportionate impact on underserved populations that is reflected in higher incidence and mortality rates in these groups. Several studies have suggested that blacks are less likely than whites to receive intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA), the only FDA-approved acute ischemic stroke therapy. Efforts are needed to elucidate factors contributing to racial/ethnic disparities in access to acute stroke care and to develop programs to overcome these barriers. The specific aims of this intervention project are: A) to identify previously unrecognized sociocultural and environmental barriers to acute stroke treatment in an underserved, urban population; B) to investigate whether implementation of a multilevel intervention designed to address these barriers can significantly increase the number of ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA); and C) to perform program evaluation of the methods used in the intervention to determine which efforts are the most effective. The investigators will assist each of 6 hospitals in the District of Columbia to develop a team of Stroke Champions to implement educational programs and standardized procedures designed to improve acute stroke care. Five Baltimore hospitals will serve as the control group. Essential design features of this project include: 1) a focus on underserved populations to identify community-specific barriers and then tailor existing stroke education materials to increase health literacy and decrease delays in seeking treatment; 2) implementation of interventions to address educational, attitudinal, and structural barriers at the public, paramedic and hospital levels; and 3) assignment of a dedicated research coordinator to each hospital who will also serve as a Stroke Champion. The long term objective of the trial is to identify systematic, reproducible, effective methods for improving the delivery of acute stroke therapies in underserved areas that can be implemented in a broader arena. The only way to definitively affect outcomes for underserved stroke patients is to elucidate the complex issues related to access to treatment, and the District of Columbia is the ideal city in which to perform these investigations.          ",Stroke Disparities Program,7501923,U54NS057405,[''],NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U54,2008,2808973,0.3987200996869711
"Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Geographic and racial disparities in stroke mortality have existed for over 50 years with an incremental annual cost of $4.6 billion. Many causes for these disparities have been proposed, but existing research has inadequately addressed these, and interventions have failed to reduce their magnitude. Further, national data are not available describing the prevalence of cognitive decline, a problem largely caused by cerebrovascular disease and its risk factors. With completion of recruitment, baseline evaluation and follow-up of a national cohort of 30,000 black and white community dwelling participants, the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study is uniquely positioned to test older but unsubstantiated hypotheses explaining race/region disparities, to assess new evidence-based hypotheses, and to provide the first national data on predictors of cognitive decline. In this continuation application we propose to continue follow-up for incident stroke and cognitive decline among this cohort, which will quadruple the number of observed stroke events arid provide longitudinal data on cognitive decline. These data will provide the opportunity to investigate the underlying causes of the disparities in stroke mortality by assessing the role of confounding factors to mediate the observed excess risk among African Americans and Southerners, and to develop risk functions for relatively rare stroke subtypes including ICH and SAH. Preliminary analysis from REGARDS suggests that there is a-""cognitive decline belt"" that is concordant with the Stroke belt. The data from the continuation will allow a refinement of the description of these disparities, and, using similar analysis approaches employed for the stroke outcomes, will provide insights into the causes for these disparities. Finally, we will investigate the role of cognitive decline as a predictor for subsequent stroke events. Completion of these aims will allow for development of interventions to eliminate disparities in the incidence of stroke and cognitive decline. Implementation of specific interventions customized for black and white populations, and by region of the United States, may reduce health disparities in stroke recognition and treatment, risk factor prevention, and optimal management of existing risk factors.           ",Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke,7382854,U01NS041588,[''],NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2008,4268188,0.31657242720705664
"Stroke Surveillance in a Biethnic Community DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Targeting public health intervention strategies proceeds best with a clear understanding of the burden of disease and the associated factors that mediate this disease within a population. The disease that we are studying is stroke:  the nation's number one cause of disability and third leading cause of death. The population we are studying is Mexican Americans:  the overwhelming largest component of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority population. The Brain Attack Surveillance In Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project began rigorous, population-based stroke surveillance in southeastern Texas in January 2000. Recruitment of study subjects has progressed far ahead of schedule. The tremendous collaboration among community, local Public Health Department and investigators has enabled complete ascertainment of stroke cases and detailed procedures to confirm their diagnosis.      The BASIC Project aims to provide information to the scientific and public health community regarding stroke in Mexican Americans in two complementary areas. The first objective is to provide accurate rates of transient ischemic attack, first ever and total ischemic stroke, intercerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The relative burden of these diseases in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites will be determined in the fastidious manner that can only occur in a population-based study. The second aspect of the project is to delve deeply into the relationships of access to care, acculturation, stroke risk factors and social determinants of health as these factors interact with ethnicity in their association with stroke. We are confident that our efforts in these two approaches to health disparities will yield critical information that will form a foundation for scientists in the future to reduce race/ethnic health disparities.      The Mexican American population is growing and aging quickly. The physical and emotional burden from stroke to this population will grow exponentially over the next few decades. Consequently, the economic burden for stroke will mount for all taxpayers. The BASIC Project reflects years of planning, pilot work, and now detailed, hands-on experience in fostering community relations, collaboration, data acquisition, and analysis. This project began running right out of the blocks and we are in the middle of our sprint. Renewal of this project for an additional five years will enable us to complete the mission we have begun.

"Ethnic Differences in the Risk of Fracture and Vascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The career objective of the K23 candidate is to become a rheumatic disease epidemiologist. In the context of mentored research, Dr. Curtis will examine the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes related to osteoporosis, with an emphasis on African Americans and men. To achieve this objective, Dr. Curtis has designed a didactic training program to augment his methodologic skills in analytic techniques relevant to large longitudinal studies. With supervision of experienced mentors, Dr. Curtis will obtain hands-on training in the conduct and analysis of an ancillary study to the 4 year R01 ""Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke"" study funded by the NINDS enrolling 30,000 African Americans and Caucasians. Although typically at lower risk for fractures than Caucasian women, African Americans and men suffer greater post-fracture morbidity and mortality. The ability to estimate absolute fracture risk among men and non-Caucasians is limited since these persons are relatively underrepresented in osteoporosis cohorts. Prior fracture appears to be an independent risk for subsequent stroke and myocardial infarction (Ml), but the association between bone and vascular disease in high risk, understudied populations is poorly understood. The specific aims of the K23 project are 1) Define ethnic/racial differences in relative and absolute fracture incidence over 4 years in 3 high risk groups (prevalent fracture; prior stroke; glucocorticoid use) compared to the overall cohort; 2) Determine ethnic/racial differences in stroke and Ml risk among those with prevalent fracture. Survival analysis will compare rates and risk factors for first and recurrent fractures and vascular events by ethnicity/race and gender. Shared risk factors for both bone and vascular disease will be examined in several secondary hypotheses based on an ancillary questionnaire sent to the entire cohort. Data generated from this project will provide a framework for future research proposals. Better understanding of the absolute and relative hazards associated with risk factors for fracture and associated vascular events in African Americans and men may lead to improved understanding of the underlying biology and help reduce ethnic/racial and gender-related disparities in osteoporosis care. Beyond the training objective of this award, the ultimate goal is better prevention through improved identification of those at highest risk for poor outcomes from osteoporotic fractures and associated vascular disease.             ",Ethnic Differences in the Risk of Fracture and Vascular Disease,7426939,K23AR053351,"['career ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Postmenopause ', ' postmenopausal ', ' post-menopausal ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity -

"Stroke Incidence and Risk Factors in a Tri-Ethnic Region    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke and cognitive impairment remain a major public health problem with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. The reasons for these race-ethnic disparities are not entirely clear. Improved detection and control of novel stroke risk factors are needed to reduce vascular disease burden. The Northern Manhattan prospective cohort consists of a population-based cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults enrolled since 2001 who have been followed annually for stroke, MI, and death. This collaborative study now involves faculty across 2 academic institutions and is the first prospective cohort study among whites, blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community. Over the last 5 years, the aims have expanded to include subclinical carotid, cardiac, and brain measures. High-resolution carotid imaging data has been assembled on 1770 subjects and a neuropsychological battery and standardized brain MRI will be completed on 1300 subjects with quantitative analyses to measure white matter hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds. This grant supports continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke, MI, and vascular death) and adiponectin, a new marker of obesity, new measures of subclinical carotid disease (carotid plaque area and densitometry), and quantitative MRI measures of vascular subclinical brain disease, as well as evaluate the impact on cognitive decline. To accomplish these aims, stored baseline plasma will be used to measure fasting adiponectin levels. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be quantitatively analyzed from standardized digital recordings. Repeat neuro-psychological testing emphasizing frontal-executive domains will be done on 1105 subjects. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive for any vascular event. Community stroke surveillance will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. The strengths of this cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of traditional and emerging risk factors, and the innovative assessment of MRI subclinical disease and carotid subclinical disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and coronary heart disease comprise two of the top three leading causes of death in the US and are of increasing importance in developing countries. While heart disease is the leading cause of death, stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. Stroke continues to have a disproportionate impact on mortality for blacks compared to whites. The aging and rapid growth of the black and Hispanic population has the potential to lead to future increases in the public health impact of stroke and vascular disease. The economic burden in the US due to stroke among Hispanics and blacks from 2005 to 2050 is projected to be $313 billion for Hispanics, and $379 billion for blacks.       Race-ethnic disparities are driven by differences in stroke incidence and vascular risk factors and have remained significant even after accounting for differences in socioeconomic status. Healthy People 2010 called for an elimination of race-ethnic disparities, but did not provide a clear method to achieve this lofty goal.       The principal goals of our study are to help fill the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of stroke and vascular disease particularly among blacks and Hispanics in order to improve future prevention efforts. We have broadened our focus to investigate markers of obesity, subclinical disease measures of the carotid arteries and brain, and predictors of vascular cognitive impairment and decline. We need to understand the importance of these conditions in predicting stroke, MI, vascular death, and determining cognitive decline among minority populations.             ",Stroke Incidence and

"The Effect of Socioeconomic Status on Outcome After Stroke Poverty can shorten the average person's life span by up to ten years. In the U. S., the disparity in mortality between social classes has worsened over the last 30 years. However, studies have shown that the general public fears significant disabilityafter stroke more than death, and yet the literatureregarding functional outcome after stroke is much less comprehensive. Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been shown to have a deleterious effect on functional outcome in many other disease processes. Similarly, low SES has been associated with a poorer health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in many diseases. While the HRQL has been examined in several studies regarding stroke, none to date have considered the direct impact of SES on outcome following stroke.  Thus, we have identified a significant gap in our knowledgeregarding the effect of SES on outcome and qualityof life in stroke patients. This gap in knowledge makes it difficult to interpret studies of outcome after stroke, or studies of interventions designed to improve outcome after stroke From the literature examining SES in other disease processes, we have reason to believe that socioeconomic status will have a significant impact on functional outcome and quality of life after stroke. Therefore, the next logical step is to study the impact of socioeconomicfactors on functional outcome and quality of life after stroke,  We hypothesize that having a lower SES at the time of stroke will negatively impact a stroke patient's functional outcome and HRQOL. We plan to study this question by utilizing a prospective cohort of stroke patients already being collected as part of the larger epidemiology of stroke project underway at the University of Cincinnati. We will evaluate both individual and aggregate indicators of SES, and to construct models describing the effect of these indicators on functional outcome and quality of life. We also plan to study the change over time in SES after stroke. At the completion of this study, we will have determined the effect of SES on a stroke patient's outcome and HRQOL, and will have also determined the most powerful indicators of SES to be used in future studies of SES and stroke: Given theenormous burden of stroke on our nation and the ever-rising costs of health care, the need for a specialist that canbridge the gap between stroke care and socioeconomics is evident. It is my ultimate goal to become an expert in outcomes research andthe socioeconomics of medicine, andto useclinical research to improve the lives of stroke patients from all social classes..

"Stroke Disparities Program    DESCRIPTION (abstract): Acute stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the US. A disproportionate amount of morbidity and mortality falls on underserved populations. Reduction of health disparities has become a significant public health challenge and is a major goal of the Healthy People 2010 initiative. The programmatic goal of this proposal is to identify biological and socioeconomic factors contributing to ethnic disparities and to develop innovative approaches to reduce these disparities for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Three research projects are proposed. Project 1, Acute Stroke Program of Interventions addressing Racial and Ethnic disparities (ASPIRE), is an intervention study designed to investigate whether implementation of a multilevel intervention can significantly increase the number of ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) in a predominantly underserved community. The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of all ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with IV tPA. Project 2, Preventing Recurrence of Thromboembolic Events through Coordinated Treatment in the District of Columbia (PROTECT DC) is a randomized phase II clinical trial of the PROTECT DC intervention (hospital-based initiation of aggressive secondary prevention combined with navigator case management) vs. standard management in ischemic stroke patients from two underserved hospitals in the District of Columbia. The primary aims are 1) to refine the PROTECT DC design in preparation for a phase INI trial and, 2) to assess the effect of the intervention on 4 medication goals as defined by normalization of objective measures of secondary risk factor control. Project 3, DiffErenCes in the Imaging of Primary Hemorrhage based on Ethnicity or Race (DECIPHER) is a longitudinal, MR imaging, prospective, observational, cohort study designed to evaluate the prevalence and significance by race/ethnicity of chronic cerebral microbleeds in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage. Three cores will support the projects: A) Administration B) Participant Recruitment, Retention, Intervention and Outcomes, and C) Biostatistics / Data Management. This application is designed not only to define factors leading to racial/ethnic disparities in stroke treatment and outcomes, but also to demonstrate the efficacy of programs specifically designed to reduce these disparities.      Project 1: Acute Stroke Program of Interventions Addressing Racial and Ethnic Disparities (ASPIRE)   PI: Amie Hsia      DESCRIPTION: Stroke, the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, has a disproportionate impact on underserved populations that is reflected in higher incidence and mortality rates in these groups. Several studies have suggested that blacks are less likely than whites to receive intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA), the only FDA-approved acute ischemic stroke therapy. Efforts are needed to elucidate factors contributing to racial/ethnic disparities in access to acute stroke care and to develop programs to overcome these barriers. The specific aims of this intervention project are: A) to identify previously unrecognized sociocultural and environmental barriers to acute stroke treatment in an underserved, urban population; B) to investigate whether implementation of a multilevel intervention designed to address these barriers can significantly increase the number of ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA); and C) to perform program evaluation of the methods used in the intervention to determine which efforts are the most effective. The investigators will assist each of 6 hospitals in the District of Columbia to develop a team of Stroke Champions to implement educational programs and standardized procedures designed to improve acute stroke care. Five Baltimore hospitals will serve as the control group. Essential design features of this project include: 1) a focus on underserved populations to identify community-specific barriers and then tailor existing stroke education materials to increase health literacy and decrease delays in seeking treatment; 2) implementation of interventions to address educational, attitudinal, and structural barriers at the public, paramedic and hospital levels; and 3) assignment of a dedicated research coordinator to each hospital who will also serve as a Stroke Champion. The long term objective of the trial is to identify systematic, reproducible, effective methods for improving the delivery of acute stroke therapies in underserved areas that can be implemented in a broader arena. The only way to definitively affect outcomes for underserved stroke patients is to elucidate the complex issues related to access to treatment, and the District of Columbia is the ideal city in which to perform these investigations.          ",Stroke Disparities Program,7912354,U54NS057405,[''],NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U54,2009,242939,0.3987200996869711

"Stroke Recovery in Underserved Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposed study addresses the RFA entitled ""Research on Mind-Body Interactions and Health"" (RFA #OD-03-008). Specifically, we address the National Institute on Aging interests in the study of ""the impact of optimism, happiness, or a positive attitude on well being and health; and social functioning and health."" We will do this by initiating a longitudinal study to examine how positive emotion (e.g., joy, gratitude, love, contentment) and social networks independently and interactively contribute to recovery of functional status after stroke within two underserved groups--African Americans and Hispanics. Findings will be compared with a sample of whites with stroke. Specific Aims of the proposed research are to:  1. Examine recovery of functional status (motor and cognitive function), for white, African American and Hispanic persons with stroke discharged from rehabilitation facilities;  2. Examine the contributions of positive emotion and social networks on recovery of functional status (motor and cognitive function), for white, African American, and Hispanic persons with stroke discharged from rehabilitation facilities; and  3. Examine the interaction between positive emotion and social networks on recovery of functional status (motor and cognitive function) for white, African American, and Hispanic persons with stroke discharged from rehabilitation facilities.  Persons with stroke will be recruited from 20 rehabilitation facilities across the U.S. Specific rehabilitation facilities will be targeted to assure a sample of 400 whites, 400 African Americans, and 400 Hispanics. Data will be collected by the IT Health Track at four time points: at admission and discharge from rehabilitation facility, and 80-180 days and 365-425 days after discharge.   This work is important as it begins to identify and examine factors that may contribute to a narrowing of the health disparities that currently exist between underserved minority groups (i.e., African Americans and Hispanics) and whites. This is consistent with NIH/NIA's strategic plan to ""advance aging research closer to the ultimate objectives of reducing and eliminating health disparities among older racial and ethnic minorities.""

"Racial & Ethnic Disparities in Incidence and Inpatient Outcomes of Acute Stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most of the current literature on racial and ethnic disparities in stroke comes from comparing whites with minorities. To identify key modifiable factors underlying these disparities, we propose an alternative approach that follows from recognizing that there is immense diversity in stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) incidence and outcomes within each racial and ethnic subpopulation. Factors underlying higher incidence or worse outcomes for blacks may be different than those for Hispanics. As a preliminary demonstration, we examined incidence of acute ischemic stroke using data of all inpatient admissions in New Jersey and Arizona (2002-2004). Non- Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics were each stratified into three income categories - lower, middle and higher; age-sex adjusted acute stroke incidence rates were obtained for each cohort. A remarkably puzzling - and to the best of our knowledge previously unreported, finding is that in both the states, the stroke rate for Hispanics was systematically higher for higher income groups. In contrast, the income gradients for blacks and whites were downward sloping. The usefulness of this approach is immediately apparent. In New Jersey and Arizona, the excess stroke rate (relative to same-income whites) for Hispanics is 25 percent for lower income cohort but 200 percent for higher income cohort. Therefore higher incidence risk among Hispanics may be less due to SES-related potential factors (limited insurance, low income, public assistance, physician supply) and more due to potential factors such as physiological risk factors (diabetes, obesity, hypertension), health behavior (smoking, exercise), risk awareness, geographic location and provider-related characteristics. Limiting analysis to each racial/ethnic subgroup, our objective is to identify and assess which potential factors influence ""excess"" risk of stroke incidence and adverse hospital outcomes for the three racial and ethnic subpopulations. We propose to use data on all inpatient discharges during 2005-2007 from nine states (AZ, CA, FL, MA, NJ, NY, PA, SC and TX), with sizable minority populations. Incidence rates will be obtained by combining Census populations of each cohort. Hierarchical multivariate regression models negative binomial, logistic and linear, will be used to estimate the influence of each potential factor. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reductions in stroke incidence and advancements in care for acute stroke have been instrumental in the steady declines in stroke mortality since the 1960s. One concern in recent years is that this decline has leveled. A second concern is that these gains have been disproportionately distributed across race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. For effective targeting of interventions and public policy, our study aims to use evidence to identify and prioritize modifiable factors appropriate for each minority cohort.           Project Narrative Reductions in stroke incidence and advancements in care for acute stroke have been instrumental in the steady declines in stroke mortality since the 1960s.

"Development of a Cardiovascular Surveillance System in the CVRN    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will establish a surveillance system for cardiovascular disease in approximately 11 million health maintenance organization (HMO) members. The surveillance system will be initially established for coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure (HF), and stroke. The broad goals of this project are to:  1. Establish a surveillance system for coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure (HF) and stroke in the 15 centers of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) funded Cardiovascular Disease Research Network including therapeutic interventions, post-event outcomes and important risk factors and confounders.  2. Work collaboratively to establish and implement an aggregate database incorporating coronary  heart disease CHD, HF, and stroke data from all 15 CVRN sites that can be used by CVRN  investigators and other qualified research scientists to conduct studies related to comparative  effectiveness and health disparities.  3. Identify standard criteria for coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke clinical outcomes, as well as all components noted in goal #1 to enable data aggregation 4. Determine the most recent 10-year trends in the rates of acute myocardial infarction and stroke hospitalization and their relationship to trends in risk factors, co-morbidities, therapeutic  interventions, medications, and diagnostic modalities.  5. Demonstrate that the data can be used to address research questions regarding comparative effectiveness and novel methods of monitoring health disparities, areas that have been identified as RC2 topics by NHLBI. This project will result in a surveillance system in a consortium of 15 geographically diverse health plans that provide health care to about 11 million people, nearly 4% of the U.S. population. This surveillance system will be significantly larger than other existing cardiovascular surveillance efforts in the U.S. and includes a population that is diverse in race/ethnicity and sociodemographic characteristics. The surveillance system will include for CHD, HF, and stroke electronically available data on risk factors, co-morbidities, prescription medications, therapeutic interventions, and laboratory testing, and physician and patient characteristics. These data can be utilized to provide timely surveillance reports for CHD, CF, and stroke; a comprehensive description of a patient's longitudinal course both prior to and subsequent to development of CHD, CF, and stroke; and enable research questions to be addressed that assess the relationship of these variables to the course of disease as well as to address research questions relating to comparative effectiveness and to disparities in medical treatment and outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will establish a large database of information about heart disease and stroke in about 11 million members of 15 HMO providers of comprehensive medical care.

"Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Geographic and racial disparities in stroke mortality have existed for over 50 years with an incremental annual cost of $4.6 billion. Many causes for these disparities have been proposed, but existing research has inadequately addressed these, and interventions have failed to reduce their magnitude. Further, national data are not available describing the prevalence of cognitive decline, a problem largely caused by cerebrovascular disease and its risk factors. With completion of recruitment, baseline evaluation and follow-up of a national cohort of 30,000 black and white community dwelling participants, the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study is uniquely positioned to test older but unsubstantiated hypotheses explaining race/region disparities, to assess new evidence-based hypotheses, and to provide the first national data on predictors of cognitive decline. In this continuation application we propose to continue follow-up for incident stroke and cognitive decline among this cohort, which will quadruple the number of observed stroke events arid provide longitudinal data on cognitive decline. These data will provide the opportunity to investigate the underlying causes of the disparities in stroke mortality by assessing the role of confounding factors to mediate the observed excess risk among African Americans and Southerners, and to develop risk functions for relatively rare stroke subtypes including ICH and SAH. Preliminary analysis from REGARDS suggests that there is a-""cognitive decline belt"" that is concordant with the Stroke belt. The data from the continuation will allow a refinement of the description of these disparities, and, using similar analysis approaches employed for the stroke outcomes, will provide insights into the causes for these disparities. Finally, we will investigate the role of cognitive decline as a predictor for subsequent stroke events. Completion of these aims will allow for development of interventions to eliminate disparities in the incidence of stroke and cognitive decline. Implementation of specific interventions customized for black and white populations, and by region of the United States, may reduce health disparities in stroke recognition and treatment, risk factor prevention, and optimal management of existing risk factors.           ",Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke,7591689,U01NS041588,"['geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cognitive ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Alabama ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' infarct ', ' Infarction ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Insulin (ox), 8A-L-threonine-10A-L-isoleucine-30B-L-threonine- ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Laboratories ', ' insight ', ' Louisiana ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Mississippi ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' North Carolina ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' programs ', ' South Carolina ', ' Arkansas ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' SAH ', ' Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ', ' cognitive function ', ' Tennessee ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' vasculopathy ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Brain Infarction ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement 1s ', ' Complement 1 Esterase ', ' C1s ', ' C1 s ', ' C1 Esterase ', ' C 1 Esterase ', ' Complement component C1s ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' evidence base ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2009,4306994,0.31657242720705664
"Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to continue our population-based study of stroke incidence, risk factors, treatment, and outcome of stroke within our biracial metropolitan population of 1,349,351, of whom 215,611 (15%) are of black race (US Census 2000). We have studied trends in stroke incidence and case fatality, as well as the prevalence of risk factors and knowledge of stroke (via a population survey) for almost 15 years and have demonstrated a racial disparity where stroke incidence in African-Americans is more than double that of whites. In addition to continuing these important activities, we propose an innovative pilot study that will be the largest prospective, population-based stroke outcomes study to date. The anticipated ~3,200 patients with strokes and 800 TIAs from our region in 2010, as well as the 2,000 surveyed participants, will be used to test the following hypotheses: 1. Temporal trends in the incidence rate of stroke will demonstrate a decrease over time in whites (as shown by our 2005 preliminary data). However, there will not be a similar decrease among blacks, a racial group that has not been examined in other temporal studies of stroke. We expect that case fatality rates will not change between periods, and will be similar for both blacks and whites. 2. A cohort of subjects followed by a regional HIE combined with phone-call follow-up will be more representative of the entire stroke population in our region than a cohort of subjects that agree to in-person interviews, which is likely to have participation and survival biases. Information obtained via this approach will be as valid as data from manual chart abstraction and direct interview for determining access to care and individual patients' functional outcome after stroke across a region, and will be more efficient to collect than that obtained via manual processes. 3. The proportion of the population that knows warning signs or risk factors for stroke will NOT improve between 2006 and 2011, based on our preliminary data. When subjects are asked about their own personal risk for stroke, a lower self-perceived risk will be associated with worse stroke knowledge. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The change in stroke occurrence over time is the ultimate test of how well science has translated new discoveries into benefits for the population. Our study has examined racial disparities in stroke over the last 15 years, showing that blacks have higher risk for stroke than whites.

"Home-Based Automated Therapy of Arm Function After Stroke Via Tele-Rehabilitation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Constraint-Induced Movement therapy (CIMT) is one of few techniques that has been shown in controlled studies to produce large improvements in real-world arm function in stroke survivors with mild to moderate hemiparesis. The standard treatment involves one-on-one training of paretic arm use in the clinic for 3 hr/day for 10 consecutive weekdays and placing a mitt on the other hand to discourage its use. The considerable cost of CIMT, due to the demand on therapist time and requirement that patients travel daily to a clinic for 2 weeks, imposes substantial limits on those who might access the therapy. Our lab, with Peter Lum, Ph.D., has developed a device for automating the delivery of CIMT named AutoCITE; it permits practice of 8 upper- extremity tasks and provides frequent graphical performance feedback. Two reports indicate that AutoCITE is as efficacious as standard CIMT even with therapist effort reduced by 75%. A third report suggests that AutoCITE under simulated telerehabilitation conditions (i.e., patient and therapist were in different rooms in the lab) is also just as efficacious. We propose to modify AutoCITE so that it is more appropriate for use in patients' homes and evaluate its efficacy for providing CIMT on a telerehab basis. We will also specifically test whether making the AutoCITE software more interactive helps patients to comply with training at home, where there are more distractions. To this end, we will randomize 87 chronic stroke survivors to: 1. AutoCITE training in the home with two patients supervised concurrently by one therapist remotely via an Internet-based audio- visual link, 2. the same procedures except that the more interactive software will be run on AutoCITE, and 3. dose-matched, standard CIMT in the home. Motor outcomes and costs from the home-based, two-on-one, tele-AutoCITE groups will be compared to those from the home-based, one-on-one, in vivo CIMT group and to those from laboratory-based AutoCITE and standard CIMT groups run previously. If successful, AutoCITE, which involves simply automating task practice with actual objects and is much less expensive than prevailing virtual reality based approaches, might serve as a platform for delivering other upper-extremity therapies, in addition to CIMT, via telerehab. With about 300,000 new stroke survivors suffering motor disability annually, cutting the cost of and increasing access to efficacious upper-extremity rehabilitation has the potential to reduce disability significantly.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Our laboratory, in collaboration with Peter Lum, Ph.D., has developed a device for automating the delivery of Constraint-Induced Movement therapy (CI therapy) named AutoCITE; it permits practice of 8 upper-extremity tasks and provides frequent graphical performance feedback. Two recently published studies suggest that AutoCITE is as efficacious as one-one-one CI therapy. Our proposed study will test the efficacy of the AutoCITE device to provide CI therapy on a tele-rehabilitation basis in patients' home. There are approximately 300,000 new strokes survivors with residual motor disability annually. Reducing the cost of and increasing access to efficacious upper-extremity rehabilitation has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of stroke on patients, their families and the healthcare system.       ",Home-Based Automated Therapy of Arm Function After Stroke Via Tele-Rehabilitation,7595070,R01HD053750,"['Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Membrum superius ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' distraction ', ' Electronics ', ' Dose ', ' Equipment ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Motor ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Text ', ' Limb structure ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Procedures ', ' Hand ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hemipareses ', ' hemiparetic ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Laboratories ', ' disability ', ' handicapping condition ', ' handicapping ', ' Infirmity ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Collaborations ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Simulate ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Shapes ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Running ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Automation ', ' Hour ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Upper arm ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' motor deficit ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' virtual reality ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Accounting ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' chronic stroke ', ' constraint induced movement therapy ', ' prototype ', ' telerehabilitation ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2009,289970,0.2006927253836023

"Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Geographic and racial disparities in stroke mortality have existed for over 50 years with an incremental annual cost of $4.6 billion. Many causes for these disparities have been proposed, but existing research has inadequately addressed these, and interventions have failed to reduce their magnitude. Further, national data are not available describing the prevalence of cognitive decline, a problem largely caused by cerebrovascular disease and its risk factors. With completion of recruitment, baseline evaluation and follow-up of a national cohort of 30,000 black and white community dwelling participants, the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study is uniquely positioned to test older but unsubstantiated hypotheses explaining race/region disparities, to assess new evidence-based hypotheses, and to provide the first national data on predictors of cognitive decline. In this continuation application we propose to continue follow-up for incident stroke and cognitive decline among this cohort, which will quadruple the number of observed stroke events arid provide longitudinal data on cognitive decline. These data will provide the opportunity to investigate the underlying causes of the disparities in stroke mortality by assessing the role of confounding factors to mediate the observed excess risk among African Americans and Southerners, and to develop risk functions for relatively rare stroke subtypes including ICH and SAH. Preliminary analysis from REGARDS suggests that there is a-""cognitive decline belt"" that is concordant with the Stroke belt. The data from the continuation will allow a refinement of the description of these disparities, and, using similar analysis approaches employed for the stroke outcomes, will provide insights into the causes for these disparities. Finally, we will investigate the role of cognitive decline as a predictor for subsequent stroke events. Completion of these aims will allow for development of interventions to eliminate disparities in the incidence of stroke and cognitive decline. Implementation of specific interventions customized for black and white populations, and by region of the United States, may reduce health disparities in stroke recognition and treatment, risk factor prevention, and optimal management of existing risk factors.

"Stroke Incidence and Risk Factors in a Tri-Ethnic Region    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke and cognitive impairment remain a major public health problem with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. The reasons for these race-ethnic disparities are not entirely clear. Improved detection and control of novel stroke risk factors are needed to reduce vascular disease burden. The Northern Manhattan prospective cohort consists of a population-based cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults enrolled since 2001 who have been followed annually for stroke, MI, and death. This collaborative study now involves faculty across 2 academic institutions and is the first prospective cohort study among whites, blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community. Over the last 5 years, the aims have expanded to include subclinical carotid, cardiac, and brain measures. High-resolution carotid imaging data has been assembled on 1770 subjects and a neuropsychological battery and standardized brain MRI will be completed on 1300 subjects with quantitative analyses to measure white matter hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds. This grant supports continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke, MI, and vascular death) and adiponectin, a new marker of obesity, new measures of subclinical carotid disease (carotid plaque area and densitometry), and quantitative MRI measures of vascular subclinical brain disease, as well as evaluate the impact on cognitive decline. To accomplish these aims, stored baseline plasma will be used to measure fasting adiponectin levels. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be quantitatively analyzed from standardized digital recordings. Repeat neuro-psychological testing emphasizing frontal-executive domains will be done on 1105 subjects. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive for any vascular event. Community stroke surveillance will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. The strengths of this cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of traditional and emerging risk factors, and the innovative assessment of MRI subclinical disease and carotid subclinical disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and coronary heart disease comprise two of the top three leading causes of death in the US and are of increasing importance in developing countries. While heart disease is the leading cause of death, stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. Stroke continues to have a disproportionate impact on mortality for blacks compared to whites. The aging and rapid growth of the black and Hispanic population has the potential to lead to future increases in the public health impact of stroke and vascular disease. The economic burden in the US due to stroke among Hispanics and blacks from 2005 to 2050 is projected to be $313 billion for Hispanics, and $379 billion for blacks.       Race-ethnic disparities are driven by differences in stroke incidence and vascular risk factors and have remained significant even after accounting for differences in socioeconomic status. Healthy People 2010 called for an elimination of race-ethnic disparities, but did not provide a clear method to achieve this lofty goal.       The principal goals of our study are to help fill the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of stroke and vascular disease particularly among blacks and Hispanics in order to improve future prevention efforts. We have broadened our focus to investigate markers of obesity, subclinical disease measures of the carotid arteries and brain, and predictors of vascular cognitive impairment and decline. We need to understand the importance of these conditions in predicting stroke, MI, vascular death, and determining cognitive decline among minority populations.

"Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the highly successful Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project. BASIC is the only ongoing stroke surveillance project focusing on Mexican Americans. Mexican Americans are the largest segment of the Hispanic American population, the United States' largest minority group. Since the inception of this project in January 2000, we have assembled a cohort of over 4,992 cerebrovascular disease patients for whom we are able to follow for recurrent cerebrovascular events as well as mortality. This gives us tremendous power to detect associations with biological and social risk factors for stroke, important to Mexican Americans as well as the broader United States population. We have demonstrated increased stroke incidence and recurrence in Mexican Americans. Stroke severity and ischemic stroke subtypes are similar between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Mortality following stroke appears to be less in Mexican Americans. In the next five years we are positioned to delineate trends in stroke rates, and to explore the potential reasons for the increased stroke burden in Mexican Americans, as well as their improved survival. This information will be critically important to all populations to reduce the devastation of stroke. We will continue to make important observations useful for planning delivery of stroke care in communities. For the first time we will investigate functional and cognitive outcome following stroke in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We will now also study the role of health care quality and medication compliance on stroke outcomes. We will collect blood on all stroke patients useful for genetic studies by our group and others, and we have initiated stroke surveillance in a similar community within Mexico that will serve as a great basis for comparison to the Corpus Christi population. BASIC has been a very prolific study with more than 27 original peer-reviewed publications in the last four years alone. Indeed, this study is just beginning to provide the rich epidemiologic and clinical data that are necessary to control the epidemic of cerebrovascular disease in Mexican Americans. We know that the next five years will allow us to make contributions that will be directly useful for interventions to reduce health disparities, prevent stroke and improve stroke outcomes in all populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a competitive renewal for the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project. This highly successful community-based stroke epidemiology project seeks to understand the health disparity for stroke among Mexican Americans and non Hispanic whites in Corpus Christi, Texas.

"Stroke Disparities Program    DESCRIPTION (abstract): Acute stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the US. A disproportionate amount of morbidity and mortality falls on underserved populations. Reduction of health disparities has become a significant public health challenge and is a major goal of the Healthy People 2010 initiative. The programmatic goal of this proposal is to identify biological and socioeconomic factors contributing to ethnic disparities and to develop innovative approaches to reduce these disparities for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Three research projects are proposed. Project 1, Acute Stroke Program of Interventions addressing Racial and Ethnic disparities (ASPIRE), is an intervention study designed to investigate whether implementation of a multilevel intervention can significantly increase the number of ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) in a predominantly underserved community. The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of all ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with IV tPA. Project 2, Preventing Recurrence of Thromboembolic Events through Coordinated Treatment in the District of Columbia (PROTECT DC) is a randomized phase II clinical trial of the PROTECT DC intervention (hospital-based initiation of aggressive secondary prevention combined with navigator case management) vs. standard management in ischemic stroke patients from two underserved hospitals in the District of Columbia. The primary aims are 1) to refine the PROTECT DC design in preparation for a phase INI trial and, 2) to assess the effect of the intervention on 4 medication goals as defined by normalization of objective measures of secondary risk factor control. Project 3, DiffErenCes in the Imaging of Primary Hemorrhage based on Ethnicity or Race (DECIPHER) is a longitudinal, MR imaging, prospective, observational, cohort study designed to evaluate the prevalence and significance by race/ethnicity of chronic cerebral microbleeds in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage. Three cores will support the projects: A) Administration B) Participant Recruitment, Retention, Intervention and Outcomes, and C) Biostatistics / Data Management. This application is designed not only to define factors leading to racial/ethnic disparities in stroke treatment and outcomes, but also to demonstrate the efficacy of programs specifically designed to reduce these disparities.      Project 1: Acute Stroke Program of Interventions Addressing Racial and Ethnic Disparities (ASPIRE)   PI: Amie Hsia      DESCRIPTION: Stroke, the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, has a disproportionate impact on underserved populations that is reflected in higher incidence and mortality rates in these groups. Several studies have suggested that blacks are less likely than whites to receive intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA), the only FDA-approved acute ischemic stroke therapy. Efforts are needed to elucidate factors contributing to racial/ethnic disparities in access to acute stroke care and to develop programs to overcome these barriers. The specific aims of this intervention project are: A) to identify previously unrecognized sociocultural and environmental barriers to acute stroke treatment in an underserved, urban population; B) to investigate whether implementation of a multilevel intervention designed to address these barriers can significantly increase the number of ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA); and C) to perform program evaluation of the methods used in the intervention to determine which efforts are the most effective. The investigators will assist each of 6 hospitals in the District of Columbia to develop a team of Stroke Champions to implement educational programs and standardized procedures designed to improve acute stroke care. Five Baltimore hospitals will serve as the control group. Essential design features of this project include: 1) a focus on underserved populations to identify community-specific barriers and then tailor existing stroke education materials to increase health literacy and decrease delays in seeking treatment; 2) implementation of interventions to address educational, attitudinal, and structural barriers at the public, paramedic and hospital levels; and 3) assignment of a dedicated research coordinator to each hospital who will also serve as a Stroke Champion. The long term objective of the trial is to identify systematic, reproducible, effective methods for improving the delivery of acute stroke therapies in underserved areas that can be implemented in a broader arena. The only way to definitively affect outcomes for underserved stroke patients is to elucidate the complex issues related to access to treatment, and the District of Columbia is the ideal city in which to perform these investigations.          ",Stroke Disparities Program,7691334,U54NS057405,[''],NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U54,2009,2034544,0.3987200996869711
"Web-based stroke education for patients and families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic stroke is a major source of illness burden in the US. Stroke survivors are at high risk for recurrence and therefore they are an important group for secondary prevention. However, gaps in knowledge among stroke survivors, including inadequate knowledge of the early warning signs of stroke, inadequate understanding of the purpose and goals of rehabilitation, and lack of awareness of personal risk factors, lead to preventable stroke-related morbidity. Education to address these knowledge gaps is typically inadequate during inpatient rehabilitation for stroke. An effective program of education for stroke survivors could improve stroke outcomes by promoting rehabilitation, reducing the risk of another stroke and reducing morbidity of recurrent strokes. In the Phase I SBIR, we established the feasibility of developing a web-based education for stroke survivors and their families. We developed a prototype to impart basic knowledge about stroke, including warning signs, risk factors, and management of one of the common risk factors (hypertension). This prototype is an interactive web-based educational program, using video format and animation, as well as self-assessments and adaptive learning through computer technology to address cognitive deficits. A pilot study of this prototype with 25 stroke patients and 7 caregivers was conducted, with approximately half of the subjects using the Web-based training without adaptive learning, and the other half with adaptive learning. The program was well-accepted and stroke-related knowledge improved significantly compared to baseline for all subjects. Without the adaptive learning, the mean improvement in correct answers on pre-post testing was 2.0. When the adaptive learning component was integrated into the Web-based training, the mean improvement in correct answers on pre-post testing was 5.1. The Phase I prototype can be accessed for review at www.strokelearning.com. We now propose in Phase II to complete the development of this web-based program, so that it addresses all of the main manageable risk factors, provides general stroke knowledge, and provides an understanding of stroke rehabilitation. Importantly, this program will maintain a focus on changing patients' behavior, empowering them to reduce their risk for further strokes and benefit more optimally from rehabilitation. The program will also adapt to patients' level of knowledge and cognitive impairments. It will iteratively measure gains in knowledge by patients and caregivers and in doing so will reinforce learning over multiple sessions. As part of Phase II, we will test the efficacy of this program in improving patient and caregiver stroke knowledge at the time of discharge, and monitor change in risk- related behavior (smoking) at 2 and 6 weeks post-discharge in a controlled trial of 200 stroke patients and family members. This program will be a marketable product to providers of medical treatment for stroke, including rehabilitation hospitals which must meet specific patient education requirements, hospitals which are seeking stroke specialty certification and nursing homes. Additionally, insurance companies that wish to improve stroke prevention efforts (and thus save costs as well as improve patients' quality of care) may be a source of revenue. Stroke, the 3rd leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US afflicts between 700,000 and one million Americans annually, with African-Americans at particularly high risk. The 4.8 million stroke survivors in the US represent a large at-risk group for a recurrence of stroke. In fact, they are at 15 times greater risk of stroke compared to age-matched normals. The overall goal of this application is to develop a web-based interactive video program that would improve the education of stroke survivors and their caregivers while in rehabilitation and beyond, in order to identify personal risk factors, modify behavior, and ultimately reduce the occurrence of repeat strokes and reduction of overall stroke-related morbidity.             ",Web-based stroke education for patients and families,7688030,R44NS052948,"['African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family member ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' stroke education ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' modifiable risk ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' control trial ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Computers ', ' Fostering ', ' Self Perception ', ' self knowledge ', ' self awareness ', ' Self view ', ' Self image ', ' Personal awareness ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement (Psychology) ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Self Assessment (Psychology) ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' animation ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Hospitals ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' stroke rehab ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Survivors ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Time ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' meetings ', ' empowered ', ' American ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Certification ', ' Measures ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' ']",NINDS,"FOX LEARNING SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2009,377254,0.44610080104255284
"Stroke Incidence and Risk Factors in a Tri-Ethnic Region    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke and cognitive impairment remain a major public health problem with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. The reasons for these race-ethnic disparities are not entirely clear. Improved detection and control of novel stroke risk factors are needed to reduce vascular disease burden. The Northern Manhattan prospective cohort consists of a population-based cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults enrolled since 2001 who have been followed annually for stroke, MI, and death. This collaborative study now involves faculty across 2 academic institutions and is the first prospective cohort study among whites, blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community. Over the last 5 years, the aims have expanded to include subclinical carotid, cardiac, and brain measures. High-resolution carotid imaging data has been assembled on 1770 subjects and a neuropsychological battery and standardized brain MRI will be completed on 1300 subjects with quantitative analyses to measure white matter hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds. This grant supports continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke, MI, and vascular death) and adiponectin, a new marker of obesity, new measures of subclinical carotid disease (carotid plaque area and densitometry), and quantitative MRI measures of vascular subclinical brain disease, as well as evaluate the impact on cognitive decline. To accomplish these aims, stored baseline plasma will be used to measure fasting adiponectin levels. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be quantitatively analyzed from standardized digital recordings. Repeat neuro-psychological testing emphasizing frontal-executive domains will be done on 1105 subjects. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive for any vascular event. Community stroke surveillance will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. The strengths of this cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of traditional and emerging risk factors, and the innovative assessment of MRI subclinical disease and carotid subclinical disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and coronary heart disease comprise two of the top three leading causes of death in the US and are of increasing importance in developing countries. While heart disease is the leading cause of death, stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. Stroke continues to have a disproportionate impact on mortality for blacks compared to whites. The aging and rapid growth of the black and Hispanic population has the potential to lead to future increases in the public health impact of stroke and vascular disease. The economic burden in the US due to stroke among Hispanics and blacks from 2005 to 2050 is projected to be $313 billion for Hispanics, and $379 billion for blacks.       Race-ethnic disparities are driven by differences in stroke incidence and vascular risk factors and have remained significant even after accounting for differences in socioeconomic status. Healthy People 2010 called for an elimination of race-ethnic disparities, but did not provide a clear method to achieve this lofty goal.       The principal goals of our study are to help fill the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of stroke and vascular disease particularly among blacks and Hispanics in order to improve future prevention efforts. We have broadened our focus to investigate markers of obesity, subclinical disease measures of the carotid arteries and brain, and predictors of vascular cognitive impairment and decline. We need to understand the importance of these conditions in predicting stroke, MI, vascular death, and determining cognitive decline among minority populations.             ",Stroke Incidence and

"The Effect of Socioeconomic Status on Outcome After Stroke Poverty can shorten the average person's life span by up to ten years. In the U. S., the disparity in mortality between social classes has worsened over the last 30 years. However, studies have shown that the general public fears significant disabilityafter stroke more than death, and yet the literatureregarding functional outcome after stroke is much less comprehensive. Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been shown to have a deleterious effect on functional outcome in many other disease processes. Similarly, low SES has been associated with a poorer health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in many diseases. While the HRQL has been examined in several studies regarding stroke, none to date have considered the direct impact of SES on outcome following stroke.  Thus, we have identified a significant gap in our knowledgeregarding the effect of SES on outcome and qualityof life in stroke patients. This gap in knowledge makes it difficult to interpret studies of outcome after stroke, or studies of interventions designed to improve outcome after stroke From the literature examining SES in other disease processes, we have reason to believe that socioeconomic status will have a significant impact on functional outcome and quality of life after stroke. Therefore, the next logical step is to study the impact of socioeconomicfactors on functional outcome and quality of life after stroke,  We hypothesize that having a lower SES at the time of stroke will negatively impact a stroke patient's functional outcome and HRQOL. We plan to study this question by utilizing a prospective cohort of stroke patients already being collected as part of the larger epidemiology of stroke project underway at the University of Cincinnati. We will evaluate both individual and aggregate indicators of SES, and to construct models describing the effect of these indicators on functional outcome and quality of life. We also plan to study the change over time in SES after stroke.

"Stroke Health and Risk Education (SHARE)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is a disease with tremendous individual, family, and societal impact. It is the number one cause of adult disability and third leading cause of death in the United States. Between now and the year 2050, the cost of stroke in the United States will exceed 2 trillion dollars. There is a tremendous ethnic disparity with respect to stroke in the United States. Mexican Americans are much more likely to have a stroke compared with European Americans. In Mexican Americans strokes occur at younger ages, are more likely to recur and have the same severity as they do in European Americans. Mexican Americans are the overwhelming largest sub- population of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority group. This proposal, a scientifically-based rigorous behavioral education intervention trial, seeks to aggressively prevent stroke, especially in Mexican Americans. Faith and family are strong components of Mexican American culture. This project works with these positive fundamental elements in order to affect stroke prevention. This project will take place in Nueces County, Texas. The project investigators have worked in this community for the past 14 years and have published extensively regarding the stroke health disparity in this stable, non-immigrant community of Mexican Americans and European Americans. We have established a strong partnership with the Catholic Diocese of Corpus Christi and assembled a team with tremendous experience at successful health behavior intervention research. Together, a proposal has been crafted that will directly speak to aggressive stroke risk factor reduction in Mexican Americans and European Americans in this representative United States community. The significance of such research is tremendous. As the Mexican American population grows and ages, the stroke impact will be felt with greater and greater intensity. Now is the time to develop aggressive, scientifically tested interventions to limit the burden of this disease on this important segment of the United States population, and to reduce the costs of this disease to the country as a whole, in keeping with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) goal to ""identify culturally appropriate, effective stroke prevention programs for nationwide implementation in minority communities"" by FY2010. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mexican Americans, the largest sub-population of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority group, have a higher risk of stroke than non-Hispanic whites. This proposal seeks to reduce stroke risk, especially in Mexican Americans, through a scientifically-based rigorous behavioral intervention trial. The public health impact of successful stroke prevention programs is enormous as stroke represents the number 3 killer and number one cause of disability in the United States.           Project Narrative Mexican Americans, the largest sub-population of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority group, have a higher risk of stroke than non-Hispanic whites.

"Ethnic Differences in the Risk of Fracture and Vascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The career objective of the K23 candidate is to become a rheumatic disease epidemiologist. In the context of mentored research, Dr. Curtis will examine the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes related to osteoporosis, with an emphasis on African Americans and men. To achieve this objective, Dr. Curtis has designed a didactic training program to augment his methodologic skills in analytic techniques relevant to large longitudinal studies. With supervision of experienced mentors, Dr. Curtis will obtain hands-on training in the conduct and analysis of an ancillary study to the 4 year R01 ""Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke"" study funded by the NINDS enrolling 30,000 African Americans and Caucasians. Although typically at lower risk for fractures than Caucasian women, African Americans and men suffer greater post-fracture morbidity and mortality. The ability to estimate absolute fracture risk among men and non-Caucasians is limited since these persons are relatively underrepresented in osteoporosis cohorts. Prior fracture appears to be an independent risk for subsequent stroke and myocardial infarction (Ml), but the association between bone and vascular disease in high risk, understudied populations is poorly understood. The specific aims of the K23 project are 1) Define ethnic/racial differences in relative and absolute fracture incidence over 4 years in 3 high risk groups (prevalent fracture; prior stroke; glucocorticoid use) compared to the overall cohort; 2) Determine ethnic/racial differences in stroke and Ml risk among those with prevalent fracture. Survival analysis will compare rates and risk factors for first and recurrent fractures and vascular events by ethnicity/race and gender. Shared risk factors for both bone and vascular disease will be examined in several secondary hypotheses based on an ancillary questionnaire sent to the entire cohort. Data generated from this project will provide a framework for future research proposals. Better understanding of the absolute and relative hazards associated with risk factors for fracture and associated vascular events in African Americans and men may lead to improved understanding of the underlying biology and help reduce ethnic/racial and gender-related disparities in osteoporosis care. Beyond the training objective of this award, the ultimate goal is better prevention through improved identification of those at highest risk for poor outcomes from osteoporotic fractures and associated vascular disease.             ",Ethnic Differences in the Risk of Fracture and Vascular Disease,7664454,K23AR053351,"['bisphosphonate ', ' diphosphonate ', ' biphosphonate ', ' Bisphosphonates ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Adrenergic beta-Antagonists ', ' beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blockaders ', ' beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents ', ' beta blocker ', ' Adrenergic beta-Blockers ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Therapeutic Glucocorticoid ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Postmenopause ', ' postmenopausal ', ' post-menopausal ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Persons ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Patients ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rheumatism ', ' Rheumatic Diseases ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain Disorder ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Supervision ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' vasculopathy ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Event ', ' Award ', ' Techniques ', ' osteoporosis with pathological fracture ', ' Osteoporotic fracture ', ' Osteoporosis with fracture ', ' Fracture due to osteoporosis ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' bone ', ' Bone Density ', ' Bone Mineral Density ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Spinal Fractures ', ' vertebral fracture ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' health organization ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' bone health ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K23,2009,129708,0.145644574292332
"REGARDS - MI Study BACKGROUND. As for stroke, geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality are recognized but poorly understood. NIH (NINDS) funded the Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study to follow 30,000 individuals(age >44; 1/2 African American, 1/2 European American; 1/2 female; 1/2 from the stroke belt/ buckle areas) over 3.5 years for stroke incidence and mortality. SPECIFIC AIMS. The overall goal of the REGARDS-MI Ancillary Study is to capitalize on a narrow window of opportunity to leverage REGARD'S infrastructure by quantifying geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality, attack rates (new and recurrent hospitalized acute CHD and pre-hospital CHD death in the population) and case fatality (among those with an acute CHD event, death within 28 days). Our Specific Aims are to (1) estimate US geographic- and ethnic-specificrates of CHD mortality, attack rates, and case fatality; (2) study the relationshipbetween US geographic- and ethnic-specific attack rates and variation in the prevalence of CHD risk factors; and (3) study the relationship between US geographic- andethnic-specific CHD case fatality and socioeconomic factors, medical care and CHD risk factors. METHODS. We will retrieve medical records for all heart-related hospitalizations(-6000) among REGARDS participants and collect data on all deaths (-500). We will adjudicatehospitalizations and deaths for CHD, collect cardiac procedures and medications, and merge this with extensive data already being collected by REGARDS. Using multivariable multi-levelanalyses, we will test 10 specific hypotheses. IMPLICATIONS. This will be the first nationwidestudy to relate CHD attack rate and case fatality, including pre-hospital deaths, to geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality. REGARDS offers aunique opportunity to attain our specific aims without the massive participant recruitment and follow-up costs that otherwise would be necessary. There is no budgetary overlap between REGARDS and REGARDS-MI as REGARDS focuses only on potential strokes. Our results will contribute significantlyto the knowledge base essential for attaining the Healthy People 2010 goal of reducing health disparities.

"Stroke Disparities Program Acute stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the US. A disproportionate amount of morbidity and mortality falls on underserved populations. Reduction of health disparities has become a significant public health challenge and is a major goal of the Healthy People 2010 initiative. The programmatic goal of this proposal is to identify biological and socioeconomic factors contributing to ethnic disparities and to develop innovative approaches to reduce these disparities for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Three research projects are proposed. Project 1, Acute Stroke Program of Interventions addressing Racial and Ethnic disparities (ASPIRE), is an intervention study designed to investigate whether implementation of a multilevel intervention can significantly increase the number of ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) in a predominantly underserved community. The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of all ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with IV tPA. Project 2, Preventing Recurrence of Thromboembolic Events through Coordinated Treatment in the District of Columbia (PROTECT DC) is a randomized phase II clinical trial of the PROTECT DC intervention (hospital-based initiation of aggressive secondary prevention combined with navigator case management) vs. standard management in ischemic stroke patients from two underserved hospitals in the District of Columbia. The primary aims are 1) to refine the PROTECT DC design in preparation for a phase INI trial and, 2) to assess the effect of the intervention on 4 medication goals as defined by normalization of objective measures of secondary risk factor control. Project 3, DiffErenCes in the Imaging of Primary Hemorrhage based on Ethnicity or Race (DECIPHER) is a longitudinal, MR imaging, prospective, observational, cohort study designed to evaluate the prevalence and significance by race/ethnicity of chronic cerebral microbleeds in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage. Three cores will support the projects: A) Administration B) Participant Recruitment, Retention, Intervention and Outcomes, and C) Biostatistics / Data Management. This application is designed not only to define factors leading to racial/ethnic disparities in stroke treatment and outcomes, but also to demonstrate the efficacy of programs specifically designed to reduce these disparities.

"Racial & Ethnic Disparities in Incidence and Inpatient Outcomes of Acute Stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most of the current literature on racial and ethnic disparities in stroke comes from comparing whites with minorities. To identify key modifiable factors underlying these disparities, we propose an alternative approach that follows from recognizing that there is immense diversity in stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) incidence and outcomes within each racial and ethnic subpopulation. Factors underlying higher incidence or worse outcomes for blacks may be different than those for Hispanics. As a preliminary demonstration, we examined incidence of acute ischemic stroke using data of all inpatient admissions in New Jersey and Arizona (2002-2004). Non- Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics were each stratified into three income categories - lower, middle and higher; age-sex adjusted acute stroke incidence rates were obtained for each cohort. A remarkably puzzling - and to the best of our knowledge previously unreported, finding is that in both the states, the stroke rate for Hispanics was systematically higher for higher income groups. In contrast, the income gradients for blacks and whites were downward sloping. The usefulness of this approach is immediately apparent. In New Jersey and Arizona, the excess stroke rate (relative to same-income whites) for Hispanics is 25 percent for lower income cohort but 200 percent for higher income cohort. Therefore higher incidence risk among Hispanics may be less due to SES-related potential factors (limited insurance, low income, public assistance, physician supply) and more due to potential factors such as physiological risk factors (diabetes, obesity, hypertension), health behavior (smoking, exercise), risk awareness, geographic location and provider-related characteristics. Limiting analysis to each racial/ethnic subgroup, our objective is to identify and assess which potential factors influence ""excess"" risk of stroke incidence and adverse hospital outcomes for the three racial and ethnic subpopulations. We propose to use data on all inpatient discharges during 2005-2007 from nine states (AZ, CA, FL, MA, NJ, NY, PA, SC and TX), with sizable minority populations. Incidence rates will be obtained by combining Census populations of each cohort. Hierarchical multivariate regression models negative binomial, logistic and linear, will be used to estimate the influence of each potential factor. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reductions in stroke incidence and advancements in care for acute stroke have been instrumental in the steady declines in stroke mortality since the 1960s. One concern in recent years is that this decline has leveled. A second concern is that these gains have been disproportionately distributed across race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. For effective targeting of interventions and public policy, our study aims to use evidence to identify and prioritize modifiable factors appropriate for each minority cohort.           Project Narrative Reductions in stroke incidence and advancements in care for acute stroke have been instrumental in the steady declines in stroke mortality since the 1960s.

"The Effect of Socioeconomic Status on Outcome After Stroke Poverty can shorten the average person's life span by up to ten years. In the U. S., the disparity in mortality between social classes has worsened over the last 30 years. However, studies have shown that the general public fears significant disabilityafter stroke more than death, and yet the literatureregarding functional outcome after stroke is much less comprehensive. Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been shown to have a deleterious effect on functional outcome in many other disease processes. Similarly, low SES has been associated with a poorer health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in many diseases. While the HRQL has been examined in several studies regarding stroke, none to date have considered the direct impact of SES on outcome following stroke.  Thus, we have identified a significant gap in our knowledgeregarding the effect of SES on outcome and qualityof life in stroke patients. This gap in knowledge makes it difficult to interpret studies of outcome after stroke, or studies of interventions designed to improve outcome after stroke From the literature examining SES in other disease processes, we have reason to believe that socioeconomic status will have a significant impact on functional outcome and quality of life after stroke. Therefore, the next logical step is to study the impact of socioeconomicfactors on functional outcome and quality of life after stroke,  We hypothesize that having a lower SES at the time of stroke will negatively impact a stroke patient's functional outcome and HRQOL. We plan to study this question by utilizing a prospective cohort of stroke patients already being collected as part of the larger epidemiology of stroke project underway at the University of Cincinnati. We will evaluate both individual and aggregate indicators of SES, and to construct models describing the effect of these indicators on functional outcome and quality of life. We also plan to study the change over time in SES after stroke. At the completion of this study, we will have determined the effect of SES on a stroke patient's outcome and HRQOL, and will have also determined the most powerful indicators of SES to be used in future studies of SES and stroke: Given theenormous burden of stroke on our nation and the ever-rising costs of health care, the need for a specialist that canbridge the gap between stroke care and socioeconomics is evident.

"Functional Impairment from Stroke: an Exploratory Study of Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding factors that determine long term outcomes after the onset of major medical conditions is key to identifying effective strategies to improve population health, reduce the prevalence of disability, and eliminate health disparities. Stroke is a leading cause of major disability in elderly Americans. Yet, research into pre- stroke social, contextual, or health characteristics that may reduce the consequences of stroke has been severely hampered by limitations in available data. Most of the preeminent stroke studies are regionally localized and/or initiate data collection upon hospitalization and diagnosis. Few data sources include nationwide samples of stroke survivors followed longitudinally from prior to stroke onset through the long-term recovery period. In data sets collected from only one or a few communities, it is impossible to test the effects of geographic or contextual risk factors on stroke outcomes, or to examine whether racial disparities are modified by such contextual factors. In studies that initiate enrollment at the onset of stroke, examining pre-stroke risk factors typically requires retrospective data collection. Without pre-stroke functional assessments, it is difficult to quantify how much of a functional decrement was induced by the stroke. Although it is difficult and expensive to collect medically verified stroke onset data in a national, prospective cohort, some already existing national longitudinal studies include self-reported stroke. The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is an ongoing, nationally representative study of Americans aged 50+ that routinely asks participants about history of stroke and other major medical conditions. Since inception, nearly 2,500 incident first strokes have been recorded for HRS participants, but the possibility of misreporting of stroke is a concern when using HRS data to study stroke outcomes. We propose three aims, 1) Quantify measurement error in self-reported incident strokes in the HRS, using linked Medicare claims records as a gold standard; 2) Examine national and regional racial disparities in the effects of stroke on mortality, cognitive impairments (assessed with word recall score and the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status), and physical limitations (instrumental and basic activities of daily living); and 3) Identify pre-stroke characteristics that modify the effects of stroke on health. This research builds on the extraordinary resources in HRS, which includes detailed socioeconomic measures and valuable longitudinal health data. This exploratory project would lay the groundwork for other applications of HRS data, including broader research on determinants of stroke incidence and post-stroke outcomes. These analyses will also provide a model for extensions to other self-reported medical conditions assessed in HRS, such as heart disease and diabetes, so future work could examine both risk factors for onset of these diseases and factors that determine level of functioning in the context of these conditions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to use data from the Health and Retirement Study, a national longitudinal study of Americans aged 50 and older, to study factors that improve people's functioning after stroke. First, we will compare the stroke records that study participants describe in interviews to their records from Medicare claims. Second, we will look to see if stroke affects black and white patients similarly. Third, we will test whether socioeconomic resources or other characteristics measured before stroke onset reduce the consequences of stroke on survival, memory and cognitive functioning, or physical independence.           Narrative We propose to use data from the Health and Retirement Study, a national longitudinal study of Americans aged 50 and older, to study factors that improve people's functioning after stroke.

"Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Geographic and racial disparities in stroke mortality have existed for over 50 years with an incremental annual cost of $4.6 billion. Many causes for these disparities have been proposed, but existing research has inadequately addressed these, and interventions have failed to reduce their magnitude. Further, national data are not available describing the prevalence of cognitive decline, a problem largely caused by cerebrovascular disease and its risk factors. With completion of recruitment, baseline evaluation and follow-up of a national cohort of 30,000 black and white community dwelling participants, the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study is uniquely positioned to test older but unsubstantiated hypotheses explaining race/region disparities, to assess new evidence-based hypotheses, and to provide the first national data on predictors of cognitive decline. In this continuation application we propose to continue follow-up for incident stroke and cognitive decline among this cohort, which will quadruple the number of observed stroke events arid provide longitudinal data on cognitive decline. These data will provide the opportunity to investigate the underlying causes of the disparities in stroke mortality by assessing the role of confounding factors to mediate the observed excess risk among African Americans and Southerners, and to develop risk functions for relatively rare stroke subtypes including ICH and SAH. Preliminary analysis from REGARDS suggests that there is a-""cognitive decline belt"" that is concordant with the Stroke belt. The data from the continuation will allow a refinement of the description of these disparities, and, using similar analysis approaches employed for the stroke outcomes, will provide insights into the causes for these disparities. Finally, we will investigate the role of cognitive decline as a predictor for subsequent stroke events. Completion of these aims will allow for development of interventions to eliminate disparities in the incidence of stroke and cognitive decline. Implementation of specific interventions customized for black and white populations, and by region of the United States, may reduce health disparities in stroke recognition and treatment, risk factor prevention, and optimal management of existing risk factors.

"Effect of Statins and Modifiable Factors on Stroke Outcome in Atrial Fibrillation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the third leading cause of mortality and a leading cause of disability in the U.S. Cardioembolic strokes resulting from atrial fibrillation (AF) are particularly devastating, with a 30-day mortality of 25%. The number of individuals with AF is projected to reach 8 million by 2020, and will disproportionately burden the elderly. The challenge and paradox of AF is that many of the risk factors for stroke are also risk factors for hemorrhage, limiting the use of anticoagulant therapy among those at greatest risk. Patients enrolled in clinical trials often bear little resemblance to the higher risk patients in clinical practice making it difficult to extrapolate estimates of treatment efficacy and safety. Trial participants are younger, more often male, less medically complex, less symptomatic, and specifically selected for lower bleeding risk. Despite their greater burden of risk factors, minorities have constituted less than 5% of AF trial populations. Aspirin is a marginally effective therapy in AF and causes bleeding almost as frequently as anticoagulants, particularly in the elderly. For instance, the rate of intracranial hemorrhage has quintupled in recent years, due to expanded use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy in older adults; 46% are fatal. Preventive strategies without attendant bleeding risk are urgently needed to mitigate the impact of stroke in AF. Although proinflammatory stimuli like hyperglycemia, infection, accelerated hypertension, heart failure, and dyslipidemia are potent triggers for thrombin generation, their effect on AF stroke outcomes has not been studied. The anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties of HMG CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) provide a biological rationale to hypothesize reduced severity (size) of AF stroke. Experimental studies report reduced platelet deposition; platelet mediated thrombin generation, and reduced infarct volume. The relations among statins, modifiable and nonmodifiable stroke risk factors, antithrombotic therapy and AF stroke outcomes have yet to be elucidated. To address these knowledge gaps, we will assemble a large cohort of consecutive AF stroke admissions (ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage) from 2006-2010 (n=2,500, 35% underrepresented minority, 43% >75 years of age) from 3 strategic sites to address the following aims:  1. To determine AF stroke disability and 30-day case fatality by age, sex, race/ethnicity;  2. To examine the relation of acute prothrombotic inflammatory triggers on stroke severity in AF;  3. To study the associations of antithrombotic treatment, including statins, and risk factors to stroke  severity in AF. Our application will address these aims through the unique and complementary strengths of  the collaborating investigators and institutions: Boston Medical Center, University of Alabama, and Geisinger  Health System of Pennsylvania. Our application will inform critical knowledge gaps in AF stroke, target  strategies to mitigate stroke severity, and assess the relations of antithrombotic and statin therapy to stroke  outcomes across the spectrum of stroke risk among diverse AF patient populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reduction of stroke disability and racial/ethnic disparities in stroke deaths is a pressing U.S. health concern.

"Stroke Health and Risk Education (SHARE)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is a disease with tremendous individual, family, and societal impact. It is the number one cause of adult disability and third leading cause of death in the United States. Between now and the year 2050, the cost of stroke in the United States will exceed 2 trillion dollars. There is a tremendous ethnic disparity with respect to stroke in the United States. Mexican Americans are much more likely to have a stroke compared with European Americans. In Mexican Americans strokes occur at younger ages, are more likely to recur and have the same severity as they do in European Americans. Mexican Americans are the overwhelming largest sub- population of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority group. This proposal, a scientifically-based rigorous behavioral education intervention trial, seeks to aggressively prevent stroke, especially in Mexican Americans. Faith and family are strong components of Mexican American culture. This project works with these positive fundamental elements in order to affect stroke prevention. This project will take place in Nueces County, Texas. The project investigators have worked in this community for the past 14 years and have published extensively regarding the stroke health disparity in this stable, non-immigrant community of Mexican Americans and European Americans. We have established a strong partnership with the Catholic Diocese of Corpus Christi and assembled a team with tremendous experience at successful health behavior intervention research. Together, a proposal has been crafted that will directly speak to aggressive stroke risk factor reduction in Mexican Americans and European Americans in this representative United States community. The significance of such research is tremendous. As the Mexican American population grows and ages, the stroke impact will be felt with greater and greater intensity. Now is the time to develop aggressive, scientifically tested interventions to limit the burden of this disease on this important segment of the United States population, and to reduce the costs of this disease to the country as a whole, in keeping with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) goal to ""identify culturally appropriate, effective stroke prevention programs for nationwide implementation in minority communities"" by FY2010. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mexican Americans, the largest sub-population of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority group, have a higher risk of stroke than non-Hispanic whites. This proposal seeks to reduce stroke risk, especially in Mexican Americans, through a scientifically-based rigorous behavioral intervention trial. The public health impact of successful stroke prevention programs is enormous as stroke represents the number 3 killer and number one cause of disability in the United States.

"Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to continue our population-based study of stroke incidence, risk factors, treatment, and outcome of stroke within our biracial metropolitan population of 1,349,351, of whom 215,611 (15%) are of black race (US Census 2000). We have studied trends in stroke incidence and case fatality, as well as the prevalence of risk factors and knowledge of stroke (via a population survey) for almost 15 years and have demonstrated a racial disparity where stroke incidence in African-Americans is more than double that of whites. In addition to continuing these important activities, we propose an innovative pilot study that will be the largest prospective, population-based stroke outcomes study to date. The anticipated ~3,200 patients with strokes and 800 TIAs from our region in 2010, as well as the 2,000 surveyed participants, will be used to test the following hypotheses: 1. Temporal trends in the incidence rate of stroke will demonstrate a decrease over time in whites (as shown by our 2005 preliminary data). However, there will not be a similar decrease among blacks, a racial group that has not been examined in other temporal studies of stroke. We expect that case fatality rates will not change between periods, and will be similar for both blacks and whites. 2. A cohort of subjects followed by a regional HIE combined with phone-call follow-up will be more representative of the entire stroke population in our region than a cohort of subjects that agree to in-person interviews, which is likely to have participation and survival biases. Information obtained via this approach will be as valid as data from manual chart abstraction and direct interview for determining access to care and individual patients' functional outcome after stroke across a region, and will be more efficient to collect than that obtained via manual processes. 3. The proportion of the population that knows warning signs or risk factors for stroke will NOT improve between 2006 and 2011, based on our preliminary data. When subjects are asked about their own personal risk for stroke, a lower self-perceived risk will be associated with worse stroke knowledge. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The change in stroke occurrence over time is the ultimate test of how well science has translated new discoveries into benefits for the population. Our study has examined racial disparities in stroke over the last 15 years, showing that blacks have higher risk for stroke than whites. In our population, the occurrence of stroke is decreasing in whites but not African Americans, and we will continue to describe trends in stroke occurrence, cause, treatment, and outcome in a biracial metropolitan population.              RELEVANCE: The change in stroke occurrence over time is the ultimate test of how well science has translated new discoveries into benefits for the population.

"Stroke Health and Risk Education (SHARE)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is a disease with tremendous individual, family, and societal impact. It is the number one cause of adult disability and third leading cause of death in the United States. Between now and the year 2050, the cost of stroke in the United States will exceed 2 trillion dollars. There is a tremendous ethnic disparity with respect to stroke in the United States. Mexican Americans are much more likely to have a stroke compared with European Americans. In Mexican Americans strokes occur at younger ages, are more likely to recur and have the same severity as they do in European Americans. Mexican Americans are the overwhelming largest sub- population of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority group. This proposal, a scientifically-based rigorous behavioral education intervention trial, seeks to aggressively prevent stroke, especially in Mexican Americans. Faith and family are strong components of Mexican American culture. This project works with these positive fundamental elements in order to affect stroke prevention. This project will take place in Nueces County, Texas. The project investigators have worked in this community for the past 14 years and have published extensively regarding the stroke health disparity in this stable, non-immigrant community of Mexican Americans and European Americans. We have established a strong partnership with the Catholic Diocese of Corpus Christi and assembled a team with tremendous experience at successful health behavior intervention research. Together, a proposal has been crafted that will directly speak to aggressive stroke risk factor reduction in Mexican Americans and European Americans in this representative United States community. The significance of such research is tremendous. As the Mexican American population grows and ages, the stroke impact will be felt with greater and greater intensity. Now is the time to develop aggressive, scientifically tested interventions to limit the burden of this disease on this important segment of the United States population, and to reduce the costs of this disease to the country as a whole, in keeping with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) goal to ""identify culturally appropriate, effective stroke prevention programs for nationwide implementation in minority communities"" by FY2010.

"Ethnic/Racial Variation in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) occurs when a blood vessel ruptures within the brain parenchyma leading to neurologic injury and frequently death. Approximately 40-50% of patients who suffer from an ICH will die from the hemorrhage. Of the survivors, the majority are disabled. Thus, ICH is the subtype of stroke with the highest morbidity and mortality rates. Minority populations of African-Americans and Hispanics have been found to have roughly double the rate of ICH as whites and on average, have ICH at a younger age. Yet despite this disproportionate health care burden, fewer than 200 ICH cases among African-Americans and less than a hundred ICH cases among Hispanics have been collected with DNA available for testing. Our proposal is to collect 1000 cases of ICH among whites, 1000 cases of ICH among blacks, 1000 cases of ICH among Hispanics, and 3000 controls matched to the cases by race/ethnicity, age (5 years), gender and geographic location. Our long-term goal is to perform a genome-wide association study of intracerebral hemorrhage which includes a significant proportion of minorities with ICH. A genome-wide association study evaluates DNA with hundreds of thousands of markers to identify regions or genes which are associated with either a greater or lesser risk of ICH. However, the current proposal will not complete this type of analysis as insufficient numbers are currently available. Thus, the goals of the current proposal are to: 1) understand the risk factors of greatest importance for ICH among blacks and Hispanics; 2) determine differences in brain-imaging by race/ethnicity; 3) determine factors that mediate differences in outcomes rates by race/ethnicity; and 4) determine if Hispanics and African-Americans from different regions or national origin (such as Mexican, Cuban, etc.) are genetically different. To accomplish these goals, we have 11 recruitment centers representing 30 recruitment hospitals throughout the United States with large populations of African-Americans and Hispanics. White ICH cases from the same regions will also be recruited to account for regional differences in risk factors as well as a comparison group for risk factors, outcomes and imaging differences. A centralized neuroimaging center will be developed for uniform reading and analysis of films at Massachusetts General Hospital in conjunction with Georgetown University. A biorepository will be developed for centralized DNA processing and sample handling at the Miami Institute for Human Genomics. And a data and statistical center will be developed at Wake Forest University. The major advantages of this study are the experience of the investigators, particularly with recruitment of minority populations and particular interest in ICH and epidemiology; uniform definitions of cases, risk factors, and centralized analyses; and the ability to identify and recruit the large number of subjects (6000 total) required for the study.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability among adults. More people are disabled by stroke than Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, cancer or AIDS. Intracerebral hemorrhage is the type of stroke with the highest death and disability rates. ICH occurs in 70,000 Americans every year and a single year of ICH cases in the United States leads to approximately $3.7 billion dollars of health care costs. African-Americans and Hispanics have twice the rate of this type of stroke than whites do and have this type of stroke at an earlier age in life. Yet we know little about the biologic differences that lead to this ethnic disparity. Our proposal will compare minorities with ICH to controls from the same population as well as explore genetic,   radiographic and outcomes differences.           Study Relevance:  Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability among adults.

"Home-Based Automated Therapy of Arm Function After Stroke Via Tele-Rehabilitation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Constraint-Induced Movement therapy (CIMT) is one of few techniques that has been shown in controlled studies to produce large improvements in real-world arm function in stroke survivors with mild to moderate hemiparesis. The standard treatment involves one-on-one training of paretic arm use in the clinic for 3 hr/day for 10 consecutive weekdays and placing a mitt on the other hand to discourage its use. The considerable cost of CIMT, due to the demand on therapist time and requirement that patients travel daily to a clinic for 2 weeks, imposes substantial limits on those who might access the therapy. Our lab, with Peter Lum, Ph.D., has developed a device for automating the delivery of CIMT named AutoCITE; it permits practice of 8 upper- extremity tasks and provides frequent graphical performance feedback. Two reports indicate that AutoCITE is as efficacious as standard CIMT even with therapist effort reduced by 75%. A third report suggests that AutoCITE under simulated telerehabilitation conditions (i.e., patient and therapist were in different rooms in the lab) is also just as efficacious. We propose to modify AutoCITE so that it is more appropriate for use in patients' homes and evaluate its efficacy for providing CIMT on a telerehab basis. We will also specifically test whether making the AutoCITE software more interactive helps patients to comply with training at home, where there are more distractions. To this end, we will randomize 87 chronic stroke survivors to: 1. AutoCITE training in the home with two patients supervised concurrently by one therapist remotely via an Internet-based audio- visual link, 2. the same procedures except that the more interactive software will be run on AutoCITE, and 3. dose-matched, standard CIMT in the home. Motor outcomes and costs from the home-based, two-on-one, tele-AutoCITE groups will be compared to those from the home-based, one-on-one, in vivo CIMT group and to those from laboratory-based AutoCITE and standard CIMT groups run previously. If successful, AutoCITE, which involves simply automating task practice with actual objects and is much less expensive than prevailing virtual reality based approaches, might serve as a platform for delivering other upper-extremity therapies, in addition to CIMT, via telerehab. With about 300,000 new stroke survivors suffering motor disability annually, cutting the cost of and increasing access to efficacious upper-extremity rehabilitation has the potential to reduce disability significantly.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Our laboratory, in collaboration with Peter Lum, Ph.D., has developed a device for automating the delivery of Constraint-Induced Movement therapy (CI therapy) named AutoCITE; it permits practice of 8 upper-extremity tasks and provides frequent graphical performance feedback. Two recently published studies suggest that AutoCITE is as efficacious as one-one-one CI therapy. Our proposed study will test the efficacy of the AutoCITE device to provide CI therapy on a tele-rehabilitation basis in patients' home. There are approximately 300,000 new strokes survivors with residual motor disability annually. Reducing the cost of and increasing access to efficacious upper-extremity rehabilitation has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of stroke on patients, their families and the healthcare system.       ",Home-Based Automated Therapy of Arm Function After Stroke Via Tele-Rehabilitation,7793534,R01HD053750,"['Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Membrum superius ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' distraction ', ' Electronics ', ' Dose ', ' Equipment ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Motor ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Text ', ' Limb structure ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Procedures ', ' Hand ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hemipareses ', ' hemiparetic ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Laboratories ', ' disability ', ' handicapping condition ', ' handicapping ', ' Infirmity ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Collaborations ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Simulate ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Shapes ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Running ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Automation ', ' Hour ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' motor deficit ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' virtual reality ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Accounting ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' chronic stroke ', ' constraint induced movement therapy ', ' prototype ', ' telerehabilitation ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2010,287470,0.2006927253836023
"Infection and Stroke in Mexican Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the third leading cause of death and leading cause of disability in adults in the US. Nearly 800,000 people suffer a stroke annually, and more than 143,000 deaths occur as a result. Hispanic Americans are the fastest growing minority population in the US, as well as the most numerous. The majority of Hispanic Americans are of Mexican descent. Mexican Americans (MAs) have an increased risk of stroke especially at younger ages when disability has the greatest impact. Reasons for increased stroke risk in MAs are not fully understood but traditional risk factors are not likely to fully account for the increased stroke burden in this population. Chronic infectious pathogens have been proposed as risk factors for stroke and for poor stroke outcome, although the evidence remains inconclusive and studies have not been done in MAs. As chronic infections are more prevalent in MAs than their non-Hispanic white counterparts, this risk factor may be particularly important for this population. The proposed dissertation research seeks to examine the links between chronic infection and incident stroke and post-stroke functional outcome, among participants from the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA). This research will extend current knowledge of infection and stroke in several critical ways:1) by examining antibody response to several infectious agents versus infection serostatus as independent risk factors for stroke, 2) by examining the underlying mechanisms, including inflammatory pathways, by which antibody response may influence stroke risk, 3) by investigating the association of antibody response to post-stroke functional outcomes and 4) by focusing specifically in a MA population known to experience a greater stroke burden as well as a greater infection burden. The recognition that infection increases stroke risk after accounting for traditional risk factors may have important implications for the prevention of stroke in MAs and for reducing the stroke health disparity in this population. In addition to advancing the science in this critical area, the proposed fellowship will provide the rigorous training, including coursework and seminars/workshops, interaction with stroke neurologists and epidemiologists and hands-on training in population-based studies and laboratory methods, needed to develop the applicant from a doctoral student to an independent investigator who will devote her research career to the study of stroke and its determinants, including infection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic infectious pathogens have been proposed as risk factors for stroke, but current evidence is inconclusive. As chronic infections are highly prevalent in Mexican Americans, this risk factor may be particularly important for this population which is vulnerable to stroke.

"REGARDS - MI Study BACKGROUND. As for stroke, geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality are recognized but poorly understood. NIH (NINDS) funded the Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study to follow 30,000 individuals(age >44; 1/2 African American, 1/2 European American; 1/2 female; 1/2 from the stroke belt/ buckle areas) over 3.5 years for stroke incidence and mortality. SPECIFIC AIMS. The overall goal of the REGARDS-MI Ancillary Study is to capitalize on a narrow window of opportunity to leverage REGARD'S infrastructure by quantifying geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality, attack rates (new and recurrent hospitalized acute CHD and pre-hospital CHD death in the population) and case fatality (among those with an acute CHD event, death within 28 days). Our Specific Aims are to (1) estimate US geographic- and ethnic-specificrates of CHD mortality, attack rates, and case fatality; (2) study the relationshipbetween US geographic- and ethnic-specific attack rates and variation in the prevalence of CHD risk factors; and (3) study the relationship between US geographic- andethnic-specific CHD case fatality and socioeconomic factors, medical care and CHD risk factors. METHODS. We will retrieve medical records for all heart-related hospitalizations(-6000) among REGARDS participants and collect data on all deaths (-500). We will adjudicatehospitalizations and deaths for CHD, collect cardiac procedures and medications, and merge this with extensive data already being collected by REGARDS. Using multivariable multi-levelanalyses, we will test 10 specific hypotheses. IMPLICATIONS. This will be the first nationwidestudy to relate CHD attack rate and case fatality, including pre-hospital deaths, to geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality. REGARDS offers aunique opportunity to attain our specific aims without the massive participant recruitment and follow-up costs that otherwise would be necessary. There is no budgetary overlap between REGARDS and REGARDS-MI as REGARDS focuses only on potential strokes. Our results will contribute significantlyto the knowledge base essential for attaining the Healthy People 2010 goal of reducing health disparities.

"Regional & Racial Differences in Hemostasis & Risk of Stroke & Heart Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a 5-year research and training program for Dr. Neil A. Zakai (a junior faculty member at the University of Vermont) to develop an independent career in vascular epidemiology by investigating the impact hemostatic biomarker levels have on regional and racial differences in stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) in the 30,228 black and white individuals in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study (REGARDS).  Dr. Mary Cushman, an internationally recognized investigator in cardiovascular epidemiology, will serve as the principle mentor for this project. Though the period of this study, Dr. Cushman will support the educational and research aspects of this project. The advisory committee was selected from experts in epidemiology, neurology, and hematology to provide the best opportunities for networking and future collaborations. Dr. Zakai will meet with the advisory committee both in person and through teleconferences on a monthly basis. To achieve a future independent research career for Dr. Zakai, we propose specific coursework in epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Vermont and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  The project will be a case-cohort study focusing on the impact of multiple hemostatic biomarkers (both individually and in groups) on the regional and racial differences in stroke and CHD incidence in the United States. The specific aims will 1) create the nested case-cohort study within REGARDS, 2) use multivariable modeling and factor analysis to elucidate mechanisms for stroke and CHD and 3) integrate hemostatic biomarkers and traditional CVD risk factors into a model for stroke and CHD risk that can account for racial and/or regional differences in CVD.  The Laboratory for Clinical and Biochemical Research at the University of Vermont serves as an ideal setting to conduct this research by bringing together the laboratory aspects and the epidemiological expertise to ensure a rich translational research experience.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are regional and racial differences in coronary heart disease and stroke not explained by conventional cardiovascular risk factors.

"Stroke Incidence and Risk Factors in a Tri-Ethnic Region    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke and cognitive impairment remain a major public health problem with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. The reasons for these race-ethnic disparities are not entirely clear. Improved detection and control of novel stroke risk factors are needed to reduce vascular disease burden. The Northern Manhattan prospective cohort consists of a population-based cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults enrolled since 2001 who have been followed annually for stroke, MI, and death. This collaborative study now involves faculty across 2 academic institutions and is the first prospective cohort study among whites, blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community. Over the last 5 years, the aims have expanded to include subclinical carotid, cardiac, and brain measures. High-resolution carotid imaging data has been assembled on 1770 subjects and a neuropsychological battery and standardized brain MRI will be completed on 1300 subjects with quantitative analyses to measure white matter hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds. This grant supports continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke, MI, and vascular death) and adiponectin, a new marker of obesity, new measures of subclinical carotid disease (carotid plaque area and densitometry), and quantitative MRI measures of vascular subclinical brain disease, as well as evaluate the impact on cognitive decline. To accomplish these aims, stored baseline plasma will be used to measure fasting adiponectin levels. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be quantitatively analyzed from standardized digital recordings. Repeat neuro-psychological testing emphasizing frontal-executive domains will be done on 1105 subjects. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive for any vascular event. Community stroke surveillance will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. The strengths of this cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of traditional and emerging risk factors, and the innovative assessment of MRI subclinical disease and carotid subclinical disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and coronary heart disease comprise two of the top three leading causes of death in the US and are of increasing importance in developing countries. While heart disease is the leading cause of death, stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. Stroke continues to have a disproportionate impact on mortality for blacks compared to whites. The aging and rapid growth of the black and Hispanic population has the potential to lead to future increases in the public health impact of stroke and vascular disease. The economic burden in the US due to stroke among Hispanics and blacks from 2005 to 2050 is projected to be $313 billion for Hispanics, and $379 billion for blacks.       Race-ethnic disparities are driven by differences in stroke incidence and vascular risk factors and have remained significant even after accounting for differences in socioeconomic status. Healthy People 2010 called for an elimination of race-ethnic disparities, but did not provide a clear method to achieve this lofty goal.       The principal goals of our study are to help fill the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of stroke and vascular disease particularly among blacks and Hispanics in order to improve future prevention efforts. We have broadened our focus to investigate markers of obesity, subclinical disease measures of the carotid arteries and brain, and predictors of vascular cognitive impairment and decline. We need to understand the importance of these conditions in predicting stroke, MI, vascular death, and determining cognitive decline among minority populations.             ",Stroke Incidence and

"Development of a Cardiovascular Surveillance System in the CVRN    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will establish a surveillance system for cardiovascular disease in approximately 11 million health maintenance organization (HMO) members. The surveillance system will be initially established for coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure (HF), and stroke. The broad goals of this project are to:  1. Establish a surveillance system for coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure (HF) and stroke in the 15 centers of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) funded Cardiovascular Disease Research Network including therapeutic interventions, post-event outcomes and important risk factors and confounders.  2. Work collaboratively to establish and implement an aggregate database incorporating coronary  heart disease CHD, HF, and stroke data from all 15 CVRN sites that can be used by CVRN  investigators and other qualified research scientists to conduct studies related to comparative  effectiveness and health disparities.  3. Identify standard criteria for coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke clinical outcomes, as well as all components noted in goal #1 to enable data aggregation 4. Determine the most recent 10-year trends in the rates of acute myocardial infarction and stroke hospitalization and their relationship to trends in risk factors, co-morbidities, therapeutic  interventions, medications, and diagnostic modalities.  5. Demonstrate that the data can be used to address research questions regarding comparative effectiveness and novel methods of monitoring health disparities, areas that have been identified as RC2 topics by NHLBI. This project will result in a surveillance system in a consortium of 15 geographically diverse health plans that provide health care to about 11 million people, nearly 4% of the U.S. population. This surveillance system will be significantly larger than other existing cardiovascular surveillance efforts in the U.S. and includes a population that is diverse in race/ethnicity and sociodemographic characteristics. The surveillance system will include for CHD, HF, and stroke electronically available data on risk factors, co-morbidities, prescription medications, therapeutic interventions, and laboratory testing, and physician and patient characteristics. These data can be utilized to provide timely surveillance reports for CHD, CF, and stroke; a comprehensive description of a patient's longitudinal course both prior to and subsequent to development of CHD, CF, and stroke; and enable research questions to be addressed that assess the relationship of these variables to the course of disease as well as to address research questions relating to comparative effectiveness and to disparities in medical treatment and outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will establish a large database of information about heart disease and stroke in about 11 million members of 15 HMO providers of comprehensive medical care.

"Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Geographic and racial disparities in stroke mortality have existed for over 50 years with an incremental annual cost of $4.6 billion. Many causes for these disparities have been proposed, but existing research has inadequately addressed these, and interventions have failed to reduce their magnitude. Further, national data are not available describing the prevalence of cognitive decline, a problem largely caused by cerebrovascular disease and its risk factors. With completion of recruitment, baseline evaluation and follow-up of a national cohort of 30,000 black and white community dwelling participants, the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study is uniquely positioned to test older but unsubstantiated hypotheses explaining race/region disparities, to assess new evidence-based hypotheses, and to provide the first national data on predictors of cognitive decline. In this continuation application we propose to continue follow-up for incident stroke and cognitive decline among this cohort, which will quadruple the number of observed stroke events arid provide longitudinal data on cognitive decline. These data will provide the opportunity to investigate the underlying causes of the disparities in stroke mortality by assessing the role of confounding factors to mediate the observed excess risk among African Americans and Southerners, and to develop risk functions for relatively rare stroke subtypes including ICH and SAH. Preliminary analysis from REGARDS suggests that there is a-""cognitive decline belt"" that is concordant with the Stroke belt. The data from the continuation will allow a refinement of the description of these disparities, and, using similar analysis approaches employed for the stroke outcomes, will provide insights into the causes for these disparities. Finally, we will investigate the role of cognitive decline as a predictor for subsequent stroke events. Completion of these aims will allow for development of interventions to eliminate disparities in the incidence of stroke and cognitive decline. Implementation of specific interventions customized for black and white populations, and by region of the United States, may reduce health disparities in stroke recognition and treatment, risk factor prevention, and optimal management of existing risk factors.           ",Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke,7748980,U01NS041588,"['geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cognitive ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Alabama ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Insulin ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Insulin (ox), 8A-L-threonine-10A-L-isoleucine-30B-L-threonine- ', ' Humulin R ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Laboratories ', ' insight ', ' Louisiana ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Mississippi ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' North Carolina ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' programs ', ' South Carolina ', ' Arkansas ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ', ' SAH ', ' cognitive function ', ' Tennessee ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' vasculopathy ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Brain Infarction ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement component C1s ', ' Complement 1s ', ' Complement 1 Esterase ', ' C1s ', ' C1 s ', ' C1 Esterase ', ' C 1 Esterase ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' evidence base ', ' biomarker ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2010,5610830,0.31657242720705664
"Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the highly successful Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project. BASIC is the only ongoing stroke surveillance project focusing on Mexican Americans. Mexican Americans are the largest segment of the Hispanic American population, the United States' largest minority group. Since the inception of this project in January 2000, we have assembled a cohort of over 4,992 cerebrovascular disease patients for whom we are able to follow for recurrent cerebrovascular events as well as mortality. This gives us tremendous power to detect associations with biological and social risk factors for stroke, important to Mexican Americans as well as the broader United States population. We have demonstrated increased stroke incidence and recurrence in Mexican Americans. Stroke severity and ischemic stroke subtypes are similar between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Mortality following stroke appears to be less in Mexican Americans. In the next five years we are positioned to delineate trends in stroke rates, and to explore the potential reasons for the increased stroke burden in Mexican Americans, as well as their improved survival. This information will be critically important to all populations to reduce the devastation of stroke. We will continue to make important observations useful for planning delivery of stroke care in communities. For the first time we will investigate functional and cognitive outcome following stroke in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We will now also study the role of health care quality and medication compliance on stroke outcomes. We will collect blood on all stroke patients useful for genetic studies by our group and others, and we have initiated stroke surveillance in a similar community within Mexico that will serve as a great basis for comparison to the Corpus Christi population. BASIC has been a very prolific study with more than 27 original peer-reviewed publications in the last four years alone. Indeed, this study is just beginning to provide the rich epidemiologic and clinical data that are necessary to control the epidemic of cerebrovascular disease in Mexican Americans. We know that the next five years will allow us to make contributions that will be directly useful for interventions to reduce health disparities, prevent stroke and improve stroke outcomes in all populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a competitive renewal for the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project. This highly successful community-based stroke epidemiology project seeks to understand the health disparity for stroke among Mexican Americans and non Hispanic whites in Corpus Christi, Texas.

"Ethnic Differences in the Risk of Fracture and Vascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The career objective of the K23 candidate is to become a rheumatic disease epidemiologist. In the context of mentored research, Dr. Curtis will examine the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes related to osteoporosis, with an emphasis on African Americans and men. To achieve this objective, Dr. Curtis has designed a didactic training program to augment his methodologic skills in analytic techniques relevant to large longitudinal studies. With supervision of experienced mentors, Dr. Curtis will obtain hands-on training in the conduct and analysis of an ancillary study to the 4 year R01 ""Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke"" study funded by the NINDS enrolling 30,000 African Americans and Caucasians. Although typically at lower risk for fractures than Caucasian women, African Americans and men suffer greater post-fracture morbidity and mortality. The ability to estimate absolute fracture risk among men and non-Caucasians is limited since these persons are relatively underrepresented in osteoporosis cohorts. Prior fracture appears to be an independent risk for subsequent stroke and myocardial infarction (Ml), but the association between bone and vascular disease in high risk, understudied populations is poorly understood. The specific aims of the K23 project are 1) Define ethnic/racial differences in relative and absolute fracture incidence over 4 years in 3 high risk groups (prevalent fracture; prior stroke; glucocorticoid use) compared to the overall cohort; 2) Determine ethnic/racial differences in stroke and Ml risk among those with prevalent fracture. Survival analysis will compare rates and risk factors for first and recurrent fractures and vascular events by ethnicity/race and gender. Shared risk factors for both bone and vascular disease will be examined in several secondary hypotheses based on an ancillary questionnaire sent to the entire cohort. Data generated from this project will provide a framework for future research proposals. Better understanding of the absolute and relative hazards associated with risk factors for fracture and associated vascular events in African Americans and men may lead to improved understanding of the underlying biology and help reduce ethnic/racial and gender-related disparities in osteoporosis care.

"REGARDS - MI Study BACKGROUND. As for stroke, geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality are recognized but poorly understood. NIH (NINDS) funded the Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study to follow 30,000 individuals(age >44; 1/2 African American, 1/2 European American; 1/2 female; 1/2 from the stroke belt/ buckle areas) over 3.5 years for stroke incidence and mortality. SPECIFIC AIMS. The overall goal of the REGARDS-MI Ancillary Study is to capitalize on a narrow window of opportunity to leverage REGARD'S infrastructure by quantifying geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality, attack rates (new and recurrent hospitalized acute CHD and pre-hospital CHD death in the population) and case fatality (among those with an acute CHD event, death within 28 days). Our Specific Aims are to (1) estimate US geographic- and ethnic-specificrates of CHD mortality, attack rates, and case fatality; (2) study the relationshipbetween US geographic- and ethnic-specific attack rates and variation in the prevalence of CHD risk factors; and (3) study the relationship between US geographic- andethnic-specific CHD case fatality and socioeconomic factors, medical care and CHD risk factors. METHODS. We will retrieve medical records for all heart-related hospitalizations(-6000) among REGARDS participants and collect data on all deaths (-500). We will adjudicatehospitalizations and deaths for CHD, collect cardiac procedures and medications, and merge this with extensive data already being collected by REGARDS. Using multivariable multi-levelanalyses, we will test 10 specific hypotheses. IMPLICATIONS. This will be the first nationwidestudy to relate CHD attack rate and case fatality, including pre-hospital deaths, to geographic and ethnic variations in CHD mortality. REGARDS offers aunique opportunity to attain our specific aims without the massive participant recruitment and follow-up costs that otherwise would be necessary. There is no budgetary overlap between REGARDS and REGARDS-MI as REGARDS focuses only on potential strokes. Our results will contribute significantlyto the knowledge base essential for attaining the Healthy People 2010 goal of reducing health disparities.

"Stroke Incidence and Risk Factors in a Tri-Ethnic Region    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke and cognitive impairment remain a major public health problem with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. The reasons for these race-ethnic disparities are not entirely clear. Improved detection and control of novel stroke risk factors are needed to reduce vascular disease burden. The Northern Manhattan prospective cohort consists of a population-based cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults enrolled since 2001 who have been followed annually for stroke, MI, and death. This collaborative study now involves faculty across 2 academic institutions and is the first prospective cohort study among whites, blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community. Over the last 5 years, the aims have expanded to include subclinical carotid, cardiac, and brain measures. High-resolution carotid imaging data has been assembled on 1770 subjects and a neuropsychological battery and standardized brain MRI will be completed on 1300 subjects with quantitative analyses to measure white matter hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds. This grant supports continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke, MI, and vascular death) and adiponectin, a new marker of obesity, new measures of subclinical carotid disease (carotid plaque area and densitometry), and quantitative MRI measures of vascular subclinical brain disease, as well as evaluate the impact on cognitive decline. To accomplish these aims, stored baseline plasma will be used to measure fasting adiponectin levels. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be quantitatively analyzed from standardized digital recordings. Repeat neuro-psychological testing emphasizing frontal-executive domains will be done on 1105 subjects. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive for any vascular event. Community stroke surveillance will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. The strengths of this cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of traditional and emerging risk factors, and the innovative assessment of MRI subclinical disease and carotid subclinical disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and coronary heart disease comprise two of the top three leading causes of death in the US and are of increasing importance in developing countries. While heart disease is the leading cause of death, stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. Stroke continues to have a disproportionate impact on mortality for blacks compared to whites. The aging and rapid growth of the black and Hispanic population has the potential to lead to future increases in the public health impact of stroke and vascular disease. The economic burden in the US due to stroke among Hispanics and blacks from 2005 to 2050 is projected to be $313 billion for Hispanics, and $379 billion for blacks.       Race-ethnic disparities are driven by differences in stroke incidence and vascular risk factors and have remained significant even after accounting for differences in socioeconomic status. Healthy People 2010 called for an elimination of race-ethnic disparities, but did not provide a clear method to achieve this lofty goal.       The principal goals of our study are to help fill the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of stroke and vascular disease particularly among blacks and Hispanics in order to improve future prevention efforts. We have broadened our focus to investigate markers of obesity, subclinical disease measures of the carotid arteries and brain, and predictors of vascular cognitive impairment and decline. We need to understand the importance of these conditions in predicting stroke, MI, vascular death, and determining cognitive decline among minority populations.             ",Stroke Incidence and

"Effects of early exercise on muscle and cardiovascular health after stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke leads to profound physical deconditioning and abnormalities in paretic leg muscle including shift to fast twitch muscle phenotype, inflammation and gross atrophy that worsen cardiometabolic health by promoting insulin resistance. Yet, no prior studies have considered stroke as a catabolic syndrome in aging that can be modified by early exercise to improve muscle and cardiometabolic health. In chronic stroke, we have exercise models that improve mobility, restore fitness levels nearly 40%, and reverse impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and T2DM status in 58% of cases, even years after stroke. Lab findings suggest our exercise programs increase total myofibrillar protein and proportion of slow twitch in paretic leg muscle, implicating both altered protein synthesis and regulation of muscle molecular phenotype as mechanisms underlying the benefits of exercise post-stroke. This study investigates the hypothesis that in African-Jamaican adults with recent stroke, structured exercise across the sub-acute recovery period and into the chronic phase of stroke care will improve P leg muscle and cardiometabolic health, compared to controls receiving best medical care. Aims and associated hypotheses are to compare effects of 6 months structured and progressive exercise vs. best medical care implemented early after stroke in African-Jamaican adults on: Aim #1. Paretic & non-paretic leg mixed muscle protein synthesis and breakdown in the fed and fasted state, TNF-1 expression, thigh muscle volume and strength. Hypothesis 1: Paretic leg muscle has reduced protein synthesis and increased breakdown compared to non- paretic leg; Exercise will increase mixed muscle protein synthesis and reduce breakdown to increase muscle volume and strength by mechanism(s) of reducing inflammation in paretic leg, compared to controls. Aim #2. Glucose tolerance, fitness, and muscle phenotype. Hypothesis 2: Exercise will improve fitness levels, insulin and glucose response to oral glucose challenge, and increase paretic leg slow twitch muscle phenotype.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic hemiparetic stroke is associated changes in body composition, skeletal muscle and cardiometabolic health; specific changes include paretic limb muscular atrophy, increased intramuscular fat deposition, elevated prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. This randomized intervention study compares a 6 month task oriented exercise programs versus control with both groups receiving best medical stroke care according to American Stroke Association ""Get with the Guidelines"". The hypothesis is that is 6 months of task-oriented exercise initiated early across the sub-acute period of stroke can prevent or ameliorate the natural course of these body composition, skeletal muscle and cardiometabolic health changes.           Chronic hemiparetic stroke is associated changes in body composition, skeletal muscle and cardiometabolic health; specific changes include paretic limb muscular atrophy, increased intramuscular fat deposition, elevated prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes.

"Ethnic/Racial Variation in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) occurs when a blood vessel ruptures within the brain parenchyma leading to neurologic injury and frequently death. Approximately 40-50% of patients who suffer from an ICH will die from the hemorrhage. Of the survivors, the majority are disabled. Thus, ICH is the subtype of stroke with the highest morbidity and mortality rates. Minority populations of African-Americans and Hispanics have been found to have roughly double the rate of ICH as whites and on average, have ICH at a younger age. Yet despite this disproportionate health care burden, fewer than 200 ICH cases among African-Americans and less than a hundred ICH cases among Hispanics have been collected with DNA available for testing. Our proposal is to collect 1000 cases of ICH among whites, 1000 cases of ICH among blacks, 1000 cases of ICH among Hispanics, and 3000 controls matched to the cases by race/ethnicity, age (5 years), gender and geographic location. Our long-term goal is to perform a genome-wide association study of intracerebral hemorrhage which includes a significant proportion of minorities with ICH. A genome-wide association study evaluates DNA with hundreds of thousands of markers to identify regions or genes which are associated with either a greater or lesser risk of ICH. However, the current proposal will not complete this type of analysis as insufficient numbers are currently available. Thus, the goals of the current proposal are to: 1) understand the risk factors of greatest importance for ICH among blacks and Hispanics; 2) determine differences in brain-imaging by race/ethnicity; 3) determine factors that mediate differences in outcomes rates by race/ethnicity; and 4) determine if Hispanics and African-Americans from different regions or national origin (such as Mexican, Cuban, etc.) are genetically different. To accomplish these goals, we have 11 recruitment centers representing 30 recruitment hospitals throughout the United States with large populations of African-Americans and Hispanics. White ICH cases from the same regions will also be recruited to account for regional differences in risk factors as well as a comparison group for risk factors, outcomes and imaging differences. A centralized neuroimaging center will be developed for uniform reading and analysis of films at Massachusetts General Hospital in conjunction with Georgetown University. A biorepository will be developed for centralized DNA processing and sample handling at the Miami Institute for Human Genomics. And a data and statistical center will be developed at Wake Forest University. The major advantages of this study are the experience of the investigators, particularly with recruitment of minority populations and particular interest in ICH and epidemiology; uniform definitions of cases, risk factors, and centralized analyses; and the ability to identify and recruit the large number of subjects (6000 total) required for the study.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability among adults. More people are disabled by stroke than Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, cancer or AIDS. Intracerebral hemorrhage is the type of stroke with the highest death and disability rates. ICH occurs in 70,000 Americans every year and a single year of ICH cases in the United States leads to approximately $3.7 billion dollars of health care costs. African-Americans and Hispanics have twice the rate of this type of stroke than whites do and have this type of stroke at an earlier age in life. Yet we know little about the biologic differences that lead to this ethnic disparity. Our proposal will compare minorities with ICH to controls from the same population as well as explore genetic,   radiographic and outcomes differences.           Study Relevance:  Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability among adults.

"Regional & Racial Differences in Hemostasis & Risk of Stroke & Heart Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a 5-year research and training program for Dr. Neil A. Zakai (a junior faculty member at the University of Vermont) to develop an independent career in vascular epidemiology by investigating the impact hemostatic biomarker levels have on regional and racial differences in stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) in the 30,228 black and white individuals in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study (REGARDS).  Dr. Mary Cushman, an internationally recognized investigator in cardiovascular epidemiology, will serve as the principle mentor for this project. Though the period of this study, Dr. Cushman will support the educational and research aspects of this project. The advisory committee was selected from experts in epidemiology, neurology, and hematology to provide the best opportunities for networking and future collaborations. Dr. Zakai will meet with the advisory committee both in person and through teleconferences on a monthly basis. To achieve a future independent research career for Dr. Zakai, we propose specific coursework in epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Vermont and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  The project will be a case-cohort study focusing on the impact of multiple hemostatic biomarkers (both individually and in groups) on the regional and racial differences in stroke and CHD incidence in the United States. The specific aims will 1) create the nested case-cohort study within REGARDS, 2) use multivariable modeling and factor analysis to elucidate mechanisms for stroke and CHD and 3) integrate hemostatic biomarkers and traditional CVD risk factors into a model for stroke and CHD risk that can account for racial and/or regional differences in CVD.  The Laboratory for Clinical and Biochemical Research at the University of Vermont serves as an ideal setting to conduct this research by bringing together the laboratory aspects and the epidemiological expertise to ensure a rich translational research experience.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are regional and racial differences in coronary heart disease and stroke not explained by conventional cardiovascular risk factors.

"Home-Based Automated Therapy of Arm Function After Stroke Via Tele-Rehabilitation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Constraint-Induced Movement therapy (CIMT) is one of few techniques that has been shown in controlled studies to produce large improvements in real-world arm function in stroke survivors with mild to moderate hemiparesis. The standard treatment involves one-on-one training of paretic arm use in the clinic for 3 hr/day for 10 consecutive weekdays and placing a mitt on the other hand to discourage its use. The considerable cost of CIMT, due to the demand on therapist time and requirement that patients travel daily to a clinic for 2 weeks, imposes substantial limits on those who might access the therapy. Our lab, with Peter Lum, Ph.D., has developed a device for automating the delivery of CIMT named AutoCITE; it permits practice of 8 upper- extremity tasks and provides frequent graphical performance feedback. Two reports indicate that AutoCITE is as efficacious as standard CIMT even with therapist effort reduced by 75%. A third report suggests that AutoCITE under simulated telerehabilitation conditions (i.e., patient and therapist were in different rooms in the lab) is also just as efficacious. We propose to modify AutoCITE so that it is more appropriate for use in patients' homes and evaluate its efficacy for providing CIMT on a telerehab basis. We will also specifically test whether making the AutoCITE software more interactive helps patients to comply with training at home, where there are more distractions. To this end, we will randomize 87 chronic stroke survivors to: 1. AutoCITE training in the home with two patients supervised concurrently by one therapist remotely via an Internet-based audio- visual link, 2. the same procedures except that the more interactive software will be run on AutoCITE, and 3. dose-matched, standard CIMT in the home. Motor outcomes and costs from the home-based, two-on-one, tele-AutoCITE groups will be compared to those from the home-based, one-on-one, in vivo CIMT group and to those from laboratory-based AutoCITE and standard CIMT groups run previously. If successful, AutoCITE, which involves simply automating task practice with actual objects and is much less expensive than prevailing virtual reality based approaches, might serve as a platform for delivering other upper-extremity therapies, in addition to CIMT, via telerehab. With about 300,000 new stroke survivors suffering motor disability annually, cutting the cost of and increasing access to efficacious upper-extremity rehabilitation has the potential to reduce disability significantly.

We have studied trends in stroke incidence and case fatality, as well as the prevalence of risk factors and knowledge of stroke (via a population survey) for almost 15 years and have demonstrated a racial disparity where stroke incidence in African-Americans is more than double that of whites. In addition to continuing these important activities, we propose an innovative pilot study that will be the largest prospective, population-based stroke outcomes study to date. The anticipated ~3,200 patients with strokes and 800 TIAs from our region in 2010, as well as the 2,000 surveyed participants, will be used to test the following hypotheses: 1. Temporal trends in the incidence rate of stroke will demonstrate a decrease over time in whites (as shown by our 2005 preliminary data). However, there will not be a similar decrease among blacks, a racial group that has not been examined in other temporal studies of stroke. We expect that case fatality rates will not change between periods, and will be similar for both blacks and whites. 2. A cohort of subjects followed by a regional HIE combined with phone-call follow-up will be more representative of the entire stroke population in our region than a cohort of subjects that agree to in-person interviews, which is likely to have participation and survival biases. Information obtained via this approach will be as valid as data from manual chart abstraction and direct interview for determining access to care and individual patients' functional outcome after stroke across a region, and will be more efficient to collect than that obtained via manual processes. 3. The proportion of the population that knows warning signs or risk factors for stroke will NOT improve between 2006 and 2011, based on our preliminary data. When subjects are asked about their own personal risk for stroke, a lower self-perceived risk will be associated with worse stroke knowledge. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The change in stroke occurrence over time is the ultimate test of how well science has translated new discoveries into benefits for the population. Our study has examined racial disparities in stroke over the last 15 years, showing that blacks have higher risk for stroke than whites. In our population, the occurrence of stroke is decreasing in whites but not African Americans, and we will continue to describe trends in stroke occurrence, cause, treatment, and outcome in a biracial metropolitan population.              RELEVANCE: The change in stroke occurrence over time is the ultimate test of how well science has translated new discoveries into benefits for the population.

"Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the highly successful Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project. BASIC is the only ongoing stroke surveillance project focusing on Mexican Americans. Mexican Americans are the largest segment of the Hispanic American population, the United States' largest minority group. Since the inception of this project in January 2000, we have assembled a cohort of over 4,992 cerebrovascular disease patients for whom we are able to follow for recurrent cerebrovascular events as well as mortality. This gives us tremendous power to detect associations with biological and social risk factors for stroke, important to Mexican Americans as well as the broader United States population. We have demonstrated increased stroke incidence and recurrence in Mexican Americans. Stroke severity and ischemic stroke subtypes are similar between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Mortality following stroke appears to be less in Mexican Americans. In the next five years we are positioned to delineate trends in stroke rates, and to explore the potential reasons for the increased stroke burden in Mexican Americans, as well as their improved survival. This information will be critically important to all populations to reduce the devastation of stroke. We will continue to make important observations useful for planning delivery of stroke care in communities. For the first time we will investigate functional and cognitive outcome following stroke in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We will now also study the role of health care quality and medication compliance on stroke outcomes. We will collect blood on all stroke patients useful for genetic studies by our group and others, and we have initiated stroke surveillance in a similar community within Mexico that will serve as a great basis for comparison to the Corpus Christi population. BASIC has been a very prolific study with more than 27 original peer-reviewed publications in the last four years alone. Indeed, this study is just beginning to provide the rich epidemiologic and clinical data that are necessary to control the epidemic of cerebrovascular disease in Mexican Americans. We know that the next five years will allow us to make contributions that will be directly useful for interventions to reduce health disparities, prevent stroke and improve stroke outcomes in all populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a competitive renewal for the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project. This highly successful community-based stroke epidemiology project seeks to understand the health disparity for stroke among Mexican Americans and non Hispanic whites in Corpus Christi, Texas. This accomplished through observational epidemiology and interviews of patients.

"Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Geographic and racial disparities in stroke mortality have existed for over 50 years with an incremental annual cost of $4.6 billion. Many causes for these disparities have been proposed, but existing research has inadequately addressed these, and interventions have failed to reduce their magnitude. Further, national data are not available describing the prevalence of cognitive decline, a problem largely caused by cerebrovascular disease and its risk factors. With completion of recruitment, baseline evaluation and follow-up of a national cohort of 30,000 black and white community dwelling participants, the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study is uniquely positioned to test older but unsubstantiated hypotheses explaining race/region disparities, to assess new evidence-based hypotheses, and to provide the first national data on predictors of cognitive decline. In this continuation application we propose to continue follow-up for incident stroke and cognitive decline among this cohort, which will quadruple the number of observed stroke events arid provide longitudinal data on cognitive decline. These data will provide the opportunity to investigate the underlying causes of the disparities in stroke mortality by assessing the role of confounding factors to mediate the observed excess risk among African Americans and Southerners, and to develop risk functions for relatively rare stroke subtypes including ICH and SAH. Preliminary analysis from REGARDS suggests that there is a-""cognitive decline belt"" that is concordant with the Stroke belt. The data from the continuation will allow a refinement of the description of these disparities, and, using similar analysis approaches employed for the stroke outcomes, will provide insights into the causes for these disparities. Finally, we will investigate the role of cognitive decline as a predictor for subsequent stroke events. Completion of these aims will allow for development of interventions to eliminate disparities in the incidence of stroke and cognitive decline. Implementation of specific interventions customized for black and white populations, and by region of the United States, may reduce health disparities in stroke recognition and treatment, risk factor prevention, and optimal management of existing risk factors.           ",Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke,8039970,U01NS041588,"['Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Tennessee ', ' Documentation ', ' North Carolina ', ' South Carolina ', ' Mississippi ', ' cognitive change ', ' Arkansas ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Alabama ', ' Brain Infarction ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ', ' SAH ', ' Process ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Participant ', ' cohort ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' cognitive function ', ' Communities ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Outcome ', ' Event ', ' Risk ', ' Funding ', ' Cognitive ', ' Prevention ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' insight ', ' Laboratories ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Prevalence ', ' Pattern ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Health ', ' Performance ', ' cost ', ' biomarker ', ' Incidence ', ' Mediating ', ' Age ', ' Measures ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Data ', ' Address ', ' Sampling ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Biological ', ' Future ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' improved ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Time ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' interest ', ' Link ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Research ', ' Measurement ', ' Modification ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Population ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Evaluation ', ' repository ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' vasculopathy ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' High Prevalence ', ' evidence base ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Insulin ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Insulin (ox), 8A-L-threonine-10A-L-isoleucine-30B-L-threonine- ', ' Humulin R ', ' Louisiana ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2011,9163546,0.31657242720705664
"Stroke Health and Risk Education (SHARE)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is a disease with tremendous individual, family, and societal impact. It is the number one cause of adult disability and third leading cause of death in the United States. Between now and the year 2050, the cost of stroke in the United States will exceed 2 trillion dollars. There is a tremendous ethnic disparity with respect to stroke in the United States. Mexican Americans are much more likely to have a stroke compared with European Americans. In Mexican Americans strokes occur at younger ages, are more likely to recur and have the same severity as they do in European Americans. Mexican Americans are the overwhelming largest sub- population of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority group. This proposal, a scientifically-based rigorous behavioral education intervention trial, seeks to aggressively prevent stroke, especially in Mexican Americans. Faith and family are strong components of Mexican American culture. This project works with these positive fundamental elements in order to affect stroke prevention. This project will take place in Nueces County, Texas. The project investigators have worked in this community for the past 14 years and have published extensively regarding the stroke health disparity in this stable, non-immigrant community of Mexican Americans and European Americans. We have established a strong partnership with the Catholic Diocese of Corpus Christi and assembled a team with tremendous experience at successful health behavior intervention research. Together, a proposal has been crafted that will directly speak to aggressive stroke risk factor reduction in Mexican Americans and European Americans in this representative United States community. The significance of such research is tremendous. As the Mexican American population grows and ages, the stroke impact will be felt with greater and greater intensity. Now is the time to develop aggressive, scientifically tested interventions to limit the burden of this disease on this important segment of the United States population, and to reduce the costs of this disease to the country as a whole, in keeping with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) goal to ""identify culturally appropriate, effective stroke prevention programs for nationwide implementation in minority communities"" by FY2010. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mexican Americans, the largest sub-population of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority group, have a higher risk of stroke than non-Hispanic whites.

"Home-Based Automated Therapy of Arm Function After Stroke Via Tele-Rehabilitation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Constraint-Induced Movement therapy (CIMT) is one of few techniques that has been shown in controlled studies to produce large improvements in real-world arm function in stroke survivors with mild to moderate hemiparesis. The standard treatment involves one-on-one training of paretic arm use in the clinic for 3 hr/day for 10 consecutive weekdays and placing a mitt on the other hand to discourage its use. The considerable cost of CIMT, due to the demand on therapist time and requirement that patients travel daily to a clinic for 2 weeks, imposes substantial limits on those who might access the therapy. Our lab, with Peter Lum, Ph.D., has developed a device for automating the delivery of CIMT named AutoCITE; it permits practice of 8 upper- extremity tasks and provides frequent graphical performance feedback. Two reports indicate that AutoCITE is as efficacious as standard CIMT even with therapist effort reduced by 75%. A third report suggests that AutoCITE under simulated telerehabilitation conditions (i.e., patient and therapist were in different rooms in the lab) is also just as efficacious. We propose to modify AutoCITE so that it is more appropriate for use in patients' homes and evaluate its efficacy for providing CIMT on a telerehab basis. We will also specifically test whether making the AutoCITE software more interactive helps patients to comply with training at home, where there are more distractions. To this end, we will randomize 87 chronic stroke survivors to: 1. AutoCITE training in the home with two patients supervised concurrently by one therapist remotely via an Internet-based audio- visual link, 2. the same procedures except that the more interactive software will be run on AutoCITE, and 3. dose-matched, standard CIMT in the home. Motor outcomes and costs from the home-based, two-on-one, tele-AutoCITE groups will be compared to those from the home-based, one-on-one, in vivo CIMT group and to those from laboratory-based AutoCITE and standard CIMT groups run previously. If successful, AutoCITE, which involves simply automating task practice with actual objects and is much less expensive than prevailing virtual reality based approaches, might serve as a platform for delivering other upper-extremity therapies, in addition to CIMT, via telerehab. With about 300,000 new stroke survivors suffering motor disability annually, cutting the cost of and increasing access to efficacious upper-extremity rehabilitation has the potential to reduce disability significantly.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Our laboratory, in collaboration with Peter Lum, Ph.D., has developed a device for automating the delivery of Constraint-Induced Movement therapy (CI therapy) named AutoCITE; it permits practice of 8 upper-extremity tasks and provides frequent graphical performance feedback. Two recently published studies suggest that AutoCITE is as efficacious as one-one-one CI therapy. Our proposed study will test the efficacy of the AutoCITE device to provide CI therapy on a tele-rehabilitation basis in patients' home. There are approximately 300,000 new strokes survivors with residual motor disability annually. Reducing the cost of and increasing access to efficacious upper-extremity rehabilitation has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of stroke on patients, their families and the healthcare system.       ",Home-Based Automated Therapy of Arm Function After Stroke Via Tele-Rehabilitation,8066595,R01HD053750,"['Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' Motivation ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Rest ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' feeding ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Publishing ', ' Text ', ' Visual ', ' Hour ', ' Names ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' sensor ', ' Procedures ', ' Simulate ', ' Dose ', ' Running ', ' Hand ', ' Supervision ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' prototype ', ' Control Groups ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Equipment ', ' Training ', ' cost ', ' Persons ', ' Motor ', ' Patients ', ' Link ', ' programs ', ' arm ', ' in vivo ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Family ', ' Devices ', ' Health ', ' Performance ', ' Clinic ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Outcome ', ' Monitor ', ' Participant ', ' Behavioral ', ' Testing ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Shapes ', ' Clinical ', ' Feedback ', ' Laboratories ', ' Collaborations ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Chronic ', ' Life ', ' Time ', ' Research ', ' Individual ', ' Accounting ', ' Techniques ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' base ', ' Data ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Affect ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Electronics ', ' Reporting ', ' disability ', ' Measures ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' motor deficit ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' distraction ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' telerehabilitation ', ' Hemipareses ', ' hemiparetic ', ' handicapping condition ', ' handicapping ', ' Infirmity ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' chronic stroke ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' constraint induced movement therapy ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Survivors ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Travel ', ' Automation ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Graph ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Limb structure ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' virtual reality ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2011,275970,0.2006927253836023
"Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Geographic and racial disparities in stroke mortality have existed for over 50 years with an incremental annual cost of $4.6 billion. Many causes for these disparities have been proposed, but existing research has inadequately addressed these, and interventions have failed to reduce their magnitude. Further, national data are not available describing the prevalence of cognitive decline, a problem largely caused by cerebrovascular disease and its risk factors. With completion of recruitment, baseline evaluation and follow-up of a national cohort of 30,000 black and white community dwelling participants, the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study is uniquely positioned to test older but unsubstantiated hypotheses explaining race/region disparities, to assess new evidence-based hypotheses, and to provide the first national data on predictors of cognitive decline. In this continuation application we propose to continue follow-up for incident stroke and cognitive decline among this cohort, which will quadruple the number of observed stroke events arid provide longitudinal data on cognitive decline. These data will provide the opportunity to investigate the underlying causes of the disparities in stroke mortality by assessing the role of confounding factors to mediate the observed excess risk among African Americans and Southerners, and to develop risk functions for relatively rare stroke subtypes including ICH and SAH. Preliminary analysis from REGARDS suggests that there is a-""cognitive decline belt"" that is concordant with the Stroke belt. The data from the continuation will allow a refinement of the description of these disparities, and, using similar analysis approaches employed for the stroke outcomes, will provide insights into the causes for these disparities. Finally, we will investigate the role of cognitive decline as a predictor for subsequent stroke events. Completion of these aims will allow for development of interventions to eliminate disparities in the incidence of stroke and cognitive decline. Implementation of specific interventions customized for black and white populations, and by region of the United States, may reduce health disparities in stroke recognition and treatment, risk factor prevention, and optimal management of existing risk factors.

"Caregiving and Health Care Utilization after Stroke among Medicare Beneficiaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States. Women and African Americans commonly have poorer functional outcomes after stroke, although the reasons for these gender and race differences are poorly understood. Some of the differential impact of stroke on women and African Americans might be explained by differential acute treatment and post-acute rehabilitative services, and by differential support of informal family caregivers. These factors have rarely been studied in representative population- based samples of stroke survivors. This application seeks funding to study these factors in a national sample of stroke survivors who are also Medicare beneficiaries. The Caring for Adults Recovering from the Effects of Stroke (CARES) study is an ancillary study of the national REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) project and is the only study of its kind that is systematically collecting long-term functional outcome data from the survivors of verified incident stroke events that are detected in a large-scale, prospective, epidemiologic investigation. Primary family caregivers are also enrolled in the CARES project, and to date, 210 stroke survivor/ family caregiver dyads have been enrolled. Most of these stroke survivors (N = 183, 87%) are traditional Medicare beneficiaires for whom Medicare claims data for the acute hospitalization and post-acute rehabilitative or recovery phase are available. Stroke survivor functional outcomes are assessed during structured in-home evaluations approximately one year after the incident stroke events, and stroke survivor and family caregiver psychosocial functioning and quality of life are assessed with structured telephone interviews beginning 9 months after the incident stroke event and continuing up to 3 years after the stroke event. As part of this proposed extension to the CARES project, we will expand our inclusion criteria to include more stroke survivors, including those without family caregivers, and our total sample size will increase to 420 stroke survivors, including 365 who are also traditional Medicare beneficiaries. While continuing to study outcome disparities among all stroke survivors, new specific aims are advanced in this proposal that focus on measures of health care utilization from the Medicare claims data. Most of the previous studies on care utilization after stroke and the long-term outcomes of stroke have not assessed the influences or experiences of informal family caregivers, and we hypothesize that differences in caregiver availability and involvement will partially explain previously observed gender and race differences in care utilization and functional outcomes. The CARES project is uniquely positioned to link demographic variables, stroke severity measures, post-stroke care utilization patterns, informal caregiving factors, and long-term functional outcomes in ways that will add new knowledge to the literature on why women and African Americans have poorer outcomes after stroke. The project will also advance our general understanding of how stroke affects both patients and their families more broadly.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is a common medical problem for older adults. Most of the formal rehabilitative care after stroke is covered by traditional Medicare claims, and most stroke patients also receive considerable informal care from close family members. The proposed research will examine the links between informal caregiving support, formal care utilization, and long-term stroke outcomes using a national epidemiologic sample. Caregiving supports during the acute hospitalization and post-acute rehabilitative phases are expected to differ by race and gender, and to partially account for previously observed race and gender differences in outcomes.           Stroke is a common medical problem for older adults.

"Infection and Stroke in Mexican Americans Stroke is the third leading cause of death and leading cause of disability in adults in the US. Nearly 800,000 people suffer a stroke annually, and more than 143,000 deaths occur as a result. Hispanic Americans are the fastest growing minority population in the US, as well as the most numerous. The majority of Hispanic Americans are of Mexican descent. Mexican Americans (MAs) have an increased risk of stroke especially at younger ages when disability has the greatest impact. Reasons for increased stroke risk in MAs are not fully understood but traditional risk factors are not likely to fully account for the increased stroke burden in this population. Chronic infectious pathogens have been proposed as risk factors for stroke and for poor stroke outcome, although the evidence remains inconclusive and studies have not been done in MAs. As chronic infections are more prevalent in MAs than their non-Hispanic white counterparts, this risk factor may be particularly important for this population. The proposed dissertation research seeks to examine the links between chronic infection and incident stroke and post-stroke functional outcome, among participants from the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA). This research will extend current knowledge of infection and stroke in several critical ways:1) by examining antibody response to several infectious agents versus infection serostatus as independent risk factors for stroke, 2) by examining the underlying mechanisms, including inflammatory pathways, by which antibody response may influence stroke risk, 3) by investigating the association of antibody response to post-stroke functional outcomes and 4) by focusing specifically in a MA population known to experience a greater stroke burden as well as a greater infection burden. The recognition that infection increases stroke risk after accounting for traditional risk factors may have important implications for the prevention of stroke in MAs and for reducing the stroke health disparity in this population. In addition to advancing the science in this critical area, the proposed fellowship will provide the rigorous training, including coursework and seminars/workshops, interaction with stroke neurologists and epidemiologists and hands-on training in population-based studies and laboratory methods, needed to develop the applicant from a doctoral student to an independent investigator who will devote her research career to the study of stroke and its determinants, including infection. Project Narrative  Chronic infectious pathogens have been proposed as risk factors for stroke, but current evidence is inconclusive. As chronic infections are highly prevalent in Mexican Americans, this risk factor may be particularly important for this population which is vulnerable to stroke.

"Effect of Statins and Modifiable Factors on Stroke Outcome in Atrial Fibrillation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the third leading cause of mortality and a leading cause of disability in the U.S. Cardioembolic strokes resulting from atrial fibrillation (AF) are particularly devastating, with a 30-day mortality of 25%. The number of individuals with AF is projected to reach 8 million by 2020, and will disproportionately burden the elderly. The challenge and paradox of AF is that many of the risk factors for stroke are also risk factors for hemorrhage, limiting the use of anticoagulant therapy among those at greatest risk. Patients enrolled in clinical trials often bear little resemblance to the higher risk patients in clinical practice making it difficult to extrapolate estimates of treatment efficacy and safety. Trial participants are younger, more often male, less medically complex, less symptomatic, and specifically selected for lower bleeding risk. Despite their greater burden of risk factors, minorities have constituted less than 5% of AF trial populations. Aspirin is a marginally effective therapy in AF and causes bleeding almost as frequently as anticoagulants, particularly in the elderly. For instance, the rate of intracranial hemorrhage has quintupled in recent years, due to expanded use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy in older adults; 46% are fatal. Preventive strategies without attendant bleeding risk are urgently needed to mitigate the impact of stroke in AF. Although proinflammatory stimuli like hyperglycemia, infection, accelerated hypertension, heart failure, and dyslipidemia are potent triggers for thrombin generation, their effect on AF stroke outcomes has not been studied. The anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties of HMG CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) provide a biological rationale to hypothesize reduced severity (size) of AF stroke. Experimental studies report reduced platelet deposition; platelet mediated thrombin generation, and reduced infarct volume. The relations among statins, modifiable and nonmodifiable stroke risk factors, antithrombotic therapy and AF stroke outcomes have yet to be elucidated. To address these knowledge gaps, we will assemble a large cohort of consecutive AF stroke admissions (ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage) from 2006-2010 (n=2,500, 35% underrepresented minority, 43% >75 years of age) from 3 strategic sites to address the following aims:  1. To determine AF stroke disability and 30-day case fatality by age, sex, race/ethnicity;  2. To examine the relation of acute prothrombotic inflammatory triggers on stroke severity in AF;  3. To study the associations of antithrombotic treatment, including statins, and risk factors to stroke  severity in AF. Our application will address these aims through the unique and complementary strengths of  the collaborating investigators and institutions: Boston Medical Center, University of Alabama, and Geisinger  Health System of Pennsylvania. Our application will inform critical knowledge gaps in AF stroke, target  strategies to mitigate stroke severity, and assess the relations of antithrombotic and statin therapy to stroke  outcomes across the spectrum of stroke risk among diverse AF patient populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reduction of stroke disability and racial/ethnic disparities in stroke deaths is a pressing U.S. health concern. Through this proposal, we aim to identify stroke prevention approaches for key underrepresented demographic subgroups.

"Stroke Disparities Program Acute stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the US. A disproportionate amount of morbidity and mortality falls on underserved populations. Reduction of health disparities has become a significant public health challenge and is a major goal of the Healthy People 2010 initiative. The programmatic goal of this proposal is to identify biological and socioeconomic factors contributing to ethnic disparities and to develop innovative approaches to reduce these disparities for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Three research projects are proposed. Project 1, Acute Stroke Program of Interventions addressing Racial and Ethnic disparities (ASPIRE), is an intervention study designed to investigate whether implementation of a multilevel intervention can significantly increase the number of ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) in a predominantly underserved community. The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of all ischemic stroke patients appropriately treated with IV tPA. Project 2, Preventing Recurrence of Thromboembolic Events through Coordinated Treatment in the District of Columbia (PROTECT DC) is a randomized phase II clinical trial of the PROTECT DC intervention (hospital-based initiation of aggressive secondary prevention combined with navigator case management) vs. standard management in ischemic stroke patients from two underserved hospitals in the District of Columbia. The primary aims are 1) to refine the PROTECT DC design in preparation for a phase INI trial and, 2) to assess the effect of the intervention on 4 medication goals as defined by normalization of objective measures of secondary risk factor control. Project 3, DiffErenCes in the Imaging of Primary Hemorrhage based on Ethnicity or Race (DECIPHER) is a longitudinal, MR imaging, prospective, observational, cohort study designed to evaluate the prevalence and significance by race/ethnicity of chronic cerebral microbleeds in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage. Three cores will support the projects: A) Administration B) Participant Recruitment, Retention, Intervention and Outcomes, and C) Biostatistics / Data Management. This application is designed not only to define factors leading to racial/ethnic disparities in stroke treatment and outcomes, but also to demonstrate the efficacy of programs specifically designed to reduce these disparities.

"Sleep apnea health disparities in Mexican American stroke patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the US and a leading cause of death. Mexican Americans (MA), the largest subgroup of Hispanic Americans, have a substantially higher stroke risk than European Americans, especially at younger ages where the risk is more than double. Given the greater risk and earlier onset, the impact of stroke is disproportionately experienced by MAs. Reasons for increased stroke risk in MAs are poorly understood. More than half of ischemic stroke patients have sleep apnea, a very common and important risk factor for stroke and potentially a risk factor for poor stroke outcome. No published studies have established the prevalence of sleep apnea in MAs to discern sleep apnea's contribution to excess stroke burden in this population. Small studies conducted in academic medical centers have suggested that stroke patients with sleep apnea have particularly poor stroke outcomes, but population-based studies in diverse populations are lacking. The current application seeks to investigate health disparities related to sleep apnea in stroke patients in order to understand the marked ethnic differences in stroke. This research will inform the development of interventions to prevent or treat sleep apnea in MAs, which will reduce the ethnic stroke disparity. The parent study for this project, the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project, is an ongoing population-based stroke surveillance study that identifies stroke cases in Nueces County, Texas. This study has made many important discoveries about stroke in Hispanics. BASIC will continue to identify all strokes in Nueces County until mid year 3 of the current application and will provide detailed 90-day stroke outcome data until mid year 2. The current application will extend BASIC data collection through year 5 month 3 and will add: (1) sleep apnea screening in the acute stroke period that differentiates obstructive from central events, (2) sleep apnea screening for intracerebral hemorrhage cases, (3) access to care measures for sleep apnea, and (4) genetic admixture analysis to investigate how genetics may relate to ethnic disparities in sleep apnea. The application seeks, in a cost-containing fashion, to understand and remedy the influence of a very frequent risk factor, sleep apnea, on a common, devastating disease, stroke, in the largest and fastest growing US minority population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep apnea is an important predictor of stroke and appears to be a predictor of poor outcomes after stroke. Using the preexisting infrastructure of the BASIC project, the current application will provide an assessment of health disparities related to sleep apnea in stroke patients. It will also allow for the rigorous study of ethnic comparisons of sleep apnea after stroke in European Americans and Hispanics, the largest minority in the United States.           Sleep apnea is an important predictor of stroke and appears to be a predictor of poor outcomes after stroke.

"Functional Impairment from Stroke: an Exploratory Study of Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding factors that determine long term outcomes after the onset of major medical conditions is key to identifying effective strategies to improve population health, reduce the prevalence of disability, and eliminate health disparities. Stroke is a leading cause of major disability in elderly Americans. Yet, research into pre- stroke social, contextual, or health characteristics that may reduce the consequences of stroke has been severely hampered by limitations in available data. Most of the preeminent stroke studies are regionally localized and/or initiate data collection upon hospitalization and diagnosis. Few data sources include nationwide samples of stroke survivors followed longitudinally from prior to stroke onset through the long-term recovery period. In data sets collected from only one or a few communities, it is impossible to test the effects of geographic or contextual risk factors on stroke outcomes, or to examine whether racial disparities are modified by such contextual factors. In studies that initiate enrollment at the onset of stroke, examining pre-stroke risk factors typically requires retrospective data collection. Without pre-stroke functional assessments, it is difficult to quantify how much of a functional decrement was induced by the stroke. Although it is difficult and expensive to collect medically verified stroke onset data in a national, prospective cohort, some already existing national longitudinal studies include self-reported stroke. The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is an ongoing, nationally representative study of Americans aged 50+ that routinely asks participants about history of stroke and other major medical conditions. Since inception, nearly 2,500 incident first strokes have been recorded for HRS participants, but the possibility of misreporting of stroke is a concern when using HRS data to study stroke outcomes. We propose three aims, 1) Quantify measurement error in self-reported incident strokes in the HRS, using linked Medicare claims records as a gold standard; 2) Examine national and regional racial disparities in the effects of stroke on mortality, cognitive impairments (assessed with word recall score and the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status), and physical limitations (instrumental and basic activities of daily living); and 3) Identify pre-stroke characteristics that modify the effects of stroke on health. This research builds on the extraordinary resources in HRS, which includes detailed socioeconomic measures and valuable longitudinal health data. This exploratory project would lay the groundwork for other applications of HRS data, including broader research on determinants of stroke incidence and post-stroke outcomes. These analyses will also provide a model for extensions to other self-reported medical conditions assessed in HRS, such as heart disease and diabetes, so future work could examine both risk factors for onset of these diseases and factors that determine level of functioning in the context of these conditions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to use data from the Health and Retirement Study, a national longitudinal study of Americans aged 50 and older, to study factors that improve people's functioning after stroke. First, we will compare the stroke records that study participants describe in interviews to their records from Medicare claims. Second, we will look to see if stroke affects black and white patients similarly. Third, we will test whether socioeconomic resources or other characteristics measured before stroke onset reduce the consequences of stroke on survival, memory and cognitive functioning, or physical independence.           Narrative We propose to use data from the Health and Retirement Study, a national longitudinal study of Americans aged 50 and older, to study factors that improve people's functioning after stroke.

"Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to continue our population-based study of stroke incidence, risk factors, treatment, and outcome of stroke within our biracial metropolitan population of 1,349,351, of whom 215,611 (15%) are of black race (US Census 2000). We have studied trends in stroke incidence and case fatality, as well as the prevalence of risk factors and knowledge of stroke (via a population survey) for almost 15 years and have demonstrated a racial disparity where stroke incidence in African-Americans is more than double that of whites. In addition to continuing these important activities, we propose an innovative pilot study that will be the largest prospective, population-based stroke outcomes study to date. The anticipated ~3,200 patients with strokes and 800 TIAs from our region in 2010, as well as the 2,000 surveyed participants, will be used to test the following hypotheses: 1. Temporal trends in the incidence rate of stroke will demonstrate a decrease over time in whites (as shown by our 2005 preliminary data). However, there will not be a similar decrease among blacks, a racial group that has not been examined in other temporal studies of stroke. We expect that case fatality rates will not change between periods, and will be similar for both blacks and whites. 2. A cohort of subjects followed by a regional HIE combined with phone-call follow-up will be more representative of the entire stroke population in our region than a cohort of subjects that agree to in-person interviews, which is likely to have participation and survival biases. Information obtained via this approach will be as valid as data from manual chart abstraction and direct interview for determining access to care and individual patients' functional outcome after stroke across a region, and will be more efficient to collect than that obtained via manual processes. 3. The proportion of the population that knows warning signs or risk factors for stroke will NOT improve between 2006 and 2011, based on our preliminary data. When subjects are asked about their own personal risk for stroke, a lower self-perceived risk will be associated with worse stroke knowledge. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The change in stroke occurrence over time is the ultimate test of how well science has translated new discoveries into benefits for the population. Our study has examined racial disparities in stroke over the last 15 years, showing that blacks have higher risk for stroke than whites. In our population, the occurrence of stroke is decreasing in whites but not African Americans, and we will continue to describe trends in stroke occurrence, cause, treatment, and outcome in a biracial metropolitan population.

"Home-Based Automated Therapy of Arm Function After Stroke Via Tele-Rehabilitation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Constraint-Induced Movement therapy (CIMT) is one of few techniques that has been shown in controlled studies to produce large improvements in real-world arm function in stroke survivors with mild to moderate hemiparesis. The standard treatment involves one-on-one training of paretic arm use in the clinic for 3 hr/day for 10 consecutive weekdays and placing a mitt on the other hand to discourage its use. The considerable cost of CIMT, due to the demand on therapist time and requirement that patients travel daily to a clinic for 2 weeks, imposes substantial limits on those who might access the therapy. Our lab, with Peter Lum, Ph.D., has developed a device for automating the delivery of CIMT named AutoCITE; it permits practice of 8 upper- extremity tasks and provides frequent graphical performance feedback. Two reports indicate that AutoCITE is as efficacious as standard CIMT even with therapist effort reduced by 75%. A third report suggests that AutoCITE under simulated telerehabilitation conditions (i.e., patient and therapist were in different rooms in the lab) is also just as efficacious. We propose to modify AutoCITE so that it is more appropriate for use in patients' homes and evaluate its efficacy for providing CIMT on a telerehab basis. We will also specifically test whether making the AutoCITE software more interactive helps patients to comply with training at home, where there are more distractions. To this end, we will randomize 87 chronic stroke survivors to: 1. AutoCITE training in the home with two patients supervised concurrently by one therapist remotely via an Internet-based audio- visual link, 2. the same procedures except that the more interactive software will be run on AutoCITE, and 3. dose-matched, standard CIMT in the home. Motor outcomes and costs from the home-based, two-on-one, tele-AutoCITE groups will be compared to those from the home-based, one-on-one, in vivo CIMT group and to those from laboratory-based AutoCITE and standard CIMT groups run previously. If successful, AutoCITE, which involves simply automating task practice with actual objects and is much less expensive than prevailing virtual reality based approaches, might serve as a platform for delivering other upper-extremity therapies, in addition to CIMT, via telerehab. With about 300,000 new stroke survivors suffering motor disability annually, cutting the cost of and increasing access to efficacious upper-extremity rehabilitation has the potential to reduce disability significantly.

There are approximately 300,000 new strokes survivors with residual motor disability annually.

"Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Geographic and racial disparities in stroke mortality have existed for over 50 years with an incremental annual cost of $4.6 billion. Many causes for these disparities have been proposed, but existing research has inadequately addressed these, and interventions have failed to reduce their magnitude. Further, national data are not available describing the prevalence of cognitive decline, a problem largely caused by cerebrovascular disease and its risk factors. With completion of recruitment, baseline evaluation and follow-up of a national cohort of 30,000 black and white community dwelling participants, the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study is uniquely positioned to test older but unsubstantiated hypotheses explaining race/region disparities, to assess new evidence-based hypotheses, and to provide the first national data on predictors of cognitive decline. In this continuation application we propose to continue follow-up for incident stroke and cognitive decline among this cohort, which will quadruple the number of observed stroke events arid provide longitudinal data on cognitive decline. These data will provide the opportunity to investigate the underlying causes of the disparities in stroke mortality by assessing the role of confounding factors to mediate the observed excess risk among African Americans and Southerners, and to develop risk functions for relatively rare stroke subtypes including ICH and SAH. Preliminary analysis from REGARDS suggests that there is a-""cognitive decline belt"" that is concordant with the Stroke belt. The data from the continuation will allow a refinement of the description of these disparities, and, using similar analysis approaches employed for the stroke outcomes, will provide insights into the causes for these disparities. Finally, we will investigate the role of cognitive decline as a predictor for subsequent stroke events. Completion of these aims will allow for development of interventions to eliminate disparities in the incidence of stroke and cognitive decline. Implementation of specific interventions customized for black and white populations, and by region of the United States, may reduce health disparities in stroke recognition and treatment, risk factor prevention, and optimal management of existing risk factors.

Some of the differential impact of stroke on women and African Americans might be explained by differential acute treatment and post-acute rehabilitative services, and by differential support of informal family caregivers. These factors have rarely been studied in representative population- based samples of stroke survivors. This application seeks funding to study these factors in a national sample of stroke survivors who are also Medicare beneficiaries. The Caring for Adults Recovering from the Effects of Stroke (CARES) study is an ancillary study of the national REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) project and is the only study of its kind that is systematically collecting long-term functional outcome data from the survivors of verified incident stroke events that are detected in a large-scale, prospective, epidemiologic investigation. Primary family caregivers are also enrolled in the CARES project, and to date, 210 stroke survivor/ family caregiver dyads have been enrolled. Most of these stroke survivors (N = 183, 87%) are traditional Medicare beneficiaires for whom Medicare claims data for the acute hospitalization and post-acute rehabilitative or recovery phase are available. Stroke survivor functional outcomes are assessed during structured in-home evaluations approximately one year after the incident stroke events, and stroke survivor and family caregiver psychosocial functioning and quality of life are assessed with structured telephone interviews beginning 9 months after the incident stroke event and continuing up to 3 years after the stroke event. As part of this proposed extension to the CARES project, we will expand our inclusion criteria to include more stroke survivors, including those without family caregivers, and our total sample size will increase to 420 stroke survivors, including 365 who are also traditional Medicare beneficiaries. While continuing to study outcome disparities among all stroke survivors, new specific aims are advanced in this proposal that focus on measures of health care utilization from the Medicare claims data. Most of the previous studies on care utilization after stroke and the long-term outcomes of stroke have not assessed the influences or experiences of informal family caregivers, and we hypothesize that differences in caregiver availability and involvement will partially explain previously observed gender and race differences in care utilization and functional outcomes. The CARES project is uniquely positioned to link demographic variables, stroke severity measures, post-stroke care utilization patterns, informal caregiving factors, and long-term functional outcomes in ways that will add new knowledge to the literature on why women and African Americans have poorer outcomes after stroke. The project will also advance our general understanding of how stroke affects both patients and their families more broadly.        Stroke is a common medical problem for older adults. Most of the formal rehabilitative care after stroke is covered by traditional Medicare claims, and most stroke patients also receive considerable informal care from close family members. The proposed research will examine the links between informal caregiving support, formal care utilization, and long-term stroke outcomes using a national epidemiologic sample. Caregiving supports during the acute hospitalization and post-acute rehabilitative phases are expected to differ by race and gender, and to partially account for previously observed race and gender differences in outcomes.

"Stroke Incidence and Risk Factors in a Tri-Ethnic Region    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke and cognitive impairment remain a major public health problem with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. The reasons for these race-ethnic disparities are not entirely clear. Improved detection and control of novel stroke risk factors are needed to reduce vascular disease burden. The Northern Manhattan prospective cohort consists of a population-based cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults enrolled since 2001 who have been followed annually for stroke, MI, and death. This collaborative study now involves faculty across 2 academic institutions and is the first prospective cohort study among whites, blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community. Over the last 5 years, the aims have expanded to include subclinical carotid, cardiac, and brain measures. High-resolution carotid imaging data has been assembled on 1770 subjects and a neuropsychological battery and standardized brain MRI will be completed on 1300 subjects with quantitative analyses to measure white matter hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds. This grant supports continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke, MI, and vascular death) and adiponectin, a new marker of obesity, new measures of subclinical carotid disease (carotid plaque area and densitometry), and quantitative MRI measures of vascular subclinical brain disease, as well as evaluate the impact on cognitive decline. To accomplish these aims, stored baseline plasma will be used to measure fasting adiponectin levels. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be quantitatively analyzed from standardized digital recordings. Repeat neuro-psychological testing emphasizing frontal-executive domains will be done on 1105 subjects. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive for any vascular event. Community stroke surveillance will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. The strengths of this cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of traditional and emerging risk factors, and the innovative assessment of MRI subclinical disease and carotid subclinical disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and coronary heart disease comprise two of the top three leading causes of death in the US and are of increasing importance in developing countries. While heart disease is the leading cause of death, stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. Stroke continues to have a disproportionate impact on mortality for blacks compared to whites. The aging and rapid growth of the black and Hispanic population has the potential to lead to future increases in the public health impact of stroke and vascular disease. The economic burden in the US due to stroke among Hispanics and blacks from 2005 to 2050 is projected to be $313 billion for Hispanics, and $379 billion for blacks.       Race-ethnic disparities are driven by differences in stroke incidence and vascular risk factors and have remained significant even after accounting for differences in socioeconomic status. Healthy People 2010 called for an elimination of race-ethnic disparities, but did not provide a clear method to achieve this lofty goal.       The principal goals of our study are to help fill the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of stroke and vascular disease particularly among blacks and Hispanics in order to improve future prevention efforts. We have broadened our focus to investigate markers of obesity, subclinical disease measures of the carotid arteries and brain, and predictors of vascular cognitive impairment and decline. We need to understand the importance of these conditions in predicting stroke, MI, vascular death, and determining cognitive decline among minority populations.

"Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/Intervention Research Program in Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/ Intervention Research Program in Health Disparities is a partnership of UCLA, four medical centers in the Los Angeles County safety net system, Healthy African American Families, and representatives from multiple community organizations serving low-income minority communities that span the Los Angeles basin. In this most diverse county in the US in race/ethnicity, we propose a multi-disciplinary, highly collaborative Program to create and test sustainable interventions to reduce or eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in the occurrence of stroke, and to generate new knowledge about mechanisms for such disparities. Project I creates a strong community-based component with community health workers and mobile health technology to create a full-fledged Chronic Care Model intervention that will be tested relative to usual care in 500 patients with a recent stroke seen in the Los Angeles County safety net. A cost analysis and a formative evaluation will guide development of a financial sustainability plan. Project II will elucidate the role of novel biological and social risk factors for stroke risk and trends over time, in a nationa data set. Project III builds on an existing close partnership with the City of Los Angeles Department of Aging to develop and test a culturally-tailored behavioral stroke risk factor reduction/walking intervention - delivered by senior center staff-with 240 high risk seniors from Korean, Chinese, African-American and Hispanic racial/ethnic groups. Four cores include an Administrative Core A that supports all three projects; a Research Education and Training Core B that will recruit, retain, and develop stroke disparities-relevant curriculum for academic researchers, community research support personnel and other community stake holders; a Biomarker Collection and Analysis Core C to support Project I and III biomarker data collection, consulting for all three projects, and development of educational programming on biomarkers; and a Community Engagement, Outreach, and Dissemination Core D that supports and interacts with all three projects by promoting and sustaining community-academic partnerships through bidirectional knowledge sharing and by creating strategies for disseminating advances in knowledge about stroke prevention disparities research through outreach to affected communities locally and nationally.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A coordinated effort of researchers and community partners is needed to reduce or eliminate the higher rates of stroke among low-income Latinos, African-Americans, and Asian Americans in underserved communities.

"Ethnic/Racial Variation in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) occurs when a blood vessel ruptures within the brain parenchyma leading to neurologic injury and frequently death. Approximately 40-50% of patients who suffer from an ICH will die from the hemorrhage. Of the survivors, the majority are disabled. Thus, ICH is the subtype of stroke with the highest morbidity and mortality rates. Minority populations of African-Americans and Hispanics have been found to have roughly double the rate of ICH as whites and on average, have ICH at a younger age. Yet despite this disproportionate health care burden, fewer than 200 ICH cases among African-Americans and less than a hundred ICH cases among Hispanics have been collected with DNA available for testing. Our proposal is to collect 1000 cases of ICH among whites, 1000 cases of ICH among blacks, 1000 cases of ICH among Hispanics, and 3000 controls matched to the cases by race/ethnicity, age (5 years), gender and geographic location. Our long-term goal is to perform a genome-wide association study of intracerebral hemorrhage which includes a significant proportion of minorities with ICH. A genome-wide association study evaluates DNA with hundreds of thousands of markers to identify regions or genes which are associated with either a greater or lesser risk of ICH. However, the current proposal will not complete this type of analysis as insufficient numbers are currently available. Thus, the goals of the current proposal are to: 1) understand the risk factors of greatest importance for ICH among blacks and Hispanics; 2) determine differences in brain-imaging by race/ethnicity; 3) determine factors that mediate differences in outcomes rates by race/ethnicity; and 4) determine if Hispanics and African-Americans from different regions or national origin (such as Mexican, Cuban, etc.) are genetically different. To accomplish these goals, we have 11 recruitment centers representing 30 recruitment hospitals throughout the United States with large populations of African-Americans and Hispanics. White ICH cases from the same regions will also be recruited to account for regional differences in risk factors as well as a comparison group for risk factors, outcomes and imaging differences. A centralized neuroimaging center will be developed for uniform reading and analysis of films at Massachusetts General Hospital in conjunction with Georgetown University. A biorepository will be developed for centralized DNA processing and sample handling at the Miami Institute for Human Genomics. And a data and statistical center will be developed at Wake Forest University. The major advantages of this study are the experience of the investigators, particularly with recruitment of minority populations and particular interest in ICH and epidemiology; uniform definitions of cases, risk factors, and centralized analyses; and the ability to identify and recruit the large number of subjects (6000 total) required for the study.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability among adults. More people are disabled by stroke than Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, cancer or AIDS. Intracerebral hemorrhage is the type of stroke with the highest death and disability rates. ICH occurs in 70,000 Americans every year and a single year of ICH cases in the United States leads to approximately $3.7 billion dollars of health care costs. African-Americans and Hispanics have twice the rate of this type of stroke than whites do and have this type of stroke at an earlier age in life. Yet we know little about the biologic differences that lead to this ethnic disparity. Our proposal will compare minorities with ICH to controls from the same population as well as explore genetic,   radiographic and outcomes differences.

"Infection and Stroke in Mexican Americans Stroke is the third leading cause of death and leading cause of disability in adults in the US. Nearly 800,000 people suffer a stroke annually, and more than 143,000 deaths occur as a result. Hispanic Americans are the fastest growing minority population in the US, as well as the most numerous. The majority of Hispanic Americans are of Mexican descent. Mexican Americans (MAs) have an increased risk of stroke especially at younger ages when disability has the greatest impact. Reasons for increased stroke risk in MAs are not fully understood but traditional risk factors are not likely to fully account for the increased stroke burden in this population. Chronic infectious pathogens have been proposed as risk factors for stroke and for poor stroke outcome, although the evidence remains inconclusive and studies have not been done in MAs. As chronic infections are more prevalent in MAs than their non-Hispanic white counterparts, this risk factor may be particularly important for this population. The proposed dissertation research seeks to examine the links between chronic infection and incident stroke and post-stroke functional outcome, among participants from the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA). This research will extend current knowledge of infection and stroke in several critical ways:1) by examining antibody response to several infectious agents versus infection serostatus as independent risk factors for stroke, 2) by examining the underlying mechanisms, including inflammatory pathways, by which antibody response may influence stroke risk, 3) by investigating the association of antibody response to post-stroke functional outcomes and 4) by focusing specifically in a MA population known to experience a greater stroke burden as well as a greater infection burden. The recognition that infection increases stroke risk after accounting for traditional risk factors may have important implications for the prevention of stroke in MAs and for reducing the stroke health disparity in this population. In addition to advancing the science in this critical area, the proposed fellowship will provide the rigorous training, including coursework and seminars/workshops, interaction with stroke neurologists and epidemiologists and hands-on training in population-based studies and laboratory methods, needed to develop the applicant from a doctoral student to an independent investigator who will devote her research career to the study of stroke and its determinants, including infection. Project Narrative  Chronic infectious pathogens have been proposed as risk factors for stroke, but current evidence is inconclusive. As chronic infections are highly prevalent in Mexican Americans, this risk factor may be particularly important for this population which is vulnerable to stroke.

"Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the highly successful Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project. BASIC is the only ongoing stroke surveillance project focusing on Mexican Americans. Mexican Americans are the largest segment of the Hispanic American population, the United States' largest minority group. Since the inception of this project in January 2000, we have assembled a cohort of over 4,992 cerebrovascular disease patients for whom we are able to follow for recurrent cerebrovascular events as well as mortality. This gives us tremendous power to detect associations with biological and social risk factors for stroke, important to Mexican Americans as well as the broader United States population. We have demonstrated increased stroke incidence and recurrence in Mexican Americans. Stroke severity and ischemic stroke subtypes are similar between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Mortality following stroke appears to be less in Mexican Americans. In the next five years we are positioned to delineate trends in stroke rates, and to explore the potential reasons for the increased stroke burden in Mexican Americans, as well as their improved survival. This information will be critically important to all populations to reduce the devastation of stroke. We will continue to make important observations useful for planning delivery of stroke care in communities. For the first time we will investigate functional and cognitive outcome following stroke in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We will now also study the role of health care quality and medication compliance on stroke outcomes. We will collect blood on all stroke patients useful for genetic studies by our group and others, and we have initiated stroke surveillance in a similar community within Mexico that will serve as a great basis for comparison to the Corpus Christi population. BASIC has been a very prolific study with more than 27 original peer-reviewed publications in the last four years alone. Indeed, this study is just beginning to provide the rich epidemiologic and clinical data that are necessary to control the epidemic of cerebrovascular disease in Mexican Americans. We know that the next five years will allow us to make contributions that will be directly useful for interventions to reduce health disparities, prevent stroke and improve stroke outcomes in all populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a competitive renewal for the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project. This highly successful community-based stroke epidemiology project seeks to understand the health disparity for stroke among Mexican Americans and non Hispanic whites in Corpus Christi, Texas. This accomplished through observational epidemiology and interviews of patients. No intervention is contained in the study.

"Effects of early exercise on muscle and cardiovascular health after stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke leads to profound physical deconditioning and abnormalities in paretic leg muscle including shift to fast twitch muscle phenotype, inflammation and gross atrophy that worsen cardiometabolic health by promoting insulin resistance. Yet, no prior studies have considered stroke as a catabolic syndrome in aging that can be modified by early exercise to improve muscle and cardiometabolic health. In chronic stroke, we have exercise models that improve mobility, restore fitness levels nearly 40%, and reverse impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and T2DM status in 58% of cases, even years after stroke. Lab findings suggest our exercise programs increase total myofibrillar protein and proportion of slow twitch in paretic leg muscle, implicating both altered protein synthesis and regulation of muscle molecular phenotype as mechanisms underlying the benefits of exercise post-stroke. This study investigates the hypothesis that in African-Jamaican adults with recent stroke, structured exercise across the sub-acute recovery period and into the chronic phase of stroke care will improve P leg muscle and cardiometabolic health, compared to controls receiving best medical care. Aims and associated hypotheses are to compare effects of 6 months structured and progressive exercise vs. best medical care implemented early after stroke in African-Jamaican adults on: Aim #1. Paretic & non-paretic leg mixed muscle protein synthesis and breakdown in the fed and fasted state, TNF-1 expression, thigh muscle volume and strength. Hypothesis 1: Paretic leg muscle has reduced protein synthesis and increased breakdown compared to non- paretic leg; Exercise will increase mixed muscle protein synthesis and reduce breakdown to increase muscle volume and strength by mechanism(s) of reducing inflammation in paretic leg, compared to controls. Aim #2. Glucose tolerance, fitness, and muscle phenotype. Hypothesis 2: Exercise will improve fitness levels, insulin and glucose response to oral glucose challenge, and increase paretic leg slow twitch muscle phenotype.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic hemiparetic stroke is associated changes in body composition, skeletal muscle and cardiometabolic health; specific changes include paretic limb muscular atrophy, increased intramuscular fat deposition, elevated prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. This randomized intervention study compares a 6 month task oriented exercise programs versus control with both groups receiving best medical stroke care according to American Stroke Association ""Get with the Guidelines"". The hypothesis is that is 6 months of task-oriented exercise initiated early across the sub-acute period of stroke can prevent or ameliorate the natural course of these body composition, skeletal muscle and cardiometabolic health changes.

"The Discovering Healthcare Innovations to Address Disparties in Stroke (DIADS) pr     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans experience the highest rates of stroke of all race/ethnic groups In the US. Stroke in African American occurs at younger ages than Caucasians. While racial disparities in stroke exist at all ages, disparities are greatest in young adulthood. Temporal trend data suggest that these stroke disparities in young adulthood may be widening. Hypertension is the most common and potent risk factor for stroke in the US. Blood pressure (BP) control rates are known to differ by race and may be an important contributor to racial disparities in stroke. Disparities in blood pressure control are most prominent in younger adulthood, further contributing to disparities in stroke rates in this age group. Efforts aimed at the primary prevention of stroke have generally not focused on young adulthood, despite the greatest disparities in incident disease being observed in this period and the opportunity for long-term risk reduction via interventions targeted early in adulthood. Effective intervention targeting known stroke risk factors (e.g. hypertension) have not been developed for young adults. Additionally the literature on novel risk factors present in young adulthood that may be amenable to additional risk reduction is currently lacking. DIADS is collaboration between Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). DIADS seeks to design, implement, and evaluate a clinically-delivered hypertension control intervention that consists of both a clinical algorithm for rapid an effective blood BP control, as well as a culturally-tailored dietary Intervention aimed at more effective sustained BP control. Specific Aim 1: To conduct a cluster pragmatic randomized trial of a clinically-delivered hypertension control intervention (Shake, Rattle, and Roll) that will consist of a clinical algorithm for rapid and sustained blood pressure control, as well as a culturally tailored dietary intervention. Specific Aim 2: To conduct an observational cohort study of children, adolescents, and young adults within KPNC to identify temporal trends in traditional risk factors for stroke in the young, as well as novel factors that may Increase stroke risk in thi age group. Specific Aim 3: To implement the essential components of the Shake, Rattle, and Roll hypertension control intervention in a local community clinic serving a diverse population and then disseminate the intervention among a broad coalition of community clinics in Alameda County and San Francisco County.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood pressure control rates are known to differ by race and are likely be an important contributor to racial disparities in stroke, particularly for young Afrian American adults in whom a disturbing increase in stroke rates has occurred in recent years. The DIADS program will provide information that is likely to result in better understanding of stroke etiology in the young and a hypertension (HTN) treatment program that can reduce HTN control disparities and be disseminated widely, resulting in reduction of stroke disparities.              Blood pressure control rates are known to differ by race and are likely be an important contributor to racial disparities in stroke, particularly for young Afrian American adults in whom a disturbing increase in stroke rates has occurred in recent years.

"Stroke Incidence and Risk Factors in a Tri-Ethnic Region    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke and cognitive impairment remain a major public health problem with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. The reasons for these race-ethnic disparities are not entirely clear. Improved detection and control of novel stroke risk factors are needed to reduce vascular disease burden. The Northern Manhattan prospective cohort consists of a population-based cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults enrolled since 2001 who have been followed annually for stroke, MI, and death. This collaborative study now involves faculty across 2 academic institutions and is the first prospective cohort study among whites, blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community. Over the last 5 years, the aims have expanded to include subclinical carotid, cardiac, and brain measures. High-resolution carotid imaging data has been assembled on 1770 subjects and a neuropsychological battery and standardized brain MRI will be completed on 1300 subjects with quantitative analyses to measure white matter hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds. This grant supports continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke, MI, and vascular death) and adiponectin, a new marker of obesity, new measures of subclinical carotid disease (carotid plaque area and densitometry), and quantitative MRI measures of vascular subclinical brain disease, as well as evaluate the impact on cognitive decline. To accomplish these aims, stored baseline plasma will be used to measure fasting adiponectin levels. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be quantitatively analyzed from standardized digital recordings. Repeat neuro-psychological testing emphasizing frontal-executive domains will be done on 1105 subjects. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive for any vascular event. Community stroke surveillance will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. The strengths of this cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of traditional and emerging risk factors, and the innovative assessment of MRI subclinical disease and carotid subclinical disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and coronary heart disease comprise two of the top three leading causes of death in the US and are of increasing importance in developing countries. While heart disease is the leading cause of death, stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. Stroke continues to have a disproportionate impact on mortality for blacks compared to whites. The aging and rapid growth of the black and Hispanic population has the potential to lead to future increases in the public health impact of stroke and vascular disease. The economic burden in the US due to stroke among Hispanics and blacks from 2005 to 2050 is projected to be $313 billion for Hispanics, and $379 billion for blacks.       Race-ethnic disparities are driven by differences in stroke incidence and vascular risk factors and have remained significant even after accounting for differences in socioeconomic status. Healthy People 2010 called for an elimination of race-ethnic disparities, but did not provide a clear method to achieve this lofty goal.       The principal goals of our study are to help fill the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of stroke and vascular disease particularly among blacks and Hispanics in order to improve future prevention efforts. We have broadened our focus to investigate markers of obesity, subclinical disease measures of the carotid arteries and brain, and predictors of vascular cognitive impairment and decline. We need to understand the importance of these conditions in predicting stroke, MI, vascular death, and determining cognitive decline among minority populations.

"Effect of Statins and Modifiable Factors on Stroke Outcome in Atrial Fibrillation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the third leading cause of mortality and a leading cause of disability in the U.S. Cardioembolic strokes resulting from atrial fibrillation (AF) are particularly devastating, with a 30-day mortality of 25%. The number of individuals with AF is projected to reach 8 million by 2020, and will disproportionately burden the elderly. The challenge and paradox of AF is that many of the risk factors for stroke are also risk factors for hemorrhage, limiting the use of anticoagulant therapy among those at greatest risk. Patients enrolled in clinical trials often bear little resemblance to the higher risk patients in clinical practice making it difficult to extrapolate estimates of treatment efficacy and safety. Trial participants are younger, more often male, less medically complex, less symptomatic, and specifically selected for lower bleeding risk. Despite their greater burden of risk factors, minorities have constituted less than 5% of AF trial populations. Aspirin is a marginally effective therapy in AF and causes bleeding almost as frequently as anticoagulants, particularly in the elderly. For instance, the rate of intracranial hemorrhage has quintupled in recent years, due to expanded use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy in older adults; 46% are fatal. Preventive strategies without attendant bleeding risk are urgently needed to mitigate the impact of stroke in AF. Although proinflammatory stimuli like hyperglycemia, infection, accelerated hypertension, heart failure, and dyslipidemia are potent triggers for thrombin generation, their effect on AF stroke outcomes has not been studied. The anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties of HMG CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) provide a biological rationale to hypothesize reduced severity (size) of AF stroke. Experimental studies report reduced platelet deposition; platelet mediated thrombin generation, and reduced infarct volume. The relations among statins, modifiable and nonmodifiable stroke risk factors, antithrombotic therapy and AF stroke outcomes have yet to be elucidated. To address these knowledge gaps, we will assemble a large cohort of consecutive AF stroke admissions (ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage) from 2006-2010 (n=2,500, 35% underrepresented minority, 43% >75 years of age) from 3 strategic sites to address the following aims:  1. To determine AF stroke disability and 30-day case fatality by age, sex, race/ethnicity;  2. To examine the relation of acute prothrombotic inflammatory triggers on stroke severity in AF;  3. To study the associations of antithrombotic treatment, including statins, and risk factors to stroke  severity in AF. Our application will address these aims through the unique and complementary strengths of  the collaborating investigators and institutions: Boston Medical Center, University of Alabama, and Geisinger  Health System of Pennsylvania. Our application will inform critical knowledge gaps in AF stroke, target  strategies to mitigate stroke severity, and assess the relations of antithrombotic and statin therapy to stroke  outcomes across the spectrum of stroke risk among diverse AF patient populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reduction of stroke disability and racial/ethnic disparities in stroke deaths is a pressing U.S. health concern. Through this proposal, we aim to identify stroke prevention approaches for key underrepresented demographic subgroups. Our proposal will inform critical knowledge gaps in AF stroke, target strategies to mitigate stroke severity, and assess the effects of antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and statin therapy among diverse AF patient populations across the spectrum of stroke risk.

"Sleep apnea health disparities in Mexican American stroke patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the US and a leading cause of death. Mexican Americans (MA), the largest subgroup of Hispanic Americans, have a substantially higher stroke risk than European Americans, especially at younger ages where the risk is more than double. Given the greater risk and earlier onset, the impact of stroke is disproportionately experienced by MAs. Reasons for increased stroke risk in MAs are poorly understood. More than half of ischemic stroke patients have sleep apnea, a very common and important risk factor for stroke and potentially a risk factor for poor stroke outcome. No published studies have established the prevalence of sleep apnea in MAs to discern sleep apnea's contribution to excess stroke burden in this population. Small studies conducted in academic medical centers have suggested that stroke patients with sleep apnea have particularly poor stroke outcomes, but population-based studies in diverse populations are lacking. The current application seeks to investigate health disparities related to sleep apnea in stroke patients in order to understand the marked ethnic differences in stroke. This research will inform the development of interventions to prevent or treat sleep apnea in MAs, which will reduce the ethnic stroke disparity. The parent study for this project, the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project, is an ongoing population-based stroke surveillance study that identifies stroke cases in Nueces County, Texas. This study has made many important discoveries about stroke in Hispanics. BASIC will continue to identify all strokes in Nueces County until mid year 3 of the current application and will provide detailed 90-day stroke outcome data until mid year 2. The current application will extend BASIC data collection through year 5 month 3 and will add: (1) sleep apnea screening in the acute stroke period that differentiates obstructive from central events, (2) sleep apnea screening for intracerebral hemorrhage cases, (3) access to care measures for sleep apnea, and (4) genetic admixture analysis to investigate how genetics may relate to ethnic disparities in sleep apnea. The application seeks, in a cost-containing fashion, to understand and remedy the influence of a very frequent risk factor, sleep apnea, on a common, devastating disease, stroke, in the largest and fastest growing US minority population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep apnea is an important predictor of stroke and appears to be a predictor of poor outcomes after stroke. Using the preexisting infrastructure of the BASIC project, the current application will provide an assessment of health disparities related to sleep apnea in stroke patients. It will also allow for the rigorous study of ethnic comparisons of sleep apnea after stroke in European Americans and Hispanics, the largest minority in the United States.

"A Community Partnership to Treat Stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans suffer a disproportionate number of strokes resulting in greater post-stroke disability and mortality compared to European Americans. Despite the fact that tissue plasminogen activase (tPA), decreases post-stroke morbidity, mortality and is cost saving, it is underutilized especially among African Americans who are up to one-fifth as likely to receive tPA as European Americans. The primary reason for the underutilization of acute stroke treatments is delayed patient presentation to the hospital which would be remedied by increasing prompt 911 calls for stroke. If all patients presented to the hospital immediately over 25% of stroke patients would receive tPA compared with the 1-3% that are currently treated. The long-term goal of this career development award is to promote the candidate's development into a clinical and research leader in behavioral interventions focusing on health disparities of neurologic disease. The aims of this project are 1)To develop and validate theory-based stroke education intervention materials and outcome measures that use simulated stroke patient video vignettes; 2)To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a faith-based, scientific theory-driven, peer-led behavioral intervention to increase stroke awareness and behavioral intent to call 911 among African American youth and adults in Flint, Michigan. This project is based on a partnership with Bridges into the Future, an African American faith-based community group in Flint, Michigan who will help to design and pre test novel intervention materials and outcome assessments. Then a single group repeated measures design feasibility study will be conducted to obtain preliminary evidence for the impact of our adapted intervention and to test the novel stroke outcome measure. The candidate is committed to a career as a rigorously trained clinician scientist and requires additional training in order to accomplish her long-term goal of reducing health disparities in neurologic disease via behavioral interventions. A detailed career development plan will promote the candidate's development of expertise in the science of behavioral interventions, advanced statistical analysis and an interdisciplinary understanding of health disparities. The career development plan consists of a multidisciplinary team of experts in each of these areas who will oversee a range of formal coursework, working meetings and practical experiences in these areas to ensure the candidate's future success. Excellent resources of a top university and a mentoring team with demonstrated success in developing junior investigators in these topic areas makes the University of Michigan an ideal environment for this project.        Getting to the hospital quickly is the key to treating stroke. African Americans suffer more strokes with worse outcomes and receive stroke treatments less often than European Americans. This project will work to reduce these health disparities by creating and testing the feasibility of a peer-led faith-based behavioral intervention in an African American community with a goal to increase calls to 911 so stroke patients can be treated quickly.

"Stroke Health and Risk Education (SHARE)  Abstract: Stroke is a disease with tremendous individual, family, and societal impact. It is the number one cause of adult disability and third leading cause of death in the United States. Between now and the year 2050, the cost of stroke in the United States will exceed 2 trillion dollars. There is a tremendous ethnic disparity with respect to stroke in the United States. Mexican Americans are much more likely to have a stroke compared with European Americans. In Mexican Americans strokes occur at younger ages, are more likely to recur and have the same severity as they do in European Americans. Mexican Americans are the overwhelming largest sub- population of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority group. This proposal, a scientifically-based rigorous behavioral education intervention trial, seeks to aggressively prevent stroke, especially in Mexican Americans. Faith and family are strong components of Mexican American culture. This project works with these positive fundamental elements in order to affect stroke prevention. This project will take place in Nueces County, Texas. The project investigators have worked in this community for the past 14 years and have published extensively regarding the stroke health disparity in this stable, non-immigrant community of Mexican Americans and European Americans. We have established a strong partnership with the Catholic Diocese of Corpus Christi and assembled a team with tremendous experience at successful health behavior intervention research. Together, a proposal has been crafted that will directly speak to aggressive stroke risk factor reduction in Mexican Americans and European Americans in this representative United States community. The significance of such research is tremendous. As the Mexican American population grows and ages, the stroke impact will be felt with greater and greater intensity. Now is the time to develop aggressive, scientifically tested interventions to limit the burden of this disease on this important segment of the United States population, and to reduce the costs of this disease to the country as a whole, in keeping with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) goal to ""identify culturally appropriate, effective stroke prevention programs for nationwide implementation in minority communities"" by FY2010.  Project Narrative Mexican Americans, the largest sub-population of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority group, have a higher risk of stroke than non-Hispanic whites. This proposal seeks to reduce stroke risk, especially in Mexican Americans, through a scientifically-based rigorous behavioral intervention trial.

"Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to continue our population-based study of stroke incidence, risk factors, treatment, and outcome of stroke within our biracial metropolitan population of 1,349,351, of whom 215,611 (15%) are of black race (US Census 2000). We have studied trends in stroke incidence and case fatality, as well as the prevalence of risk factors and knowledge of stroke (via a population survey) for almost 15 years and have demonstrated a racial disparity where stroke incidence in African-Americans is more than double that of whites. In addition to continuing these important activities, we propose an innovative pilot study that will be the largest prospective, population-based stroke outcomes study to date. The anticipated ~3,200 patients with strokes and 800 TIAs from our region in 2010, as well as the 2,000 surveyed participants, will be used to test the following hypotheses: 1. Temporal trends in the incidence rate of stroke will demonstrate a decrease over time in whites (as shown by our 2005 preliminary data). However, there will not be a similar decrease among blacks, a racial group that has not been examined in other temporal studies of stroke. We expect that case fatality rates will not change between periods, and will be similar for both blacks and whites. 2. A cohort of subjects followed by a regional HIE combined with phone-call follow-up will be more representative of the entire stroke population in our region than a cohort of subjects that agree to in-person interviews, which is likely to have participation and survival biases. Information obtained via this approach will be as valid as data from manual chart abstraction and direct interview for determining access to care and individual patients' functional outcome after stroke across a region, and will be more efficient to collect than that obtained via manual processes. 3. The proportion of the population that knows warning signs or risk factors for stroke will NOT improve between 2006 and 2011, based on our preliminary data. When subjects are asked about their own personal risk for stroke, a lower self-perceived risk will be associated with worse stroke knowledge. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The change in stroke occurrence over time is the ultimate test of how well science has translated new discoveries into benefits for the population. Our study has examined racial disparities in stroke over the last 15 years, showing that blacks have higher risk for stroke than whites. In our population, the occurrence of stroke is decreasing in whites but not African Americans, and we will continue to describe trends in stroke occurrence, cause, treatment, and outcome in a biracial metropolitan population.

In our population, the occurrence of stroke is decreasing in whites but NOT African-Amerians, and we will continue to describe trends in stroke occurrence, cause, treatment, and outcome in a biracial metropolitan population.",Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites,8304957,R01NS030678,"['postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Awareness ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Black race ', ' Censuses ', ' Brain TIA ', ' Transient Ischemic Attack ', ' Communities ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Group Practice ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Kentucky ', ' Laboratories ', ' Locales ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurology ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Screening procedure ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Respondent ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' response ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Health Informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Progress Review Group ', ' Qualifying ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' operation ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R01,2012,1231029,0.47685546697824754
"Impact of disordered mineral metabolism on stroke and cognitive impairment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke and cognitive impairment are major causes of death and disability in the US and disproportionately impact blacks. While traditional stroke risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes contribute to racial disparities in cerebrovascular outcomes, they are not sufficient to completely explain these findings, suggesting that non-traditional risk factors play an important role. Disturbances in vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism have emerged as non-traditional risk factors for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels are associated with heart disease and death via broad effects on inflammation, insulin resistance and blood pressure control. Disturbances in phosphorus metabolism stimulate the secretion of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a bone-derived hormone that maintains phosphorus homeostasis in part by inhibiting the conversion of 25D to its activated metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). Our group and others showed that higher FGF23 levels were associated with adverse outcomes through direct and indirect effects promoting cardiovascular disease and 1,25D deficiency. Moreover, preliminary data from our group suggest that low vitamin D is an independent risk factor for stroke and cognitive impairment. The primary focus of the current proposal is to build upon this prior work by determining whether low plasma 25D levels and excess plasma FGF23 levels are associated with incident stroke and cognitive impairment in a large, national cohort (Aim 1). In addition, since disorders of vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism are more common and severe in blacks than whites, we will determine if they partly underlie racial disparities in stroke (Aim 2). Finally, given that inflammation, insulin resistance and hypertension are key risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, and are interconnected with disturbances in vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism, we will determine whether they partly mediate the associations of 25D and FGF23 with stroke and cognitive decline. We will test these hypotheses by measuring plasma 25D, FGF23 and other key mediators of mineral metabolism including 1,25D, parathyroid hormone, calcium and phosphate in stored blood samples from a specified case cohort of 2,085 participants of the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, a national prospective study of black and white adults designed to identify novel risk factors for racial disparities in stroke. The case-cohort to be used for this study has available measures of inflammation and insulin resistance, making it uniquely well-suited to test our hypotheses. The results of these studies may have an important impact on the treatment and/or prevention of stroke and cognitive decline. Indeed, 25D deficiency and FGF23 excess are common in the general population, disproportionately impact blacks, and can be treated with safe and relatively inexpensive therapies. Thus, if vitamin D deficiency and excess FGF23 are risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, this would support intervention trials testing the treatment of these disorders in reducing rates of incident stroke and cognitive impairment, particularly among black individuals.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disorders of vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism are strongly linked to cardiovascular disease. The studies proposed herein will clarify the role of vitamin D deficiency and excess levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 in stroke, cognitive impairment, and racial disparities in these outcomes. Since vitamin D deficiency and elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 levels are common and disproportionately impact blacks, these studies may uncover novel therapeutic strategies for improving cerebrovascular outcomes in the general population, particularly among African Americans.              Disorders of vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism are strongly linked to cardiovascular disease.

"Center for Stroke Disaparities Solution     Description (provided by applicant): We seek to establish a Center for Stroke Disparities Solutions, as a consortium between three academic institutions (New York University School of Medicine; Columbia University Medical Center; and SUNY Downstate Medical School); five stroke centers and a practice-based research network of primary care practices within New York City's (NYC) Health and Hospital Corporation (HHC) - the largest municipal healthcare system in the U.S.; the Research Division of the Hebrew Home at Riverdale and the Visiting Nurse Service of New York - the largest nonprofit home healthcare organization in the US. The lead institution is New York University School of Medicine (NYUSOM) and the target communities are Black and Hispanic residents of NYC. The Center's vision is to reduce stroke disparities with a particular focus on prevention of recurrent stroke via: 1) implementation of evidence-based interventions targeted at aggressive management of hypertension among stroke survivors in community-based primary care practices and home healthcare settings; 2) dissemination of a novel, culturally-tailored community-based stroke health education; 3) training of minority investigators in stroke disparities research. The Center's vision will be achieved via the establishment of three cores and three research projects. The Administrative Core (Core A) will oversee all administrative, financial and dissemination activities. The Research Education and Training Plan (Core B) will train minority investigators at the junior faculty level to develop successful academic careers in stroke disparities research. The Research Core (Core C) will provide scientific support for the Center. Cores A and C will support all 3 projects: Project I: Practice-based Trial of Home BP Telemonitoring (HBPTM) Among Minority Stroke Survivors is a comparative effectiveness trial of the effects of HBPTM alone versus HBPTM plus telephonic nurse case management, on BP reduction and prevention of recurrent stroke. Project II: Stroke Community Transitions Intervention uses a mixed-methods design to evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally-tailored transition care program delivered by nurse practitioners and community health workers in improving BP control, functional outcomes and quality of life in homebound post-acute stroke patients. Project III: Tailored Approaches to Stroke Health Education uses a mixed-methods design to test the effectiveness of a novel culturally tailored intervention using storytelling (narrative persuasion) in increasing stroke literacy among adults in Black and Hispanic churches across NYC. All 3 projects address barriers that occur along the continuum of stroke care from the community to homecare, and primary care settings.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The vision of the Center for Stroke Disparities Solutions is to reduce stroke disparities with a particular focus on prevention of recurrent stroke.

"Regional & Racial Differences in Hemostasis & Risk of Stroke & Heart Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a 5-year research and training program for Dr. Neil A. Zakai (a junior faculty member at the University of Vermont) to develop an independent career in vascular epidemiology by investigating the impact hemostatic biomarker levels have on regional and racial differences in stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) in the 30,228 black and white individuals in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study (REGARDS).  Dr. Mary Cushman, an internationally recognized investigator in cardiovascular epidemiology, will serve as the principle mentor for this project. Though the period of this study, Dr. Cushman will support the educational and research aspects of this project. The advisory committee was selected from experts in epidemiology, neurology, and hematology to provide the best opportunities for networking and future collaborations. Dr. Zakai will meet with the advisory committee both in person and through teleconferences on a monthly basis. To achieve a future independent research career for Dr. Zakai, we propose specific coursework in epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Vermont and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  The project will be a case-cohort study focusing on the impact of multiple hemostatic biomarkers (both individually and in groups) on the regional and racial differences in stroke and CHD incidence in the United States. The specific aims will 1) create the nested case-cohort study within REGARDS, 2) use multivariable modeling and factor analysis to elucidate mechanisms for stroke and CHD and 3) integrate hemostatic biomarkers and traditional CVD risk factors into a model for stroke and CHD risk that can account for racial and/or regional differences in CVD.  The Laboratory for Clinical and Biochemical Research at the University of Vermont serves as an ideal setting to conduct this research by bringing together the laboratory aspects and the epidemiological expertise to ensure a rich translational research experience.

"Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/Intervention Research Program in Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/ Intervention Research Program in Health Disparities is a partnership of UCLA, four medical centers in the Los Angeles County safety net system, Healthy African American Families, and representatives from multiple community organizations serving low-income minority communities that span the Los Angeles basin. In this most diverse county in the US in race/ethnicity, we propose a multi-disciplinary, highly collaborative Program to create and test sustainable interventions to reduce or eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in the occurrence of stroke, and to generate new knowledge about mechanisms for such disparities. Project I creates a strong community-based component with community health workers and mobile health technology to create a full-fledged Chronic Care Model intervention that will be tested relative to usual care in 500 patients with a recent stroke seen in the Los Angeles County safety net. A cost analysis and a formative evaluation will guide development of a financial sustainability plan. Project II will elucidate the role of novel biological and social risk factors for stroke risk and trends over time, in a nationa data set.

"Effects of early exercise on muscle and cardiovascular health after stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke leads to profound physical deconditioning and abnormalities in paretic leg muscle including shift to fast twitch muscle phenotype, inflammation and gross atrophy that worsen cardiometabolic health by promoting insulin resistance. Yet, no prior studies have considered stroke as a catabolic syndrome in aging that can be modified by early exercise to improve muscle and cardiometabolic health. In chronic stroke, we have exercise models that improve mobility, restore fitness levels nearly 40%, and reverse impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and T2DM status in 58% of cases, even years after stroke. Lab findings suggest our exercise programs increase total myofibrillar protein and proportion of slow twitch in paretic leg muscle, implicating both altered protein synthesis and regulation of muscle molecular phenotype as mechanisms underlying the benefits of exercise post-stroke. This study investigates the hypothesis that in African-Jamaican adults with recent stroke, structured exercise across the sub-acute recovery period and into the chronic phase of stroke care will improve P leg muscle and cardiometabolic health, compared to controls receiving best medical care. Aims and associated hypotheses are to compare effects of 6 months structured and progressive exercise vs. best medical care implemented early after stroke in African-Jamaican adults on: Aim #1. Paretic & non-paretic leg mixed muscle protein synthesis and breakdown in the fed and fasted state, TNF-1 expression, thigh muscle volume and strength. Hypothesis 1: Paretic leg muscle has reduced protein synthesis and increased breakdown compared to non- paretic leg; Exercise will increase mixed muscle protein synthesis and reduce breakdown to increase muscle volume and strength by mechanism(s) of reducing inflammation in paretic leg, compared to controls. Aim #2. Glucose tolerance, fitness, and muscle phenotype. Hypothesis 2: Exercise will improve fitness levels, insulin and glucose response to oral glucose challenge, and increase paretic leg slow twitch muscle phenotype.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic hemiparetic stroke is associated changes in body composition, skeletal muscle and cardiometabolic health; specific changes include paretic limb muscular atrophy, increased intramuscular fat deposition, elevated prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes.

"Stroke Incidence and Risk Factors in a Tri-Ethnic Region    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke and cognitive impairment remain a major public health problem with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. The reasons for these race-ethnic disparities are not entirely clear. Improved detection and control of novel stroke risk factors are needed to reduce vascular disease burden. The Northern Manhattan prospective cohort consists of a population-based cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults enrolled since 2001 who have been followed annually for stroke, MI, and death. This collaborative study now involves faculty across 2 academic institutions and is the first prospective cohort study among whites, blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community. Over the last 5 years, the aims have expanded to include subclinical carotid, cardiac, and brain measures. High-resolution carotid imaging data has been assembled on 1770 subjects and a neuropsychological battery and standardized brain MRI will be completed on 1300 subjects with quantitative analyses to measure white matter hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds. This grant supports continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke, MI, and vascular death) and adiponectin, a new marker of obesity, new measures of subclinical carotid disease (carotid plaque area and densitometry), and quantitative MRI measures of vascular subclinical brain disease, as well as evaluate the impact on cognitive decline. To accomplish these aims, stored baseline plasma will be used to measure fasting adiponectin levels. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be quantitatively analyzed from standardized digital recordings. Repeat neuro-psychological testing emphasizing frontal-executive domains will be done on 1105 subjects. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive for any vascular event. Community stroke surveillance will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. The strengths of this cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of traditional and emerging risk factors, and the innovative assessment of MRI subclinical disease and carotid subclinical disease.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and coronary heart disease comprise two of the top three leading causes of death in the US and are of increasing importance in developing countries. While heart disease is the leading cause of death, stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. Stroke continues to have a disproportionate impact on mortality for blacks compared to whites. The aging and rapid growth of the black and Hispanic population has the potential to lead to future increases in the public health impact of stroke and vascular disease. The economic burden in the US due to stroke among Hispanics and blacks from 2005 to 2050 is projected to be $313 billion for Hispanics, and $379 billion for blacks.       Race-ethnic disparities are driven by differences in stroke incidence and vascular risk factors and have remained significant even after accounting for differences in socioeconomic status. Healthy People 2010 called for an elimination of race-ethnic disparities, but did not provide a clear method to achieve this lofty goal.       The principal goals of our study are to help fill the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of stroke and vascular disease particularly among blacks and Hispanics in order to improve future prevention efforts. We have broadened our focus to investigate markers of obesity, subclinical disease measures of the carotid arteries and brain, and predictors of vascular cognitive impairment and decline. We need to understand the importance of these conditions in predicting stroke, MI, vascular death, and determining cognitive decline among minority populations.

"Hispanic Stroke Prevention Intervention Research Program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanics are the largest minority group and by 2050 will be constitute 30% of the US population. Although Mexican Americans are the largest subgroup, Caribbean Hispanics are the second largest subgroup in the U.S. The aging and rapid growth of the Hispanic population will lead to increases in the impact of stroke. Innovative strategies are needed to reduce stroke risk and eliminate disparities among Hispanics. Our Hispanic Stroke Prevention Intervention Research Program is a collaborative application from the University of Miami and the University of Puerto Rico aimed at reducing stroke disparities in the Hispanic community. The central theme of our program is risk factor control among Hispanics at risk of stroke. In project I, we will assess in a randomized trial the effectiveness o an innovative secondary stroke prevention intervention program to improve the control of risk factors, uses a health care delivery model that has been successful for chronic disease management in minority communities, integrates pharmacists in the enhancement of adherence, and state of the art mobile information technology.

"Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Stroke has the largest racial disparity of any chronic disease, Geographic disparities also exist, and the magnitude of both disparities is increasing. Alarmingly, REGARDS has documented racial and geographic disparities in cognitive decline that are of the same magnitude as for stroke. A lack of understanding of the causes of these disparities has contributed directly to the failure to reduce or eliminate them.  REGARDS is a national cohort of 30,239 black and white community-dwelling participants aged 45+ when enrolled in 2003-2007. We propose to utilize the cohort to build on findings to date and extend our findings to evaluate new hypotheses. REGARDS is positioned to document disparities in incidence of stroke and cognitive impairment and also to understand why these disparities exist.  We propose to conduct a second in-person evaluation to define incidence and progression of stroke risk factors. We will continue stroke ascertainment to double the number of stroke events and improve our ability to define factors contributing to the as yet ""unexplained"" stroke disparities. By continuing cognitive assessments, and adding more sensitive in-person measures of cognitive function, and instrumental activities of daily living, we will advance the understanding of causes and clinical relevance of disparities in cognitive decline. We propose the following specific aims:  ¿ Specific Aim #1: to quantify incidence of, and change in severity of stroke risk factors over  9 years of follow-up, and to establish causes for racial and geographic disparities in these  risk factors.  ¿ Specific Aim #2: to evaluate three pathways that may account for ""unexplained"" disparities:  a) differential impact of risk factors where the same change in risk factor increases risk  more for one race than the other, b) residual confounding from incomplete characterization  of risk factors, and c) ""novel"" stroke risk factors including psychosocial and behavioral  factors.  ¿ Specific Aim #3: Measure the functional impact of cognitive impairment, estimate the  prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment over 10 years of follow-up, and account  for racial disparities in cognition attributable to literacy by gathering new information on  functional performance and word reading ability.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Estimates suggest that the racial and geographic disparities in stroke are associated with over 20,000 ""extra"" stroke events annually, with an estimated cost per stroke of $140,000; hence, the public health burden of these disparities is in excess of $6 billion dollars annually. If this research provides insights that would contribute to a 10% reduction in the magnitude of these disparities, the entire 5-year cost of this application would be recouped in savings in less than 16 days (a savings that would reoccur each 16 days).

"Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the highly successful Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project. BASIC is the only ongoing stroke surveillance project focusing on Mexican Americans. Mexican Americans are the largest segment of the Hispanic American population, the United States' largest minority group. Since the inception of this project in January 2000, we have assembled a cohort of over 4,992 cerebrovascular disease patients for whom we are able to follow for recurrent cerebrovascular events as well as mortality. This gives us tremendous power to detect associations with biological and social risk factors for stroke, important to Mexican Americans as well as the broader United States population. We have demonstrated increased stroke incidence and recurrence in Mexican Americans. Stroke severity and ischemic stroke subtypes are similar between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Mortality following stroke appears to be less in Mexican Americans. In the next five years we are positioned to delineate trends in stroke rates, and to explore the potential reasons for the increased stroke burden in Mexican Americans, as well as their improved survival. This information will be critically important to all populations to reduce the devastation of stroke. We will continue to make important observations useful for planning delivery of stroke care in communities. For the first time we will investigate functional and cognitive outcome following stroke in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We will now also study the role of health care quality and medication compliance on stroke outcomes. We will collect blood on all stroke patients useful for genetic studies by our group and others, and we have initiated stroke surveillance in a similar community within Mexico that will serve as a great basis for comparison to the Corpus Christi population. BASIC has been a very prolific study with more than 27 original peer-reviewed publications in the last four years alone. Indeed, this study is just beginning to provide the rich epidemiologic and clinical data that are necessary to control the epidemic of cerebrovascular disease in Mexican Americans. We know that the next five years will allow us to make contributions that will be directly useful for interventions to reduce health disparities, prevent stroke and improve stroke outcomes in all populations.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a competitive renewal for the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project. This highly successful community-based stroke epidemiology project seeks to understand the health disparity for stroke among Mexican Americans and non Hispanic whites in Corpus Christi, Texas.

High-resolution carotid imaging data has been assembled on 1770 subjects and a neuropsychological battery and standardized brain MRI will be completed on 1300 subjects with quantitative analyses to measure white matter hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds. This grant supports continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke, MI, and vascular death) and adiponectin, a new marker of obesity, new measures of subclinical carotid disease (carotid plaque area and densitometry), and quantitative MRI measures of vascular subclinical brain disease, as well as evaluate the impact on cognitive decline. To accomplish these aims, stored baseline plasma will be used to measure fasting adiponectin levels. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be quantitatively analyzed from standardized digital recordings. Repeat neuro-psychological testing emphasizing frontal-executive domains will be done on 1105 subjects. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive for any vascular event. Community stroke surveillance will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. The strengths of this cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of traditional and emerging risk factors, and the innovative assessment of MRI subclinical disease and carotid subclinical disease.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and coronary heart disease comprise two of the top three leading causes of death in the US and are of increasing importance in developing countries. While heart disease is the leading cause of death, stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. Stroke continues to have a disproportionate impact on mortality for blacks compared to whites. The aging and rapid growth of the black and Hispanic population has the potential to lead to future increases in the public health impact of stroke and vascular disease. The economic burden in the US due to stroke among Hispanics and blacks from 2005 to 2050 is projected to be $313 billion for Hispanics, and $379 billion for blacks.       Race-ethnic disparities are driven by differences in stroke incidence and vascular risk factors and have remained significant even after accounting for differences in socioeconomic status. Healthy People 2010 called for an elimination of race-ethnic disparities, but did not provide a clear method to achieve this lofty goal.       The principal goals of our study are to help fill the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of stroke and vascular disease particularly among blacks and Hispanics in order to improve future prevention efforts. We have broadened our focus to investigate markers of obesity, subclinical disease measures of the carotid arteries and brain, and predictors of vascular cognitive impairment and decline. We need to understand the importance of these conditions in predicting stroke, MI, vascular death, and determining cognitive decline among minority populations.

"A Community Partnership to Treat Stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans suffer a disproportionate number of strokes resulting in greater post-stroke disability and mortality compared to European Americans. Despite the fact that tissue plasminogen activase (tPA), decreases post-stroke morbidity, mortality and is cost saving, it is underutilized especially among African Americans who are up to one-fifth as likely to receive tPA as European Americans. The primary reason for the underutilization of acute stroke treatments is delayed patient presentation to the hospital which would be remedied by increasing prompt 911 calls for stroke. If all patients presented to the hospital immediately over 25% of stroke patients would receive tPA compared with the 1-3% that are currently treated. The long-term goal of this career development award is to promote the candidate's development into a clinical and research leader in behavioral interventions focusing on health disparities of neurologic disease. The aims of this project are 1)To develop and validate theory-based stroke education intervention materials and outcome measures that use simulated stroke patient video vignettes; 2)To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a faith-based, scientific theory-driven, peer-led behavioral intervention to increase stroke awareness and behavioral intent to call 911 among African American youth and adults in Flint, Michigan. This project is based on a partnership with Bridges into the Future, an African American faith-based community group in Flint, Michigan who will help to design and pre test novel intervention materials and outcome assessments. Then a single group repeated measures design feasibility study will be conducted to obtain preliminary evidence for the impact of our adapted intervention and to test the novel stroke outcome measure. The candidate is committed to a career as a rigorously trained clinician scientist and requires additional training in order to accomplish her long-term goal of reducing health disparities in neurologic disease via behavioral interventions. A detailed career development plan will promote the candidate's development of expertise in the science of behavioral interventions, advanced statistical analysis and an interdisciplinary understanding of health disparities. The career development plan consists of a multidisciplinary team of experts in each of these areas who will oversee a range of formal coursework, working meetings and practical experiences in these areas to ensure the candidate's future success. Excellent resources of a top university and a mentoring team with demonstrated success in developing junior investigators in these topic areas makes the University of Michigan an ideal environment for this project.        Getting to the hospital quickly is the key to treating stroke. African Americans suffer more strokes with worse outcomes and receive stroke treatments less often than European Americans. This project will work to reduce these health disparities by creating and testing the feasibility of a peer-led faith-based behavioral intervention in an African American community with a goal to increase calls to 911 so stroke patients can be treated quickly.

"Center for Stroke Disaparities Solution     Description (provided by applicant): We seek to establish a Center for Stroke Disparities Solutions, as a consortium between three academic institutions (New York University School of Medicine; Columbia University Medical Center; and SUNY Downstate Medical School); five stroke centers and a practice-based research network of primary care practices within New York City's (NYC) Health and Hospital Corporation (HHC) - the largest municipal healthcare system in the U.S.; the Research Division of the Hebrew Home at Riverdale and the Visiting Nurse Service of New York - the largest nonprofit home healthcare organization in the US. The lead institution is New York University School of Medicine (NYUSOM) and the target communities are Black and Hispanic residents of NYC. The Center's vision is to reduce stroke disparities with a particular focus on prevention of recurrent stroke via: 1) implementation of evidence-based interventions targeted at aggressive management of hypertension among stroke survivors in community-based primary care practices and home healthcare settings; 2) dissemination of a novel, culturally-tailored community-based stroke health education; 3) training of minority investigators in stroke disparities research. The Center's vision will be achieved via the establishment of three cores and three research projects. The Administrative Core (Core A) will oversee all administrative, financial and dissemination activities. The Research Education and Training Plan (Core B) will train minority investigators at the junior faculty level to develop successful academic careers in stroke disparities research. The Research Core (Core C) will provide scientific support for the Center. Cores A and C will support all 3 projects: Project I: Practice-based Trial of Home BP Telemonitoring (HBPTM) Among Minority Stroke Survivors is a comparative effectiveness trial of the effects of HBPTM alone versus HBPTM plus telephonic nurse case management, on BP reduction and prevention of recurrent stroke. Project II: Stroke Community Transitions Intervention uses a mixed-methods design to evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally-tailored transition care program delivered by nurse practitioners and community health workers in improving BP control, functional outcomes and quality of life in homebound post-acute stroke patients. Project III: Tailored Approaches to Stroke Health Education uses a mixed-methods design to test the effectiveness of a novel culturally tailored intervention using storytelling (narrative persuasion) in increasing stroke literacy among adults in Black and Hispanic churches across NYC.

"The Discovering Healthcare Innovations to Address Disparties in Stroke (DIADS) pr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans experience the highest rates of stroke of all race/ethnic groups In the US. Stroke in African American occurs at younger ages than Caucasians. While racial disparities in stroke exist at all ages, disparities are greatest in young adulthood. Temporal trend data suggest that these stroke disparities in young adulthood may be widening. Hypertension is the most common and potent risk factor for stroke in the US. Blood pressure (BP) control rates are known to differ by race and may be an important contributor to racial disparities in stroke. Disparities in blood pressure control are most prominent in younger adulthood, further contributing to disparities in stroke rates in this age group. Efforts aimed at the primary prevention of stroke have generally not focused on young adulthood, despite the greatest disparities in incident disease being observed in this period and the opportunity for long-term risk reduction via interventions targeted early in adulthood. Effective intervention targeting known stroke risk factors (e.g. hypertension) have not been developed for young adults. Additionally the literature on novel risk factors present in young adulthood that may be amenable to additional risk reduction is currently lacking. DIADS is collaboration between Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). DIADS seeks to design, implement, and evaluate a clinically-delivered hypertension control intervention that consists of both a clinical algorithm for rapid an effective blood BP control, as well as a culturally-tailored dietary Intervention aimed at more effective sustained BP control. Specific Aim 1: To conduct a cluster pragmatic randomized trial of a clinically-delivered hypertension control intervention (Shake, Rattle, and Roll) that will consist of a clinical algorithm for rapid and sustained blood pressure control, as well as a culturally tailored dietary intervention. Specific Aim 2: To conduct an observational cohort study of children, adolescents, and young adults within KPNC to identify temporal trends in traditional risk factors for stroke in the young, as well as novel factors that may Increase stroke risk in thi age group. Specific Aim 3: To implement the essential components of the Shake, Rattle, and Roll hypertension control intervention in a local community clinic serving a diverse population and then disseminate the intervention among a broad coalition of community clinics in Alameda County and San Francisco County. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood pressure control rates are known to differ by race and are likely be an important contributor to racial disparities in stroke, particularly for young Afrian American adults in whom a disturbing increase in stroke rates has occurred in recent years. The DIADS program will provide information that is likely to result in better understanding of stroke etiology in the young and a hypertension (HTN) treatment program that can reduce HTN control disparities and be disseminated widely, resulting in reduction of stroke disparities.            ",The Discovering Healthcare Innovations to Address Disparties in Stroke (DIADS) pr,8727760,U54NS081760,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Caucasians ', ' County ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' systolic hypertension ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' cardiovascular epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' experience ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP control ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' novel ', ' treatment program ', ' Population Study ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' nutritional epidemiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Training ', ' Public Health Instruction ', ' Public Health Education ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' trend ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' hypertension treatment ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' minority trainee ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' hypertension control ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NINDS,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U54,2013,88013,0.33445287211464764
"Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/Intervention Research Program in Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/ Intervention Research Program in Health Disparities is a partnership of UCLA, four medical centers in the Los Angeles County safety net system, Healthy African American Families, and representatives from multiple community organizations serving low-income minority communities that span the Los Angeles basin. In this most diverse county in the US in race/ethnicity, we propose a multi-disciplinary, highly collaborative Program to create and test sustainable interventions to reduce or eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in the occurrence of stroke, and to generate new knowledge about mechanisms for such disparities.

"Stroke Health and Risk Education (SHARE)  Abstract: Stroke is a disease with tremendous individual, family, and societal impact. It is the number one cause of adult disability and third leading cause of death in the United States. Between now and the year 2050, the cost of stroke in the United States will exceed 2 trillion dollars. There is a tremendous ethnic disparity with respect to stroke in the United States. Mexican Americans are much more likely to have a stroke compared with European Americans. In Mexican Americans strokes occur at younger ages, are more likely to recur and have the same severity as they do in European Americans. Mexican Americans are the overwhelming largest sub- population of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority group. This proposal, a scientifically-based rigorous behavioral education intervention trial, seeks to aggressively prevent stroke, especially in Mexican Americans. Faith and family are strong components of Mexican American culture. This project works with these positive fundamental elements in order to affect stroke prevention. This project will take place in Nueces County, Texas. The project investigators have worked in this community for the past 14 years and have published extensively regarding the stroke health disparity in this stable, non-immigrant community of Mexican Americans and European Americans. We have established a strong partnership with the Catholic Diocese of Corpus Christi and assembled a team with tremendous experience at successful health behavior intervention research. Together, a proposal has been crafted that will directly speak to aggressive stroke risk factor reduction in Mexican Americans and European Americans in this representative United States community. The significance of such research is tremendous. As the Mexican American population grows and ages, the stroke impact will be felt with greater and greater intensity. Now is the time to develop aggressive, scientifically tested interventions to limit the burden of this disease on this important segment of the United States population, and to reduce the costs of this disease to the country as a whole, in keeping with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) goal to ""identify culturally appropriate, effective stroke prevention programs for nationwide implementation in minority communities"" by FY2010.  Project Narrative Mexican Americans, the largest sub-population of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority group, have a higher risk of stroke than non-Hispanic whites. This proposal seeks to reduce stroke risk, especially in Mexican Americans, through a scientifically-based rigorous behavioral intervention trial.

"Sleep apnea health disparities in Mexican American stroke patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the US and a leading cause of death. Mexican Americans (MA), the largest subgroup of Hispanic Americans, have a substantially higher stroke risk than European Americans, especially at younger ages where the risk is more than double. Given the greater risk and earlier onset, the impact of stroke is disproportionately experienced by MAs. Reasons for increased stroke risk in MAs are poorly understood. More than half of ischemic stroke patients have sleep apnea, a very common and important risk factor for stroke and potentially a risk factor for poor stroke outcome. No published studies have established the prevalence of sleep apnea in MAs to discern sleep apnea's contribution to excess stroke burden in this population. Small studies conducted in academic medical centers have suggested that stroke patients with sleep apnea have particularly poor stroke outcomes, but population-based studies in diverse populations are lacking. The current application seeks to investigate health disparities related to sleep apnea in stroke patients in order to understand the marked ethnic differences in stroke. This research will inform the development of interventions to prevent or treat sleep apnea in MAs, which will reduce the ethnic stroke disparity. The parent study for this project, the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project, is an ongoing population-based stroke surveillance study that identifies stroke cases in Nueces County, Texas. This study has made many important discoveries about stroke in Hispanics. BASIC will continue to identify all strokes in Nueces County until mid year 3 of the current application and will provide detailed 90-day stroke outcome data until mid year 2. The current application will extend BASIC data collection through year 5 month 3 and will add: (1) sleep apnea screening in the acute stroke period that differentiates obstructive from central events, (2) sleep apnea screening for intracerebral hemorrhage cases, (3) access to care measures for sleep apnea, and (4) genetic admixture analysis to investigate how genetics may relate to ethnic disparities in sleep apnea. The application seeks, in a cost-containing fashion, to understand and remedy the influence of a very frequent risk factor, sleep apnea, on a common, devastating disease, stroke, in the largest and fastest growing US minority population.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep apnea is an important predictor of stroke and appears to be a predictor of poor outcomes after stroke. Using the preexisting infrastructure of the BASIC project, the current application will provide an assessment of health disparities related to sleep apnea in stroke patients. It will also allow for the rigorous study of ethnic comparisons of sleep apnea after stroke in European Americans and Hispanics, the largest minority in the United States.

"Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to continue our population-based study of stroke incidence, risk factors, treatment, and outcome of stroke within our biracial metropolitan population of 1,349,351, of whom 215,611 (15%) are of black race (US Census 2000). We have studied trends in stroke incidence and case fatality, as well as the prevalence of risk factors and knowledge of stroke (via a population survey) for almost 15 years and have demonstrated a racial disparity where stroke incidence in African-Americans is more than double that of whites. In addition to continuing these important activities, we propose an innovative pilot study that will be the largest prospective, population-based stroke outcomes study to date. The anticipated ~3,200 patients with strokes and 800 TIAs from our region in 2010, as well as the 2,000 surveyed participants, will be used to test the following hypotheses: 1. Temporal trends in the incidence rate of stroke will demonstrate a decrease over time in whites (as shown by our 2005 preliminary data). However, there will not be a similar decrease among blacks, a racial group that has not been examined in other temporal studies of stroke. We expect that case fatality rates will not change between periods, and will be similar for both blacks and whites. 2. A cohort of subjects followed by a regional HIE combined with phone-call follow-up will be more representative of the entire stroke population in our region than a cohort of subjects that agree to in-person interviews, which is likely to have participation and survival biases. Information obtained via this approach will be as valid as data from manual chart abstraction and direct interview for determining access to care and individual patients' functional outcome after stroke across a region, and will be more efficient to collect than that obtained via manual processes. 3. The proportion of the population that knows warning signs or risk factors for stroke will NOT improve between 2006 and 2011, based on our preliminary data. When subjects are asked about their own personal risk for stroke, a lower self-perceived risk will be associated with worse stroke knowledge.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The change in stroke occurrence over time is the ultimate test of how well science has translated new discoveries into benefits for the population. Our study has examined racial disparities in stroke over the last 15 years, showing that blacks have higher risk for stroke than whites. In our population, the occurrence of stroke is decreasing in whites but not African Americans, and we will continue to describe trends in stroke occurrence, cause, treatment, and outcome in a biracial metropolitan population.

"Caregiving and Health Care Utilization after Stroke among Medicare Beneficiaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States. Women and African Americans commonly have poorer functional outcomes after stroke, although the reasons for these gender and race differences are poorly understood. Some of the differential impact of stroke on women and African Americans might be explained by differential acute treatment and post-acute rehabilitative services, and by differential support of informal family caregivers. These factors have rarely been studied in representative population- based samples of stroke survivors. This application seeks funding to study these factors in a national sample of stroke survivors who are also Medicare beneficiaries. The Caring for Adults Recovering from the Effects of Stroke (CARES) study is an ancillary study of the national REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) project and is the only study of its kind that is systematically collecting long-term functional outcome data from the survivors of verified incident stroke events that are detected in a large-scale, prospective, epidemiologic investigation. Primary family caregivers are also enrolled in the CARES project, and to date, 210 stroke survivor/ family caregiver dyads have been enrolled. Most of these stroke survivors (N = 183, 87%) are traditional Medicare beneficiaires for whom Medicare claims data for the acute hospitalization and post-acute rehabilitative or recovery phase are available. Stroke survivor functional outcomes are assessed during structured in-home evaluations approximately one year after the incident stroke events, and stroke survivor and family caregiver psychosocial functioning and quality of life are assessed with structured telephone interviews beginning 9 months after the incident stroke event and continuing up to 3 years after the stroke event. As part of this proposed extension to the CARES project, we will expand our inclusion criteria to include more stroke survivors, including those without family caregivers, and our total sample size will increase to 420 stroke survivors, including 365 who are also traditional Medicare beneficiaries. While continuing to study outcome disparities among all stroke survivors, new specific aims are advanced in this proposal that focus on measures of health care utilization from the Medicare claims data. Most of the previous studies on care utilization after stroke and the long-term outcomes of stroke have not assessed the influences or experiences of informal family caregivers, and we hypothesize that differences in caregiver availability and involvement will partially explain previously observed gender and race differences in care utilization and functional outcomes. The CARES project is uniquely positioned to link demographic variables, stroke severity measures, post-stroke care utilization patterns, informal caregiving factors, and long-term functional outcomes in ways that will add new knowledge to the literature on why women and African Americans have poorer outcomes after stroke. The project will also advance our general understanding of how stroke affects both patients and their families more broadly.        Stroke is a common medical problem for older adults. Most of the formal rehabilitative care after stroke is covered by traditional Medicare claims, and most stroke patients also receive considerable informal care from close family members. The proposed research will examine the links between informal caregiving support, formal care utilization, and long-term stroke outcomes using a national epidemiologic sample. Caregiving supports during the acute hospitalization and post-acute rehabilitative phases are expected to differ by race and gender, and to partially account for previously observed race and gender differences in outcomes.

"The Discovering Healthcare Innovations to Address Disparties in Stroke (DIADS) pr     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans experience the highest rates of stroke of all race/ethnic groups In the US. Stroke in African American occurs at younger ages than Caucasians. While racial disparities in stroke exist at all ages, disparities are greatest in young adulthood. Temporal trend data suggest that these stroke disparities in young adulthood may be widening. Hypertension is the most common and potent risk factor for stroke in the US. Blood pressure (BP) control rates are known to differ by race and may be an important contributor to racial disparities in stroke. Disparities in blood pressure control are most prominent in younger adulthood, further contributing to disparities in stroke rates in this age group. Efforts aimed at the primary prevention of stroke have generally not focused on young adulthood, despite the greatest disparities in incident disease being observed in this period and the opportunity for long-term risk reduction via interventions targeted early in adulthood. Effective intervention targeting known stroke risk factors (e.g. hypertension) have not been developed for young adults. Additionally the literature on novel risk factors present in young adulthood that may be amenable to additional risk reduction is currently lacking. DIADS is collaboration between Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). DIADS seeks to design, implement, and evaluate a clinically-delivered hypertension control intervention that consists of both a clinical algorithm for rapid an effective blood BP control, as well as a culturally-tailored dietary Intervention aimed at more effective sustained BP control. Specific Aim 1: To conduct a cluster pragmatic randomized trial of a clinically-delivered hypertension control intervention (Shake, Rattle, and Roll) that will consist of a clinical algorithm for rapid and sustained blood pressure control, as well as a culturally tailored dietary intervention. Specific Aim 2: To conduct an observational cohort study of children, adolescents, and young adults within KPNC to identify temporal trends in traditional risk factors for stroke in the young, as well as novel factors that may Increase stroke risk in thi age group. Specific Aim 3: To implement the essential components of the Shake, Rattle, and Roll hypertension control intervention in a local community clinic serving a diverse population and then disseminate the intervention among a broad coalition of community clinics in Alameda County and San Francisco County.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood pressure control rates are known to differ by race and are likely be an important contributor to racial disparities in stroke, particularly for young Afrian American adults in whom a disturbing increase in stroke rates has occurred in recent years. The DIADS program will provide information that is likely to result in better understanding of stroke etiology in the young and a hypertension (HTN) treatment program that can reduce HTN control disparities and be disseminated widely, resulting in reduction of stroke disparities.            ",The Discovering Healthcare Innovations to Address Disparties in Stroke (DIADS) pr,8551790,U54NS081760,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Caucasians ', ' County ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' systolic hypertension ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' cardiovascular epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' experience ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP control ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' novel ', ' treatment program ', ' Population Study ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' nutritional epidemiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Training ', ' Public Health Instruction ', ' Public Health Education ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' trend ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' hypertension treatment ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' minority trainee ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' hypertension control ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NINDS,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U54,2013,2697606,0.33445287211464764

"Impact of disordered mineral metabolism on stroke and cognitive impairment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke and cognitive impairment are major causes of death and disability in the US and disproportionately impact blacks. While traditional stroke risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes contribute to racial disparities in cerebrovascular outcomes, they are not sufficient to completely explain these findings, suggesting that non-traditional risk factors play an important role. Disturbances in vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism have emerged as non-traditional risk factors for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels are associated with heart disease and death via broad effects on inflammation, insulin resistance and blood pressure control. Disturbances in phosphorus metabolism stimulate the secretion of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a bone-derived hormone that maintains phosphorus homeostasis in part by inhibiting the conversion of 25D to its activated metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). Our group and others showed that higher FGF23 levels were associated with adverse outcomes through direct and indirect effects promoting cardiovascular disease and 1,25D deficiency. Moreover, preliminary data from our group suggest that low vitamin D is an independent risk factor for stroke and cognitive impairment. The primary focus of the current proposal is to build upon this prior work by determining whether low plasma 25D levels and excess plasma FGF23 levels are associated with incident stroke and cognitive impairment in a large, national cohort (Aim 1). In addition, since disorders of vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism are more common and severe in blacks than whites, we will determine if they partly underlie racial disparities in stroke (Aim 2). Finally, given that inflammation, insulin resistance and hypertension are key risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, and are interconnected with disturbances in vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism, we will determine whether they partly mediate the associations of 25D and FGF23 with stroke and cognitive decline. We will test these hypotheses by measuring plasma 25D, FGF23 and other key mediators of mineral metabolism including 1,25D, parathyroid hormone, calcium and phosphate in stored blood samples from a specified case cohort of 2,085 participants of the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, a national prospective study of black and white adults designed to identify novel risk factors for racial disparities in stroke. The case-cohort to be used for this study has available measures of inflammation and insulin resistance, making it uniquely well-suited to test our hypotheses. The results of these studies may have an important impact on the treatment and/or prevention of stroke and cognitive decline. Indeed, 25D deficiency and FGF23 excess are common in the general population, disproportionately impact blacks, and can be treated with safe and relatively inexpensive therapies. Thus, if vitamin D deficiency and excess FGF23 are risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, this would support intervention trials testing the treatment of these disorders in reducing rates of incident stroke and cognitive impairment, particularly among black individuals.          Disorders of vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism are strongly linked to cardiovascular disease. The studies proposed herein will clarify the role of vitamin D deficiency and excess levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 in stroke, cognitive impairment, and racial disparities in these outcomes. Since vitamin D deficiency and elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 levels are common and disproportionately impact blacks, these studies may uncover novel therapeutic strategies for improving cerebrovascular outcomes in the general population, particularly among African Americans.

"Examining Racial Disparities in Stroke     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the 4th leading cause of US mortality and 3rd among African Americans, with African Americans exhibiting more than twice the risk of Whites. The underlying causes of racial disparities in stroke are unclear. Few studies have systematically evaluated how racial disparities in stroke might vary by socioeconomic and behavior risk factors (e.g. measures of socioeconomic status [SES], adiposity, physical activity and alcohol) and they might explain the observed disparities through their roles as intermediates in the causal pathway between race and stroke. There has been a paucity of research on the impact of socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors in stroke risk prediction. Moreover, validation of existing stroke prediction scores among African Americans is urgently needed. This innovative project will address these gaps in the literature by: (1) determining whether racial disparities in stroke and the associations of selected stroke risk factors by race are comparable in two biracial socioeconomically heterogeneous populations, (2) determining whether mediation by socioeconomic and behavioral stroke risk factors account for racial disparities in stroke beyond traditional stroke risk factors using conventional and causal frameworks, and (3) examining whether race-specific stroke prediction models improve the predictive performance (calibration and discrimination) of long-term stroke risk compared to existing stroke prediction models. These aims will be accomplished through the use of three multi-racial, well-established NIH-funded cohorts; the Women's Health Initiative, Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) and Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke.  A comprehensive approach to examining racial disparities will be utilized. Novel causal mediation analyses will complement conventional epidemiologic methods and move the field forward. Furthermore, race-specific stroke prediction models will enable the development of improved prevention strategies among at-risk individuals. These socioeconomic and behavioral stroke risk factors are often routinely collected in the clinic or could be obtained at minimal cost. This grant will generate new knowledge and crucial training for my advancement to become an independent epidemiologist in the field of racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) by developing my expertise in (1) racial disparities and social determinant of CVD; (2) statistical training in mediation analyses; (3) methodologic training in prediction modeling; (4) data management and analytic skills with Medicare claims data (CMS) for stroke ascertainment in SCCS and (5) pilot medical record collection for stroke validation in SCCS. The advanced training, mentorship and protected time provided by this career development award will provide the skills and experience necessary for conducting the highest quality racial/ethnic cardiovascular disparities research and a strong foundation for success as an independent epidemiologic racial/disparities investigator.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the 4th leading cause of US mortality and 3rd among African Americans, with African Americans exhibiting more than twice the risk of Whites. This proposal will increase our understanding of differences in risk of stroke by race, providing insight into new approaches for prevention and elimination of racial disparities in stroke. By examining the contribution of socioeconomic and behavioral stroke risk factors (measures of SES, adiposity, physical activity and alcohol) to racial disparities in stroke, this proposal will advance knowledge and suggest target areas to decrease disparities, while the limitations of existing prediction scores will be addressed by the development of race-specific risk models which may assist in prevention strategies.            ",Examining Racial Disparities in Stroke,8750945,K01HL124391,"['Accounting ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Calibration ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' systolic hypertension ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Smoking History ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2014,130086,0.4368614940776495

"Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/Intervention Research Program in Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/ Intervention Research Program in Health Disparities is a partnership of UCLA, four medical centers in the Los Angeles County safety net system, Healthy African American Families, and representatives from multiple community organizations serving low-income minority communities that span the Los Angeles basin. In this most diverse county in the US in race/ethnicity, we propose a multi-disciplinary, highly collaborative Program to create and test sustainable interventions to reduce or eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in the occurrence of stroke, and to generate new knowledge about mechanisms for such disparities. Project I creates a strong community-based component with community health workers and mobile health technology to create a full-fledged Chronic Care Model intervention that will be tested relative to usual care in 500 patients with a recent stroke seen in the Los Angeles County safety net. A cost analysis and a formative evaluation will guide development of a financial sustainability plan. Project II will elucidate the role of novel biological and social risk factors for stroke risk and trends over time, in a nationa data set. Project III builds on an existing close partnership with the City of Los Angeles Department of Aging to develop and test a culturally-tailored behavioral stroke risk factor reduction/walking intervention - delivered by senior center staff-with 240 high risk seniors from Korean, Chinese, African-American and Hispanic racial/ethnic groups. Four cores include an Administrative Core A that supports all three projects; a Research Education and Training Core B that will recruit, retain, and develop stroke disparities-relevant curriculum for academic researchers, community research support personnel and other community stake holders; a Biomarker Collection and Analysis Core C to support Project I and III biomarker data collection, consulting for all three projects, and development of educational programming on biomarkers; and a Community Engagement, Outreach, and Dissemination Core D that supports and interacts with all three projects by promoting and sustaining community-academic partnerships through bidirectional knowledge sharing and by creating strategies for disseminating advances in knowledge about stroke prevention disparities research through outreach to affected communities locally and nationally. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A coordinated effort of researchers and community partners is needed to reduce or eliminate the higher rates of stroke among low-income Latinos, African-Americans, and Asian Americans in underserved communities.

"The Discovering Healthcare Innovations to Address Disparties in Stroke (DIADS) pr     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans experience the highest rates of stroke of all race/ethnic groups In the US. Stroke in African American occurs at younger ages than Caucasians. While racial disparities in stroke exist at all ages, disparities are greatest in young adulthood. Temporal trend data suggest that these stroke disparities in young adulthood may be widening. Hypertension is the most common and potent risk factor for stroke in the US. Blood pressure (BP) control rates are known to differ by race and may be an important contributor to racial disparities in stroke. Disparities in blood pressure control are most prominent in younger adulthood, further contributing to disparities in stroke rates in this age group. Efforts aimed at the primary prevention of stroke have generally not focused on young adulthood, despite the greatest disparities in incident disease being observed in this period and the opportunity for long-term risk reduction via interventions targeted early in adulthood. Effective intervention targeting known stroke risk factors (e.g. hypertension) have not been developed for young adults. Additionally the literature on novel risk factors present in young adulthood that may be amenable to additional risk reduction is currently lacking. DIADS is collaboration between Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). DIADS seeks to design, implement, and evaluate a clinically-delivered hypertension control intervention that consists of both a clinical algorithm for rapid an effective blood BP control, as well as a culturally-tailored dietary Intervention aimed at more effective sustained BP control. Specific Aim 1: To conduct a cluster pragmatic randomized trial of a clinically-delivered hypertension control intervention (Shake, Rattle, and Roll) that will consist of a clinical algorithm for rapid and sustained blood pressure control, as well as a culturally tailored dietary intervention. Specific Aim 2: To conduct an observational cohort study of children, adolescents, and young adults within KPNC to identify temporal trends in traditional risk factors for stroke in the young, as well as novel factors that may Increase stroke risk in thi age group. Specific Aim 3: To implement the essential components of the Shake, Rattle, and Roll hypertension control intervention in a local community clinic serving a diverse population and then disseminate the intervention among a broad coalition of community clinics in Alameda County and San Francisco County.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood pressure control rates are known to differ by race and are likely be an important contributor to racial disparities in stroke, particularly for young Afrian American adults in whom a disturbing increase in stroke rates has occurred in recent years. The DIADS program will provide information that is likely to result in better understanding of stroke etiology in the young and a hypertension (HTN) treatment program that can reduce HTN control disparities and be disseminated widely, resulting in reduction of stroke disparities.            ",The Discovering Healthcare Innovations to Address Disparties in Stroke (DIADS) pr,8727678,U54NS081760,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Caucasians ', ' County ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' systolic hypertension ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' cardiovascular epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' experience ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP control ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' novel ', ' treatment program ', ' Population Study ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' nutritional epidemiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Training ', ' Public Health Instruction ', ' Public Health Education ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' trend ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' hypertension treatment ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' minority trainee ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' hypertension control ', ' randomized trial ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' ']",NINDS,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U54,2014,2580271,0.33445287211464764
"Reducing Racial Disparities in Post-Stroke Disability in the Elderly     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is common, nearly 800,000 strokes occur annually, and a leading cause of disability in the U.S. Non-Hispanic Black/African American (Black) adults have the highest stroke prevalence and suffer the most post-stroke disability of any U.S. racial/ethnic group. Even though racial disparities in post-stroke disability are widespread, little it is known about how to reduce this disparity. Racial differences in disability arise in the post-stroke period; however it is unclear if these differences arise shortly after strke in the early recovery period, when many stroke survivors are undergoing rehabilitation, or after stroke survivors return to the community. This project will address the critical questions of when racial disparities in post-stroke disability arise and determine the drivers of this disparity in ech period. Answering these questions is an essential step to designing interventions to improve health in Black stroke survivors and reduce disparities. To address these questions, we will rely on the newly available National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) linked to Medicare claims and functional assessment data. NHATS is a national, longitudinal survey of Medicare beneficiaries focused on understanding the causes and consequences of disability in the elderly. NHATS performs annual face-to-face interviews to carefully characterize disability in the elderly and measures a vast array of disability predictors including social, community and disability accommodation factors. Additionally NHATS's linkage to Medicare claims will enable measurement of important medical and rehabilitation factors that may also explain racial differences in post-stroke disability. These data sources will be used to develop the first comprehensive measures of rehabilitation intensity across all rehabilitation settings-home health, outpatient, skilled nursing and inpatient rehabilitation-compare intensity by race and estimate the effect of rehabilitation intensity on disability disparities. At the completion of the study, the timing and drivers of race differences in post-stroke disability will be identified. Furthermore, our novel measures of rehabilitation intensity can serve as a prototype for use in studying the role of rehabilitation in other diseases such as traumatic brain injury and arthritis. This proposal is particularly responsive to the NIMHD solicitation in that it focuses on modifiable drivers of racial differences in post-stroke disability from a policy standpoint and will directly inform stroke survivor and family level strategies to reduce disability and decrease disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-Hispanic Black/African American (Black) adults have more strokes and experience greater disability after their strokes than non-Hispanic White adults. Using newly available data, this project will determine the time when racial differences in post-stroke disability arise and the factors that lead to racial differences in post- stroke disabiity. These results will be directly used to develop strategies and interventions to improve the health of Black stroke survivors and reduce disparities.                ",Reducing Racial Disparities in Post-Stroke Disability in the Elderly,8769828,R01MD008879,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Arthritis ', ' Attention ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Home Health Agency ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Extended Care Facilities ', ' Skilled Nursing Facilities ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Transportation ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Life ', ' social rehab ', ' social rehabilitation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic encephalopathy ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' trend ', ' Modification ', ' beneficiary ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' community living ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' Medicare claim ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,388750,0.22415093848868395
"Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Stroke has the largest racial disparity of any chronic disease, Geographic disparities also exist, and the magnitude of both disparities is increasing. Alarmingly, REGARDS has documented racial and geographic disparities in cognitive decline that are of the same magnitude as for stroke. A lack of understanding of the causes of these disparities has contributed directly to the failure to reduce or eliminate them.  REGARDS is a national cohort of 30,239 black and white community-dwelling participants aged 45+ when enrolled in 2003-2007. We propose to utilize the cohort to build on findings to date and extend our findings to evaluate new hypotheses. REGARDS is positioned to document disparities in incidence of stroke and cognitive impairment and also to understand why these disparities exist.  We propose to conduct a second in-person evaluation to define incidence and progression of stroke risk factors. We will continue stroke ascertainment to double the number of stroke events and improve our ability to define factors contributing to the as yet ""unexplained"" stroke disparities. By continuing cognitive assessments, and adding more sensitive in-person measures of cognitive function, and instrumental activities of daily living, we will advance the understanding of causes and clinical relevance of disparities in cognitive decline. We propose the following specific aims:  ¿ Specific Aim #1: to quantify incidence of, and change in severity of stroke risk factors over  9 years of follow-up, and to establish causes for racial and geographic disparities in these  risk factors.  ¿ Specific Aim #2: to evaluate three pathways that may account for ""unexplained"" disparities:  a) differential impact of risk factors where the same change in risk factor increases risk  more for one race than the other, b) residual confounding from incomplete characterization  of risk factors, and c) ""novel"" stroke risk factors including psychosocial and behavioral  factors.  ¿ Specific Aim #3: Measure the functional impact of cognitive impairment, estimate the  prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment over 10 years of follow-up, and account  for racial disparities in cognition attributable to literacy by gathering new information on  functional performance and word reading ability.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Estimates suggest that the racial and geographic disparities in stroke are associated with over 20,000 ""extra"" stroke events annually, with an estimated cost per stroke of $140,000; hence, the public health burden of these disparities is in excess of $6 billion dollars annually. If this research provides insights that would contribute to a 10% reduction in the magnitude of these disparities, the entire 5-year cost of this application would be recouped in savings in less than 16 days (a savings that would reoccur each 16 days).

"Hispanic Stroke Prevention Intervention Research Program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanics are the largest minority group and by 2050 will be constitute 30% of the US population. Although Mexican Americans are the largest subgroup, Caribbean Hispanics are the second largest subgroup in the U.S. The aging and rapid growth of the Hispanic population will lead to increases in the impact of stroke. Innovative strategies are needed to reduce stroke risk and eliminate disparities among Hispanics. Our Hispanic Stroke Prevention Intervention Research Program is a collaborative application from the University of Miami and the University of Puerto Rico aimed at reducing stroke disparities in the Hispanic community. The central theme of our program is risk factor control among Hispanics at risk of stroke. In project I, we will assess in a randomized trial the effectiveness o an innovative secondary stroke prevention intervention program to improve the control of risk factors, uses a health care delivery model that has been successful for chronic disease management in minority communities, integrates pharmacists in the enhancement of adherence, and state of the art mobile information technology. In project II, we will systematically evaluate the determinants of blood pressure variability and glucose control among high-risk Hispanic family members of stroke patients. We will assess novel psychosocial, sociocultural, healthcare system, and biological variables as part of a conceptual model that incorporates psychosocial adversities, reserve capacity, and cumulative vulnerabilities as determinants of 24hour blood pressure variability. In project III we will create the Florida Puerto Rico Stroke Registry by collating data from 140 hospitals that are currently collecting Get With the Guidelines-Stroke data to help identify stroke disparities by race, ethnicity, and region and educate stakeholders in approaches to improve stroke quality regarding stroke disparities. Our program includes three cores: administrative core, the research/education training core, and the data management and statistics core.

"Effects of early exercise on muscle and cardiovascular health after stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke leads to profound physical deconditioning and abnormalities in paretic leg muscle including shift to fast twitch muscle phenotype, inflammation and gross atrophy that worsen cardiometabolic health by promoting insulin resistance. Yet, no prior studies have considered stroke as a catabolic syndrome in aging that can be modified by early exercise to improve muscle and cardiometabolic health. In chronic stroke, we have exercise models that improve mobility, restore fitness levels nearly 40%, and reverse impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and T2DM status in 58% of cases, even years after stroke. Lab findings suggest our exercise programs increase total myofibrillar protein and proportion of slow twitch in paretic leg muscle, implicating both altered protein synthesis and regulation of muscle molecular phenotype as mechanisms underlying the benefits of exercise post-stroke. This study investigates the hypothesis that in African-Jamaican adults with recent stroke, structured exercise across the sub-acute recovery period and into the chronic phase of stroke care will improve P leg muscle and cardiometabolic health, compared to controls receiving best medical care. Aims and associated hypotheses are to compare effects of 6 months structured and progressive exercise vs. best medical care implemented early after stroke in African-Jamaican adults on: Aim #1. Paretic & non-paretic leg mixed muscle protein synthesis and breakdown in the fed and fasted state, TNF-1 expression, thigh muscle volume and strength. Hypothesis 1: Paretic leg muscle has reduced protein synthesis and increased breakdown compared to non- paretic leg; Exercise will increase mixed muscle protein synthesis and reduce breakdown to increase muscle volume and strength by mechanism(s) of reducing inflammation in paretic leg, compared to controls. Aim #2. Glucose tolerance, fitness, and muscle phenotype. Hypothesis 2: Exercise will improve fitness levels, insulin and glucose response to oral glucose challenge, and increase paretic leg slow twitch muscle phenotype.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic hemiparetic stroke is associated changes in body composition, skeletal muscle and cardiometabolic health; specific changes include paretic limb muscular atrophy, increased intramuscular fat deposition, elevated prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. This randomized intervention study compares a 6 month task oriented exercise programs versus control with both groups receiving best medical stroke care according to American Stroke Association ""Get with the Guidelines"". The hypothesis is that is 6 months of task-oriented exercise initiated early across the sub-acute period of stroke can prevent or ameliorate the natural course of these body composition, skeletal muscle and cardiometabolic health changes.

"Developing a system to study stroke rehabilitation in an ethnically diverse community     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mexican Americans (MAs) suffer more from stroke than non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). Ischemic stroke is more common in MAs and their neurologic, functional and cognitive outcomes after stroke are worse than in NHWs. The reasons for the disparity in post-stroke outcome are unclear. Pre-stroke function and initial stroke severity are similar between the two groups as are ischemic stroke sub-types. One potential explanation for the worse post-stroke neurologic, functional and cognitive outcome in MAs compared with NHWs is allocation and effectiveness of post-stroke rehabilitation. There is remarkably little data demonstrating whether rehabilitation is dosed differently for MAs compared with NHWs, and still less information about whether, for a given dose of rehabilitative services following stroke, there is differential benefit by ethnicity. The current application will utilize the existing population-based Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC, NSR0138916) project's infrastructure and strong community relations to develop and pilot a method to collect the necessary data to determine the role of rehabilitation in ethnic disparities in post-stroke outcomes. Previous studies have suggested that looking at overall time spent in rehabilitation does not predict post-stroke outcome. However, specific components of physical, occupational and speech therapy, a practice-based approach, has been shown to be associated with stroke outcomes, and these associations have been shown to vary by race. However, this practice-based approach has not been implemented in a population-based manner across the range of settings where stroke patients receive rehabilitation services, and no study has used this approach in an ethnically diverse population. Therefore, our plan is to build on previous work by developing and utilizing a practice-based design in our population-based stroke study. Specifically, we will 1) continue to build the needed relationships with rehabilitation service providers in the community; 2) work with local rehabilitation therapists to refine data collection instruments as part of the practice-based design; 3) pilot test data collection of specific rehabilitation components of post-stroke rehabilitation across all rehabilitation settings; and 4) analyze this data to determine the feasibility of this approach for a larger study and to provide preliminary data on differences in access and effectiveness by ethnicity. In total, our infrastructure development, refinement of tools to measure specific therapy modalities and pilot testing will position us perfectly to submit an R01 application to identify ethnic differences in access to rehabilitation and specific rehabilitation services associated with improved functional outcome in MAs and NHWs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop the infrastructure and pilot test a framework to understand rehabilitation after stroke among Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites in a population-based study.

"Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/Intervention Research Program in Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/ Intervention Research Program in Health Disparities is a partnership of UCLA, four medical centers in the Los Angeles County safety net system, Healthy African American Families, and representatives from multiple community organizations serving low-income minority communities that span the Los Angeles basin. In this most diverse county in the US in race/ethnicity, we propose a multi-disciplinary, highly collaborative Program to create and test sustainable interventions to reduce or eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in the occurrence of stroke, and to generate new knowledge about mechanisms for such disparities. Project I creates a strong community-based component with community health workers and mobile health technology to create a full-fledged Chronic Care Model intervention that will be tested relative to usual care in 500 patients with a recent stroke seen in the Los Angeles County safety net. A cost analysis and a formative evaluation will guide development of a financial sustainability plan. Project II will elucidate the role of novel biological and social risk factors for stroke risk and trends over time, in a nationa data set. Project III builds on an existing close partnership with the City of Los Angeles Department of Aging to develop and test a culturally-tailored behavioral stroke risk factor reduction/walking intervention - delivered by senior center staff-with 240 high risk seniors from Korean, Chinese, African-American and Hispanic racial/ethnic groups. Four cores include an Administrative Core A that supports all three projects; a Research Education and Training Core B that will recruit, retain, and develop stroke disparities-relevant curriculum for academic researchers, community research support personnel and other community stake holders; a Biomarker Collection and Analysis Core C to support Project I and III biomarker data collection, consulting for all three projects, and development of educational programming on biomarkers; and a Community Engagement, Outreach, and Dissemination Core D that supports and interacts with all three projects by promoting and sustaining community-academic partnerships through bidirectional knowledge sharing and by creating strategies for disseminating advances in knowledge about stroke prevention disparities research through outreach to affected communities locally and nationally.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A coordinated effort of researchers and community partners is needed to reduce or eliminate the higher rates of stroke among low-income Latinos, African-Americans, and Asian Americans in underserved communities.

"Center for Stroke Disaparities Solution     Description (provided by applicant): We seek to establish a Center for Stroke Disparities Solutions, as a consortium between three academic institutions (New York University School of Medicine; Columbia University Medical Center; and SUNY Downstate Medical School); five stroke centers and a practice-based research network of primary care practices within New York City's (NYC) Health and Hospital Corporation (HHC) - the largest municipal healthcare system in the U.S.; the Research Division of the Hebrew Home at Riverdale and the Visiting Nurse Service of New York - the largest nonprofit home healthcare organization in the US. The lead institution is New York University School of Medicine (NYUSOM) and the target communities are Black and Hispanic residents of NYC. The Center's vision is to reduce stroke disparities with a particular focus on prevention of recurrent stroke via: 1) implementation of evidence-based interventions targeted at aggressive management of hypertension among stroke survivors in community-based primary care practices and home healthcare settings; 2) dissemination of a novel, culturally-tailored community-based stroke health education; 3) training of minority investigators in stroke disparities research. The Center's vision will be achieved via the establishment of three cores and three research projects. The Administrative Core (Core A) will oversee all administrative, financial and dissemination activities. The Research Education and Training Plan (Core B) will train minority investigators at the junior faculty level to develop successful academic careers in stroke disparities research. The Research Core (Core C) will provide scientific support for the Center. Cores A and C will support all 3 projects: Project I: Practice-based Trial of Home BP Telemonitoring (HBPTM) Among Minority Stroke Survivors is a comparative effectiveness trial of the effects of HBPTM alone versus HBPTM plus telephonic nurse case management, on BP reduction and prevention of recurrent stroke. Project II: Stroke Community Transitions Intervention uses a mixed-methods design to evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally-tailored transition care program delivered by nurse practitioners and community health workers in improving BP control, functional outcomes and quality of life in homebound post-acute stroke patients. Project III: Tailored Approaches to Stroke Health Education uses a mixed-methods design to test the effectiveness of a novel culturally tailored intervention using storytelling (narrative persuasion) in increasing stroke literacy among adults in Black and Hispanic churches across NYC.

"Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mexican Americans are the most numerous sub-group of Hispanic Americans, the largest minority population in the United States. This important group is aging and growing rapidly. For the past 14 years the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project has provided rich original stroke disparities research comparing Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. BASIC remains the only means to monitor stroke trends and to investigate stroke outcomes in Mexican Americans. BASIC has demonstrated that stroke incidence is higher in Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites. New stroke incidence data from BASIC show that the disparity remains completely unabated over the last decade. Further, stroke onset occurs at younger ages in Mexican Americans providing more years of disability. This contributes to a substantial increased cost for stroke in Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites. Remarkable new data from BASIC suggests that the previously seen Mexican American survival advantage post-stroke is disappearing. Further, Mexican American stroke survivors have worse neurologic and functional outcomes. Thus, BASIC data suggests that in 2013 Mexican Americans have more strokes, occurring at younger ages, and experience far greater post- stroke disability than non-Hispanic whites. The current proposal seeks to continue to provide rigorous stroke surveillance to monitor stroke trends in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We further propose to provide new longer-term (six month and one year) stroke outcome data to provide crucial information on the time course and changes in neurologic, functional, cognitive, and quality of life outcomes post-stroke in both ethnic groups. Additionally, since post-stroke disability appears much worse in Mexican Americans, we plan to delve deeply into the structure of informal caregiving post-stroke and understand the needs of stroke survivors and the role of families in addressing these needs. This data on the social/family context in which stroke survivors function will be crucial for designing intervention to improve stroke outcome. Finally, the definition of stroke will be studied to understand the impact on measures of stroke burden derived from an ethnically diverse population-based study. BASIC has published over 55 original, peer-reviewed manuscripts, spun-off 5 R-level grants and served as the foundation for training numerous diverse students. In this next cycle, we are poised and deeply committed to provide a fundamental understanding of long-term stroke trends, outcome studies, and informal caregiving structure, as well as continuing to provide key clinical observations such as the impact of the new stroke definition. This work is absolutely critical to Mexican Americans, a growing, aging and large minority population that will increasingly feel the impact from stroke in the next decade. Indeed, this work is also critical to clinicians and public health planners as BASIC continues to offer key observations on stroke and Mexican American health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to monitor and understand the tremendous stroke disparity among Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Stroke incidence, recurrence, mortality, and, in survivors, neurologic, functional and cognitive outcomes will be compared among the ethnic groups. Informal caregiving structure will be studied to improve services and tailor interventions for stroke survivors and families to improve stroke outcome and prevent second stroke.            ",Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project,8694264,R01NS038916,"['Age ', ' Aging ', ' American Heart Association ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Incidence ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Survivors ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' ethnic difference ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' stroke recovery ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,708185,0.35564741078733175
"The University of Iowa's Statewide Stroke Research Network     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of lowa (Ul) Statewide Stroke Research Network meets the goal of the NINDS Stroke Trials Network of maximizing efficiencies in developing, promoting, and conducting high quality multi-site clinical trials on stroke prevention, treatment, and recovery. The current proposal builds on the rich tradition of the Ul as a leader in both developing and conducting NINDS-sponsored research, as well as on the Ul's role as the hub of a new integrated health care network - The Ul Health Alliance. The long-term goals of this proposal are to improve the efficiency of conducting Phase I - III stroke trials and to ensure a robust pipeline of well-trained clinical investigators to lead such trials. he proposal's immediate goal is to establish an expanded statewide research network for conducting stroke trials that reaches underserved rural patients who currently are unable to participate in stroke trials due to geographical barriers and who are subject to disparities in health outcomes. The proposed University of lowa Regional Coordinating Center (UIRCC) represents a comprehensive and integrated infrastructure for conducting trials that brings together healthcare providers, hospital administrators, clinical and health service investigators, public health officials, and patient advocates. The UIRCC comprises a network that expands the research capabilities of the Ul to 12 trial-ready sites. Those hospitals will be supplied by a statewide infrastructure of spokes that will allow adequate representation in trials of those Americans first evaluated at critical access hospitals. The UIRCC will capitalize on prior work by the PI to improve recruitment of patients presenting to critical access hospitals and maximize geographic access of patients. The feasibility of this approach is supported by the ongoing research data sharing collaboration, and a strong institutional support from the statewide healthcare alliance. We have plans already in place to expand this statewide network model to Nebraska and to the Dakotas. The UIRCC will also develop innovative translational research proposals that will lead to multicenter clinical trials through the NINDS stroke network by bringing together clinicians, early stage (i.e., bench to bedside) translational investigators, clinical trialists, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and geographers to develop proposals of new approaches to stroke treatment, recovery, and prevention that utilize innovative methods (e.g., adaptive and pragmatic trial designs), and that focuses on the special needs of rural patients. We are particularly interested in trials testing promising therapies to augment recovery after stroke; as such treatments may have a large public health impact.

"A stroke preparedness assessment instrument     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly 800,000 people suffer a stroke each year in the US and the cost of stroke reaches $105 billion annually. Stroke is also a leading cause of disability in the US. Post-stroke disability is dramatically reduced among patients who receive tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). For clinical effectiveness, tPA must be administered within 4.5 hours from the start of stroke symptoms. Unfortunately, tPA is vastly underutilized with about 3% of stroke patients receiving tPA. The majority of patients fail to receive tPA because they arrive to the hospital after the treatment time window has elapsed (this barrier to tPA administration is known as prehospital delay). Researchers have shown that if 911 were called at the time of stroke onset, over 28% of all stroke patients would receive tPA. Therefore, translational research to increase stroke preparedness (defined as the ability to recognize stroke warning signs and call 911 immediately) is urgently needed. However, the field of stroke preparedness is severely limited by the absence of intermediate end points to test behavioral interventions. Before embarking on large scale, expensive, community intervention trials, phase 2 studies using intermediate end points are needed. An intermediate end point allows for testing of several interventions (phase 2 studies) before deciding on the most promising intervention that warrants phase 3 testing. Intermediate end points also facilitate testing interventions for selected populations such as high risk groups like racial/ethnic minorities or those with low socioeconomic status, rather than an entire community. In this project, we will develop and validate a psychometrically rigorous test of stroke preparedness using video vignettes - the video stroke action test (video-STAT). Because of the increased burden of stroke among African Americans, Hispanics and those with low socioeconomic status, we will oversample from these groups in development and validating of the video-STAT. At completion of this study, an innovative stroke preparedness intermediate end point will be created and critical steps toward validating it will be performed. As the US population ages, stroke will only claim more victims and at greater expense to individuals, families and society. It is critical that we rapidly develop rigorous scientific interventions that increase delivery of acute stroke therapy to decrease post-stroke disability and reduce the enormous impact of this devastating disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute stroke treatments dramatically reduce post-stroke disability but are underutilized mostly because stroke patients do not come to the hospital in time. Interventions aiming to increase the number of stroke patients who get to the hospital quickly are limited by faulty outcome measures. This project seeks to develop and validate a video assessment instrument which will allow for rapid testing and targeting of behavioral interventions to increase the use of acute stroke treatments, and ultimately reduce post-stroke disability.            ",A stroke preparedness assessment instrument,8698862,R21NS084081,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Michigan ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Motivation ', ' Neurology ', ' Nurses ', ' Patients ', ' t-PA ', ' Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator ', ' Tissue Plasminogen Activator ', ' Tissue Activator D-44 ', ' T-Plasminogen Activator ', ' Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator ', ' Alteplase ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Simulate ', ' instrument ', ' Hour ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' stroke therapy ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Symptoms ', ' Intervention Community Trial ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Health behavior change ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' phase II study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2014,249168,0.4462555314050177
"Sleep apnea health disparities in Mexican American stroke patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the US and a leading cause of death. Mexican Americans (MA), the largest subgroup of Hispanic Americans, have a substantially higher stroke risk than European Americans, especially at younger ages where the risk is more than double. Given the greater risk and earlier onset, the impact of stroke is disproportionately experienced by MAs. Reasons for increased stroke risk in MAs are poorly understood. More than half of ischemic stroke patients have sleep apnea, a very common and important risk factor for stroke and potentially a risk factor for poor stroke outcome. No published studies have established the prevalence of sleep apnea in MAs to discern sleep apnea's contribution to excess stroke burden in this population. Small studies conducted in academic medical centers have suggested that stroke patients with sleep apnea have particularly poor stroke outcomes, but population-based studies in diverse populations are lacking. The current application seeks to investigate health disparities related to sleep apnea in stroke patients in order to understand the marked ethnic differences in stroke. This research will inform the development of interventions to prevent or treat sleep apnea in MAs, which will reduce the ethnic stroke disparity. The parent study for this project, the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project, is an ongoing population-based stroke surveillance study that identifies stroke cases in Nueces County, Texas. This study has made many important discoveries about stroke in Hispanics. BASIC will continue to identify all strokes in Nueces County until mid year 3 of the current application and will provide detailed 90-day stroke outcome data until mid year 2. The current application will extend BASIC data collection through year 5 month 3 and will add: (1) sleep apnea screening in the acute stroke period that differentiates obstructive from central events, (2) sleep apnea screening for intracerebral hemorrhage cases, (3) access to care measures for sleep apnea, and (4) genetic admixture analysis to investigate how genetics may relate to ethnic disparities in sleep apnea. The application seeks, in a cost-containing fashion, to understand and remedy the influence of a very frequent risk factor, sleep apnea, on a common, devastating disease, stroke, in the largest and fastest growing US minority population.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep apnea is an important predictor of stroke and appears to be a predictor of poor outcomes after stroke. Using the preexisting infrastructure of the BASIC project, the current application will provide an assessment of health disparities related to sleep apnea in stroke patients. It will also allow for the rigorous study of ethnic comparisons of sleep apnea after stroke in European Americans and Hispanics, the largest minority in the United States.

"Caregiving and Health Care Utilization after Stroke among Medicare Beneficiaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States. Women and African Americans commonly have poorer functional outcomes after stroke, although the reasons for these gender and race differences are poorly understood. Some of the differential impact of stroke on women and African Americans might be explained by differential acute treatment and post-acute rehabilitative services, and by differential support of informal family caregivers. These factors have rarely been studied in representative population- based samples of stroke survivors. This application seeks funding to study these factors in a national sample of stroke survivors who are also Medicare beneficiaries. The Caring for Adults Recovering from the Effects of Stroke (CARES) study is an ancillary study of the national REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) project and is the only study of its kind that is systematically collecting long-term functional outcome data from the survivors of verified incident stroke events that are detected in a large-scale, prospective, epidemiologic investigation. Primary family caregivers are also enrolled in the CARES project, and to date, 210 stroke survivor/ family caregiver dyads have been enrolled. Most of these stroke survivors (N = 183, 87%) are traditional Medicare beneficiaires for whom Medicare claims data for the acute hospitalization and post-acute rehabilitative or recovery phase are available. Stroke survivor functional outcomes are assessed during structured in-home evaluations approximately one year after the incident stroke events, and stroke survivor and family caregiver psychosocial functioning and quality of life are assessed with structured telephone interviews beginning 9 months after the incident stroke event and continuing up to 3 years after the stroke event. As part of this proposed extension to the CARES project, we will expand our inclusion criteria to include more stroke survivors, including those without family caregivers, and our total sample size will increase to 420 stroke survivors, including 365 who are also traditional Medicare beneficiaries. While continuing to study outcome disparities among all stroke survivors, new specific aims are advanced in this proposal that focus on measures of health care utilization from the Medicare claims data. Most of the previous studies on care utilization after stroke and the long-term outcomes of stroke have not assessed the influences or experiences of informal family caregivers, and we hypothesize that differences in caregiver availability and involvement will partially explain previously observed gender and race differences in care utilization and functional outcomes. The CARES project is uniquely positioned to link demographic variables, stroke severity measures, post-stroke care utilization patterns, informal caregiving factors, and long-term functional outcomes in ways that will add new knowledge to the literature on why women and African Americans have poorer outcomes after stroke. The project will also advance our general understanding of how stroke affects both patients and their families more broadly.        Stroke is a common medical problem for older adults. Most of the formal rehabilitative care after stroke is covered by traditional Medicare claims, and most stroke patients also receive considerable informal care from close family members. The proposed research will examine the links between informal caregiving support, formal care utilization, and long-term stroke outcomes using a national epidemiologic sample. Caregiving supports during the acute hospitalization and post-acute rehabilitative phases are expected to differ by race and gender, and to partially account for previously observed race and gender differences in outcomes.

"Stroke Incidence and Risk Factors in a Tri-Ethnic Region    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke and cognitive impairment remain a major public health problem with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. The reasons for these race-ethnic disparities are not entirely clear. Improved detection and control of novel stroke risk factors are needed to reduce vascular disease burden. The Northern Manhattan prospective cohort consists of a population-based cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults enrolled since 2001 who have been followed annually for stroke, MI, and death. This collaborative study now involves faculty across 2 academic institutions and is the first prospective cohort study among whites, blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community. Over the last 5 years, the aims have expanded to include subclinical carotid, cardiac, and brain measures. High-resolution carotid imaging data has been assembled on 1770 subjects and a neuropsychological battery and standardized brain MRI will be completed on 1300 subjects with quantitative analyses to measure white matter hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds. This grant supports continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke, MI, and vascular death) and adiponectin, a new marker of obesity, new measures of subclinical carotid disease (carotid plaque area and densitometry), and quantitative MRI measures of vascular subclinical brain disease, as well as evaluate the impact on cognitive decline. To accomplish these aims, stored baseline plasma will be used to measure fasting adiponectin levels. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be quantitatively analyzed from standardized digital recordings. Repeat neuro-psychological testing emphasizing frontal-executive domains will be done on 1105 subjects. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive for any vascular event. Community stroke surveillance will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. The strengths of this cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of traditional and emerging risk factors, and the innovative assessment of MRI subclinical disease and carotid subclinical disease.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and coronary heart disease comprise two of the top three leading causes of death in the US and are of increasing importance in developing countries. While heart disease is the leading cause of death, stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. Stroke continues to have a disproportionate impact on mortality for blacks compared to whites. The aging and rapid growth of the black and Hispanic population has the potential to lead to future increases in the public health impact of stroke and vascular disease. The economic burden in the US due to stroke among Hispanics and blacks from 2005 to 2050 is projected to be $313 billion for Hispanics, and $379 billion for blacks.       Race-ethnic disparities are driven by differences in stroke incidence and vascular risk factors and have remained significant even after accounting for differences in socioeconomic status. Healthy People 2010 called for an elimination of race-ethnic disparities, but did not provide a clear method to achieve this lofty goal.       The principal goals of our study are to help fill the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of stroke and vascular disease particularly among blacks and Hispanics in order to improve future prevention efforts. We have broadened our focus to investigate markers of obesity, subclinical disease measures of the carotid arteries and brain, and predictors of vascular cognitive impairment and decline. We need to understand the importance of these conditions in predicting stroke, MI, vascular death, and determining cognitive decline among minority populations.

"A Community Partnership to Treat Stroke    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans suffer a disproportionate number of strokes resulting in greater post-stroke disability and mortality compared to European Americans. Despite the fact that tissue plasminogen activase (tPA), decreases post-stroke morbidity, mortality and is cost saving, it is underutilized especially among African Americans who are up to one-fifth as likely to receive tPA as European Americans. The primary reason for the underutilization of acute stroke treatments is delayed patient presentation to the hospital which would be remedied by increasing prompt 911 calls for stroke. If all patients presented to the hospital immediately over 25% of stroke patients would receive tPA compared with the 1-3% that are currently treated. The long-term goal of this career development award is to promote the candidate's development into a clinical and research leader in behavioral interventions focusing on health disparities of neurologic disease. The aims of this project are 1)To develop and validate theory-based stroke education intervention materials and outcome measures that use simulated stroke patient video vignettes; 2)To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a faith-based, scientific theory-driven, peer-led behavioral intervention to increase stroke awareness and behavioral intent to call 911 among African American youth and adults in Flint, Michigan. This project is based on a partnership with Bridges into the Future, an African American faith-based community group in Flint, Michigan who will help to design and pre test novel intervention materials and outcome assessments. Then a single group repeated measures design feasibility study will be conducted to obtain preliminary evidence for the impact of our adapted intervention and to test the novel stroke outcome measure. The candidate is committed to a career as a rigorously trained clinician scientist and requires additional training in order to accomplish her long-term goal of reducing health disparities in neurologic disease via behavioral interventions. A detailed career development plan will promote the candidate's development of expertise in the science of behavioral interventions, advanced statistical analysis and an interdisciplinary understanding of health disparities. The career development plan consists of a multidisciplinary team of experts in each of these areas who will oversee a range of formal coursework, working meetings and practical experiences in these areas to ensure the candidate's future success. Excellent resources of a top university and a mentoring team with demonstrated success in developing junior investigators in these topic areas makes the University of Michigan an ideal environment for this project.        Getting to the hospital quickly is the key to treating stroke. African Americans suffer more strokes with worse outcomes and receive stroke treatments less often than European Americans. This project will work to reduce these health disparities by creating and testing the feasibility of a peer-led faith-based behavioral intervention in an African American community with a goal to increase calls to 911 so stroke patients can be treated quickly.

"Regional & Racial Differences in Hemostasis & Risk of Stroke & Heart Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a 5-year research and training program for Dr. Neil A. Zakai (a junior faculty member at the University of Vermont) to develop an independent career in vascular epidemiology by investigating the impact hemostatic biomarker levels have on regional and racial differences in stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) in the 30,228 black and white individuals in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study (REGARDS).  Dr. Mary Cushman, an internationally recognized investigator in cardiovascular epidemiology, will serve as the principle mentor for this project. Though the period of this study, Dr. Cushman will support the educational and research aspects of this project. The advisory committee was selected from experts in epidemiology, neurology, and hematology to provide the best opportunities for networking and future collaborations. Dr. Zakai will meet with the advisory committee both in person and through teleconferences on a monthly basis. To achieve a future independent research career for Dr. Zakai, we propose specific coursework in epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Vermont and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  The project will be a case-cohort study focusing on the impact of multiple hemostatic biomarkers (both individually and in groups) on the regional and racial differences in stroke and CHD incidence in the United States. The specific aims will 1) create the nested case-cohort study within REGARDS, 2) use multivariable modeling and factor analysis to elucidate mechanisms for stroke and CHD and 3) integrate hemostatic biomarkers and traditional CVD risk factors into a model for stroke and CHD risk that can account for racial and/or regional differences in CVD.  The Laboratory for Clinical and Biochemical Research at the University of Vermont serves as an ideal setting to conduct this research by bringing together the laboratory aspects and the epidemiological expertise to ensure a rich translational research experience.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are regional and racial differences in coronary heart disease and stroke not explained by conventional cardiovascular risk factors.

"Outcomes Among Surrogate decision makers In Stroke (OASIS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every day in hospitals across the country, patients with severe stroke and their families are faced with decisions about life-sustaining treatments in the initial hours of admission. These decisions about resuscitation status, invasive treatments, or possible transitions to comfort care are typically made by a surrogate decision- maker due to communication or cognitive deficits in the patient. This surrogate must consider the patient's life goals and values to determine if their loved one would choose on-going intensive treatments where they may survive and yet have long term disabilities, or prioritize comfort and accept the likelihood of an earlier death. Serving as a surrogate decision maker for a patient in the intensive care unit can have long lasting negative consequences. However, almost nothing is known about surrogate decision makers in diverse populations with stroke. Hispanic Americans are now the largest minority group in the US, rapidly growing and aging, with Mexican Americans comprising the largest subgroup. Multiple disparities have been identified in stroke incidence and outcome between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites, particularly in the use of life- sustaining treatments. Minority populations may be particularly vulnerable to inadequate communication about end-of-life issues due to socioeconomic disadvantage, poor health literacy, and lack of provider empathy and health system strategies to improve communication. However, Mexican American culture includes strong values of family support and religiosity that may have a positive influence on discussions about life-sustaining treatment and adapting to stroke-related disabilities. There is currently a critical gap in understanding the perspectives and outcomes of stroke surrogate decision makers, making it impossible to design interventions to help diverse populations of patients and families through this incredibly trying time. The aims of this proposal are 1) To assess physician quality of communication, shared decision-making, and quality of end-of-life care among stroke surrogate decision makers; and 2) To assess the long-term impact of serving as a surrogate decision maker for stroke and assess the unmet decision support needs of stroke surrogates. Results will be used to design future targeted decision support interventions for diverse populations of stroke patients and family members. This proposal takes advantage of the extensive established infrastructure of the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS038916), a population based epidemiological stroke surveillance study recently funded for its fourth 5-year cycle. New prospectively obtained data on surrogate decision-maker outcomes using established validated measures will be linked to BASIC's rich longitudinal patient-level data on functional outcome to maximize efficiency. Leveraging the resources of this highly successful project will allow a comprehensive yet cost-effective investigation that would not otherwise be feasible to study in a prospective longitudinal cohort design.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently, very little is known about the experience and outcomes of family members who make medical decisions for individuals with stroke. Results from this project will improve our understanding of the early and long-range consequences of these challenging decisions in diverse populations and help to develop specific interventions to reduce the emotional and psychological burden on family members.            ",Outcomes Among Surrogate decision makers In Stroke (OASIS),9028490,R01NS091112,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Aging ', ' Anxiety ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Empathy ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physicians ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Regrets ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Family member ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Country ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Emotional ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Health system ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health literacy ', ' attributable death ', ' attributable mortality ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' loved ones ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' surveillance study ', ' quality of dying ', ' quality of death ', ' shared decision making ', ' surrogate decision maker ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,430018,0.26608912840488264
"Reducing Racial Disparities in Post-Stroke Disability in the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is common, nearly 800,000 strokes occur annually, and a leading cause of disability in the U.S. Non-Hispanic Black/African American (Black) adults have the highest stroke prevalence and suffer the most post-stroke disability of any U.S. racial/ethnic group. Even though racial disparities in post-stroke disability are widespread, little it is known about how to reduce this disparity. Racial differences in disability arise in the post-stroke period; however it is unclear if these differences arise shortly after strke in the early recovery period, when many stroke survivors are undergoing rehabilitation, or after stroke survivors return to the community. This project will address the critical questions of when racial disparities in post-stroke disability arise and determine the drivers of this disparity in ech period. Answering these questions is an essential step to designing interventions to improve health in Black stroke survivors and reduce disparities. To address these questions, we will rely on the newly available National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) linked to Medicare claims and functional assessment data. NHATS is a national, longitudinal survey of Medicare beneficiaries focused on understanding the causes and consequences of disability in the elderly. NHATS performs annual face-to-face interviews to carefully characterize disability in the elderly and measures a vast array of disability predictors including social, community and disability accommodation factors. Additionally NHATS's linkage to Medicare claims will enable measurement of important medical and rehabilitation factors that may also explain racial differences in post-stroke disability. These data sources will be used to develop the first comprehensive measures of rehabilitation intensity across all rehabilitation settings-home health, outpatient, skilled nursing and inpatient rehabilitation-compare intensity by race and estimate the effect of rehabilitation intensity on disability disparities. At the completion of the study, the timing and drivers of race differences in post-stroke disability will be identified. Furthermore, our novel measures of rehabilitation intensity can serve as a prototype for use in studying the role of rehabilitation in other diseases such as traumatic brain injury and arthritis. This proposal is particularly responsive to the NIMHD solicitation in that it focuses on modifiable drivers of racial differences in post-stroke disability from a policy standpoint and will directly inform stroke survivor and family level strategies to reduce disability and decrease disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-Hispanic Black/African American (Black) adults have more strokes and experience greater disability after their strokes than non-Hispanic White adults. Using newly available data, this project will determine the time when racial differences in post-stroke disability arise and the factors that lead to racial differences in post- stroke disabiity. These results will be directly used to develop strategies and interventions to improve the health of Black stroke survivors and reduce disparities.",Reducing Racial Disparities in Post-Stroke Disability in the Elderly,8885885,R01MD008879,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Arthritis ', ' Attention ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Home Health Agency ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Extended Care Facilities ', ' Skilled Nursing Facilities ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Life ', ' social rehab ', ' social rehabilitation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic encephalopathy ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' trend ', ' Modification ', ' beneficiary ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' community living ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' Medicare claim ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,387500,0.22415093848868395
"Hispanic Stroke Prevention Intervention Research Program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanics are the largest minority group and by 2050 will be constitute 30% of the US population. Although Mexican Americans are the largest subgroup, Caribbean Hispanics are the second largest subgroup in the U.S. The aging and rapid growth of the Hispanic population will lead to increases in the impact of stroke. Innovative strategies are needed to reduce stroke risk and eliminate disparities among Hispanics. Our Hispanic Stroke Prevention Intervention Research Program is a collaborative application from the University of Miami and the University of Puerto Rico aimed at reducing stroke disparities in the Hispanic community. The central theme of our program is risk factor control among Hispanics at risk of stroke. In project I, we will assess in a randomized trial the effectiveness o an innovative secondary stroke prevention intervention program to improve the control of risk factors, uses a health care delivery model that has been successful for chronic disease management in minority communities, integrates pharmacists in the enhancement of adherence, and state of the art mobile information technology. In project II, we will systematically evaluate the determinants of blood pressure variability and glucose control among high-risk Hispanic family members of stroke patients. We will assess novel psychosocial, sociocultural, healthcare system, and biological variables as part of a conceptual model that incorporates psychosocial adversities, reserve capacity, and cumulative vulnerabilities as determinants of 24hour blood pressure variability. In project III we will create the Florida Puerto Rico Stroke Registry by collating data from 140 hospitals that are currently collecting Get With the Guidelines-Stroke data to help identify stroke disparities by race, ethnicity, and region and educate stakeholders in approaches to improve stroke quality regarding stroke disparities. Our program includes three cores: administrative core, the research/education training core, and the data management and statistics core. Our multidisciplinary program unites investigators across two minority-serving institutions, addresses significant gaps in our knowledge of stroke risk in Hispanics, and will provide results that can have an immediate impact on future primary and secondary stroke prevention efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This specialized collaborative program will address stroke disparities in the Hispanic population. The projects have been designed to develop culturally-tailored approaches to secondary and primary stroke prevention, as well as identify and reduce acute stroke disparities.

"The University of Iowa's Statewide Stroke Research Network DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of lowa (Ul) Statewide Stroke Research Network meets the goal of the NINDS Stroke Trials Network of maximizing efficiencies in developing, promoting, and conducting high quality multi-site clinical trials on stroke prevention, treatment, and recovery. The current proposal builds on the rich tradition of the Ul as a leader in both developing and conducting NINDS-sponsored research, as well as on the Ul's role as the hub of a new integrated health care network - The Ul Health Alliance. The long-term goals of this proposal are to improve the efficiency of conducting Phase I - III stroke trials and to ensure a robust pipeline of well-trained clinical investigators to lead such trials. he proposal's immediate goal is to establish an expanded statewide research network for conducting stroke trials that reaches underserved rural patients who currently are unable to participate in stroke trials due to geographical barriers and who are subject to disparities in health outcomes. The proposed University of lowa Regional Coordinating Center (UIRCC) represents a comprehensive and integrated infrastructure for conducting trials that brings together healthcare providers, hospital administrators, clinical and health service investigators, public health officials, and patient advocates. The UIRCC comprises a network that expands the research capabilities of the Ul to 12 trial-ready sites. Those hospitals will be supplied by a statewide infrastructure of spokes that will allow adequate representation in trials of those Americans first evaluated at critical access hospitals. The UIRCC will capitalize on prior work by the PI to improve recruitment of patients presenting to critical access hospitals and maximize geographic access of patients. The feasibility of this approach is supported by the ongoing research data sharing collaboration, and a strong institutional support from the statewide healthcare alliance. We have plans already in place to expand this statewide network model to Nebraska and to the Dakotas. The UIRCC will also develop innovative translational research proposals that will lead to multicenter clinical trials through the NINDS stroke network by bringing together clinicians, early stage (i.e., bench to bedside) translational investigators, clinical trialists, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and geographers to develop proposals of new approaches to stroke treatment, recovery, and prevention that utilize innovative methods (e.g., adaptive and pragmatic trial designs), and that focuses on the special needs of rural patients. We are particularly interested in trials testing promising therapies to augment recovery after stroke; as such treatments may have a large public health impact.

"A Community Partnership to Treat Stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans suffer a disproportionate number of strokes resulting in greater post-stroke disability and mortality compared to European Americans. Despite the fact that tissue plasminogen activase (tPA), decreases post-stroke morbidity, mortality and is cost saving, it is underutilized especially among African Americans who are up to one-fifth as likely to receive tPA as European Americans. The primary reason for the underutilization of acute stroke treatments is delayed patient presentation to the hospital which would be remedied by increasing prompt 911 calls for stroke. If all patients presented to the hospital immediately over 25% of stroke patients would receive tPA compared with the 1-3% that are currently treated. The long-term goal of this career development award is to promote the candidate's development into a clinical and research leader in behavioral interventions focusing on health disparities of neurologic disease. The aims of this project are 1)To develop and validate theory-based stroke education intervention materials and outcome measures that use simulated stroke patient video vignettes; 2)To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a faith-based, scientific theory-driven, peer-led behavioral intervention to increase stroke awareness and behavioral intent to call 911 among African American youth and adults in Flint, Michigan. This project is based on a partnership with Bridges into the Future, an African American faith-based community group in Flint, Michigan who will help to design and pre test novel intervention materials and outcome assessments. Then a single group repeated measures design feasibility study will be conducted to obtain preliminary evidence for the impact of our adapted intervention and to test the novel stroke outcome measure. The candidate is committed to a career as a rigorously trained clinician scientist and requires additional training in order to accomplish her long-term goal of reducing health disparities in neurologic disease via behavioral interventions. A detailed career development plan will promote the candidate's development of expertise in the science of behavioral interventions, advanced statistical analysis and an interdisciplinary understanding of health disparities. The career development plan consists of a multidisciplinary team of experts in each of these areas who will oversee a range of formal coursework, working meetings and practical experiences in these areas to ensure the candidate's future success. Excellent resources of a top university and a mentoring team with demonstrated success in developing junior investigators in these topic areas makes the University of Michigan an ideal environment for this project. Getting to the hospital quickly is the key to treating stroke. African Americans suffer more strokes with worse outcomes and receive stroke treatments less often than European Americans. This project will work to reduce these health disparities by creating and testing the feasibility of a peer-led faith-based behavioral intervention in an African American community with a goal to increase calls to 911 so stroke patients can be treated quickly.",A Community Partnership to Treat Stroke,8896073,K23NS073685,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Awareness ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Mentors ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Profibrinolysin ', ' EC 3.4.21.7 ', ' Plasminogen ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Outcomes Assessment ', ' Outcome Assessment (Health Care) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' European ', ' satisfaction ', ' Development Plans ', ' Sample Size ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Activase ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' stroke therapy ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Symptoms ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' stroke education ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based participatory research ', ' loved ones ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' faith-based intervention ', ' 911 call ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2015,187380,0.39985285295205086
"PeRiodontal treatment to Eliminate Minority InEquality and Rural disparities in Stroke (PREMIERS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death and the leading cause of long-term adult disability in the United States. Stroke remains more common in North and South Carolina, part of the ""buckle"" of the stroke belt, and disproportionately impacts African Americans. The reasons for this racial disparity are poorly understood and are not entirely explained by traditional stroke risk factors. The REGARDS study found that tooth loss (a surrogate of periodontal disease) was more common among African Americans than whites and was associated with higher stroke risk and stroke risk factors. Given this result, REGARDS investigators postulated that periodontal disease may be contributing to the racial disparity in stroke. Additional data from this study shows that low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with greater tooth loss, both of which are seen more frequently in African Americans as opposed to their white counterparts. Considering these factors, a question arises about whether low SES, race, a combination of the two, and/or traditional risk factors contribute to tooth loss, periodontl disease, and recurrent vascular events. Howard and colleagues suggest in their paper that race is the predominant factor contributing to vascular events after adjustment for SES and risk factors. If the predisposition exists among African Americans for greater periodontal disease and incident vascular events, then what modifications can clinicians make to prevent recurrent vascular events in this population? The PREMIERS study is a application for conducting an adequately powered two-center Phase III randomized controlled trial to test whether intensive periodontal treatment reduces the risk of recurrent vascular events among ischemic stroke and TIA survivors. The study uses the resources in both states including established dental centers, Joint Commission Certified Stroke Centers, the Schools of Public Health, and the Institute for Partnerships to Eliminate Health Disparities. The application addresses specific issues with regards to recruitment of African-American and rural stroke/TIA patients advocating the use of culturally appropriate strategies to educate the study subjects regarding stroke, periodontal disease and the periodontal stroke link. The study proposes to utilize economic evaluation of the periodontal intervention from the budgetary perspective. The focus will be on the financial sustainability of providing aggressive periodontal therapy (with certain, although relatively low expenditures) in exchange for a reduction of uncertain recurrent vascular events that may require high cost emergency department utilization and/or inpatient care. The sustainability of the proposed intervention after the completion of the project is integrally linked to the health economic assessment to show the health care cost savings. By integration with a rural primary care center, with an African American majority and households with average incomes below the state average, the study ensures that the proposed intervention to reduce stroke disparity is applicable to this target population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and periodontal disease are prevalent among African Americans residing in North Carolina and South Carolina, states recognized as the ""buckle"" of the stroke belt.

"Hispanic Stroke Prevention Intervention Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanics are the largest minority group and by 2050 will be constitute 30% of the US population. Although Mexican Americans are the largest subgroup, Caribbean Hispanics are the second largest subgroup in the U.S. The aging and rapid growth of the Hispanic population will lead to increases in the impact of stroke. Innovative strategies are needed to reduce stroke risk and eliminate disparities among Hispanics. Our Hispanic Stroke Prevention Intervention Research Program is a collaborative application from the University of Miami and the University of Puerto Rico aimed at reducing stroke disparities in the Hispanic community. The central theme of our program is risk factor control among Hispanics at risk of stroke. In project I, we will assess in a randomized trial the effectiveness o an innovative secondary stroke prevention intervention program to improve the control of risk factors, uses a health care delivery model that has been successful for chronic disease management in minority communities, integrates pharmacists in the enhancement of adherence, and state of the art mobile information technology. In project II, we will systematically evaluate the determinants of blood pressure variability and glucose control among high-risk Hispanic family members of stroke patients. We will assess novel psychosocial, sociocultural, healthcare system, and biological variables as part of a conceptual model that incorporates psychosocial adversities, reserve capacity, and cumulative vulnerabilities as determinants of 24hour blood pressure variability. In project III we will create the Florida Puerto Rico Stroke Registry by collating data from 140 hospitals that are currently collecting Get With the Guidelines-Stroke data to help identify stroke disparities by race, ethnicity, and region and educate stakeholders in approaches to improve stroke quality regarding stroke disparities. Our program includes three cores: administrative core, the research/education training core, and the data management and statistics core. Our multidisciplinary program unites investigators across two minority-serving institutions, addresses significant gaps in our knowledge of stroke risk in Hispanics, and will provide results that can have an immediate impact on future primary and secondary stroke prevention efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This specialized collaborative program will address stroke disparities in the Hispanic population. The projects have been designed to develop culturally-tailored approaches to secondary and primary stroke prevention, as well as identify and reduce acute stroke disparities.

"Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to continue our population-based study of stroke incidence and case fatality, prevalence of risk factors, stroke treatment, and post-stroke outcomes within a biracial metropolitan population of 1,368,604 of whom 223,417 (16.3%) are of black race (US Census 2010). The proposed work will involve an anticipated ~3,750 patients with 4,250 strokes and/or transient ischemic attacks from our region in 2014/2015, an estimated ~600 recurrent strokes from 2015-2018 (following all strokes and transient ischemic attacks for 3 years after the original 2014/2015 event), as well as 2,000 survey participants.  For almost 20 years, we have studied trends in stroke incidence and case fatality and have demonstrated a racial disparity where stroke incidence in African-Americans is more than double that of whites. In each prior study period, we have also examined the prevalence of risk factors (and knowledge of stroke) via a population survey in order to put our temporal trend findings into context.  In addition to continuing these important activities, we seek to examine stroke recurrence in a population- based fashion (which has not been done since the 1990's) with the goal of identifying whether there is a racial disparity in stroke recurrence. We propose an innovative pilot study to determine if we can estimate functional outcome and place of residence at 3- and 6-months post-stroke without patient contact, using a local health- information exchange (HIE) and electronic health record. We will compare our estimate to phone interviews with the subject as the ""gold standard""; the phone interview to be used was successfully piloted in the current period. Finally, we have used our data to inform eligibility for stroke clinical trils. We propose to share our data with the scientific community for this purpose. In our proposed work, we will have data regarding acute stroke presentation and will add information about stroke recurrence and post-stroke functional outcomes that can be used for rational planning of stroke interventions in all phases of stroke (acute, secondary prevention, recovery).  In all of th proposed activities, the use of the HIE will make the proposed work possible (harnessing the power of centralized health data) and will be important for accomplishing the work efficiently. Overall, our proposed study will accomplish more than prior periods in a shorter time and without increased cost.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The change in stroke occurrence and recurrence over time is the ultimate test of how well science has translated new discoveries into benefits for the population. Our study has examined racial disparities in stroke over the last 20 years, showing that blacks have higher risk for stroke than whites. In our population, the occurrence of stroke is decreasing in whites but NOT African-Americans, and we will continue to describe trends in stroke occurrence, recurrence, cause, treatment, and outcome in a biracial metropolitan population.              ",Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites,8895029,R01NS030678,"['Age ', ' Black race ', ' Censuses ', ' Brain TIA ', ' Transient Ischemic Attack ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Kentucky ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Destinations ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' residence ', ' Recovery ', ' Collaborations ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' Medical center ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Data ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' stroke recovery ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' Secure ', ' screening ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R01,2015,2206161,0.48278824196710807
"The Discovering Healthcare Innovations to Address Disparties in Stroke (DIADS) pr     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans experience the highest rates of stroke of all race/ethnic groups In the US. Stroke in African American occurs at younger ages than Caucasians. While racial disparities in stroke exist at all ages, disparities are greatest in young adulthood. Temporal trend data suggest that these stroke disparities in young adulthood may be widening. Hypertension is the most common and potent risk factor for stroke in the US. Blood pressure (BP) control rates are known to differ by race and may be an important contributor to racial disparities in stroke. Disparities in blood pressure control are most prominent in younger adulthood, further contributing to disparities in stroke rates in this age group. Efforts aimed at the primary prevention of stroke have generally not focused on young adulthood, despite the greatest disparities in incident disease being observed in this period and the opportunity for long-term risk reduction via interventions targeted early in adulthood. Effective intervention targeting known stroke risk factors (e.g. hypertension) have not been developed for young adults. Additionally the literature on novel risk factors present in young adulthood that may be amenable to additional risk reduction is currently lacking. DIADS is collaboration between Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). DIADS seeks to design, implement, and evaluate a clinically-delivered hypertension control intervention that consists of both a clinical algorithm for rapid an effective blood BP control, as well as a culturally-tailored dietary Intervention aimed at more effective sustained BP control. Specific Aim 1: To conduct a cluster pragmatic randomized trial of a clinically-delivered hypertension control intervention (Shake, Rattle, and Roll) that will consist of a clinical algorithm for rapid and sustained blood pressure control, as well as a culturally tailored dietary intervention. Specific Aim 2: To conduct an observational cohort study of children, adolescents, and young adults within KPNC to identify temporal trends in traditional risk factors for stroke in the young, as well as novel factors that may Increase stroke risk in thi age group. Specific Aim 3: To implement the essential components of the Shake, Rattle, and Roll hypertension control intervention in a local community clinic serving a diverse population and then disseminate the intervention among a broad coalition of community clinics in Alameda County and San Francisco County.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood pressure control rates are known to differ by race and are likely be an important contributor to racial disparities in stroke, particularly for young Afrian American adults in whom a disturbing increase in stroke rates has occurred in recent years. The DIADS program will provide information that is likely to result in better understanding of stroke etiology in the young and a hypertension (HTN) treatment program that can reduce HTN control disparities and be disseminated widely, resulting in reduction of stroke disparities.            ",The Discovering Healthcare Innovations to Address Disparties in Stroke (DIADS) pr,8914686,U54NS081760,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' County ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' systolic hypertension ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' cardiovascular epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' experience ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP control ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' novel ', ' treatment program ', ' Population Study ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' nutritional epidemiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Training ', ' Public Health Instruction ', ' Public Health Education ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' trend ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' hypertension treatment ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' minority trainee ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' hypertension control ', ' randomized trial ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' ']",NINDS,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U54,2015,1976099,0.33445287211464764
"Impact of disordered mineral metabolism on stroke and cognitive impairment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke and cognitive impairment are major causes of death and disability in the US and disproportionately impact blacks. While traditional stroke risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes contribute to racial disparities in cerebrovascular outcomes, they are not sufficient to completely explain these findings, suggesting that non-traditional risk factors play an important role. Disturbances in vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism have emerged as non-traditional risk factors for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels are associated with heart disease and death via broad effects on inflammation, insulin resistance and blood pressure control. Disturbances in phosphorus metabolism stimulate the secretion of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a bone-derived hormone that maintains phosphorus homeostasis in part by inhibiting the conversion of 25D to its activated metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). Our group and others showed that higher FGF23 levels were associated with adverse outcomes through direct and indirect effects promoting cardiovascular disease and 1,25D deficiency. Moreover, preliminary data from our group suggest that low vitamin D is an independent risk factor for stroke and cognitive impairment. The primary focus of the current proposal is to build upon this prior work by determining whether low plasma 25D levels and excess plasma FGF23 levels are associated with incident stroke and cognitive impairment in a large, national cohort (Aim 1). In addition, since disorders of vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism are more common and severe in blacks than whites, we will determine if they partly underlie racial disparities in stroke (Aim 2). Finally, given that inflammation, insulin resistance and hypertension are key risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, and are interconnected with disturbances in vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism, we will determine whether they partly mediate the associations of 25D and FGF23 with stroke and cognitive decline. We will test these hypotheses by measuring plasma 25D, FGF23 and other key mediators of mineral metabolism including 1,25D, parathyroid hormone, calcium and phosphate in stored blood samples from a specified case cohort of 2,085 participants of the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, a national prospective study of black and white adults designed to identify novel risk factors for racial disparities in stroke. The case-cohort to be used for this study has available measures of inflammation and insulin resistance, making it uniquely well-suited to test our hypotheses. The results of these studies may have an important impact on the treatment and/or prevention of stroke and cognitive decline. Indeed, 25D deficiency and FGF23 excess are common in the general population, disproportionately impact blacks, and can be treated with safe and relatively inexpensive therapies. Thus, if vitamin D deficiency and excess FGF23 are risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, this would support intervention trials testing the treatment of these disorders in reducing rates of incident stroke and cognitive impairment, particularly among black individuals. Disorders of vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism are strongly linked to cardiovascular disease. The studies proposed herein will clarify the role of vitamin D deficiency and excess levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 in stroke, cognitive impairment, and racial disparities in these outcomes. Since vitamin D deficiency and elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 levels are common and disproportionately impact blacks, these studies may uncover novel therapeutic strategies for improving cerebrovascular outcomes in the general population, particularly among African Americans.",Impact of disordered mineral metabolism on stroke and cognitive impairment,8882567,R01NS080850,"['Metabolic

"Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Stroke has the largest racial disparity of any chronic disease, Geographic disparities also exist, and the magnitude of both disparities is increasing. Alarmingly, REGARDS has documented racial and geographic disparities in cognitive decline that are of the same magnitude as for stroke. A lack of understanding of the causes of these disparities has contributed directly to the failure to reduce or eliminate them.  REGARDS is a national cohort of 30,239 black and white community-dwelling participants aged 45+ when enrolled in 2003-2007. We propose to utilize the cohort to build on findings to date and extend our findings to evaluate new hypotheses. REGARDS is positioned to document disparities in incidence of stroke and cognitive impairment and also to understand why these disparities exist.  We propose to conduct a second in-person evaluation to define incidence and progression of stroke risk factors. We will continue stroke ascertainment to double the number of stroke events and improve our ability to define factors contributing to the as yet ""unexplained"" stroke disparities. By continuing cognitive assessments, and adding more sensitive in-person measures of cognitive function, and instrumental activities of daily living, we will advance the understanding of causes and clinical relevance of disparities in cognitive decline. We propose the following specific aims:  ¿ Specific Aim #1: to quantify incidence of, and change in severity of stroke risk factors over  9 years of follow-up, and to establish causes for racial and geographic disparities in these  risk factors.  ¿ Specific Aim #2: to evaluate three pathways that may account for ""unexplained"" disparities:  a) differential impact of risk factors where the same change in risk factor increases risk  more for one race than the other, b) residual confounding from incomplete characterization  of risk factors, and c) ""novel"" stroke risk factors including psychosocial and behavioral  factors.  ¿ Specific Aim #3: Measure the functional impact of cognitive impairment, estimate the  prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment over 10 years of follow-up, and account  for racial disparities in cognition attributable to literacy by gathering new information on  functional performance and word reading ability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Estimates suggest that the racial and geographic disparities in stroke are associated with over 20,000 ""extra"" stroke events annually, with an estimated cost per stroke of $140,000; hence, the public health burden of these disparities is in excess of $6 billion dollars annually. If this research provides insights that would contribute to a 10% reduction in the magnitude of these disparities, the entire 5-year cost of this application would be recouped in savings in less than 16 days (a savings that would reoccur each 16 days). Our previous work in REGARDS has documented similar racial and geographic disparities in cognitive function, and these disparities in cognitive function will have similar public health ramifications with the ""graying of America.""",Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke,8789180,U01NS041588,"['Accounting ', ' Americas ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' literacy ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' Paper ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Evaluation ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' insight ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' Gray ', ' Gray unit of radiation dose ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' reading proficiency ', ' reading competence ', ' reading achievement ', ' reading ability ', ' cognitive performance ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2015,6232353,0.30486787163094886
"Caregiving and Health Care Utilization after Stroke among Medicare Beneficiaries DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States. Women and African Americans commonly have poorer functional outcomes after stroke, although the reasons for these gender and race differences are poorly understood. Some of the differential impact of stroke on women and African Americans might be explained by differential acute treatment and post-acute rehabilitative services, and by differential support of informal family caregivers. These factors have rarely been studied in representative population- based samples of stroke survivors. This application seeks funding to study these factors in a national sample of stroke survivors who are also Medicare beneficiaries. The Caring for Adults Recovering from the Effects of Stroke (CARES) study is an ancillary study of the national REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) project and is the only study of its kind that is systematically collecting long-term functional outcome data from the survivors of verified incident stroke events that are detected in a large-scale, prospective, epidemiologic investigation. Primary family caregivers are also enrolled in the CARES project, and to date, 210 stroke survivor/ family caregiver dyads have been enrolled. Most of these stroke survivors (N = 183, 87%) are traditional Medicare beneficiaires for whom Medicare claims data for the acute hospitalization and post-acute rehabilitative or recovery phase are available. Stroke survivor functional outcomes are assessed during structured in-home evaluations approximately one year after the incident stroke events, and stroke survivor and family caregiver psychosocial functioning and quality of life are assessed with structured telephone interviews beginning 9 months after the incident stroke event and continuing up to 3 years after the stroke event. As part of this proposed extension to the CARES project, we will expand our inclusion criteria to include more stroke survivors, including those without family caregivers, and our total sample size will increase to 420 stroke survivors, including 365 who are also traditional Medicare beneficiaries. While continuing to study outcome disparities among all stroke survivors, new specific aims are advanced in this proposal that focus on measures of health care utilization from the Medicare claims data. Most of the previous studies on care utilization after stroke and the long-term outcomes of stroke have not assessed the influences or experiences of informal family caregivers, and we hypothesize that differences in caregiver availability and involvement will partially explain previously observed gender and race differences in care utilization and functional outcomes. The CARES project is uniquely positioned to link demographic variables, stroke severity measures, post-stroke care utilization patterns, informal caregiving factors, and long-term functional outcomes in ways that will add new knowledge to the literature on why women and African Americans have poorer outcomes after stroke. The project will also advance our general understanding of how stroke affects both patients and their families more broadly. Stroke is a common medical problem for older adults. Most of the formal rehabilitative care after stroke is covered by traditional Medicare claims, and most stroke patients also receive considerable informal care from close family members. The proposed research will examine the links between informal caregiving support, formal care utilization, and long-term stroke outcomes using a national epidemiologic sample. Caregiving supports during the acute hospitalization and post-acute rehabilitative phases are expected to differ by race and gender, and to partially account for previously observed race and gender differences in outcomes.",Caregiving and Health Care Utilization after Stroke among Medicare Beneficiaries,8866482,R01NS075047,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Enabling Factors ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Literature ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Population Decreases ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family member ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Symptoms ', ' Psychosocial Effect ', ' Treatment/Psychosocial Effects ', ' Data ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' cost ', ' adjudicate ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' service utilization ', ' Medicare claim ', ' population based ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' ']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,392817,0.40172977281875055
"Sleep apnea health disparities in Mexican American stroke patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the US and a leading cause of death. Mexican Americans (MA), the largest subgroup of Hispanic Americans, have a substantially higher stroke risk than European Americans, especially at younger ages where the risk is more than double. Given the greater risk and earlier onset, the impact of stroke is disproportionately experienced by MAs. Reasons for increased stroke risk in MAs are poorly understood. More than half of ischemic stroke patients have sleep apnea, a very common and important risk factor for stroke and potentially a risk factor for poor stroke outcome. No published studies have established the prevalence of sleep apnea in MAs to discern sleep apnea's contribution to excess stroke burden in this population. Small studies conducted in academic medical centers have suggested that stroke patients with sleep apnea have particularly poor stroke outcomes, but population-based studies in diverse populations are lacking. The current application seeks to investigate health disparities related to sleep apnea in stroke patients in order to understand the marked ethnic differences in stroke. This research will inform the development of interventions to prevent or treat sleep apnea in MAs, which will reduce the ethnic stroke disparity. The parent study for this project, the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project, is an ongoing population-based stroke surveillance study that identifies stroke cases in Nueces County, Texas. This study has made many important discoveries about stroke in Hispanics. BASIC will continue to identify all strokes in Nueces County until mid year 3 of the current application and will provide detailed 90-day stroke outcome data until mid year 2. The current application will extend BASIC data collection through year 5 month 3 and will add: (1) sleep apnea screening in the acute stroke period that differentiates obstructive from central events, (2) sleep apnea screening for intracerebral hemorrhage cases, (3) access to care measures for sleep apnea, and (4) genetic admixture analysis to investigate how genetics may relate to ethnic disparities in sleep apnea. The application seeks, in a cost-containing fashion, to understand and remedy the influence of a very frequent risk factor, sleep apnea, on a common, devastating disease, stroke, in the largest and fastest growing US minority population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep apnea is an important predictor of stroke and appears to be a predictor of poor outcomes after stroke. Using the preexisting infrastructure of the BASIC project, the current application will provide an assessment of health disparities related to sleep apnea in stroke patients. It will also allow for the rigorous study of ethnic comparisons of sleep apnea after stroke in European Americans and Hispanics, the largest minority in the United States.",Sleep apnea health disparities in Mexican American stroke patients,8836598,R01NS070941,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' Data Collection ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep-Disordered Breathing ', ' Sleep Hypopnea ', ' Sleep Apnea ', ' Sleep Apnea Syndromes ', ' Smoking ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' European ', ' Genetic ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' ethnic difference ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Preparation ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' early onset ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' surveillance study ', ' screening ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,619580,0.36338861705193226
"Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mexican Americans are the most numerous sub-group of Hispanic Americans, the largest minority population in the United States. This important group is aging and growing rapidly. For the past 14 years the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project has provided rich original stroke disparities research comparing Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. BASIC remains the only means to monitor stroke trends and to investigate stroke outcomes in Mexican Americans. BASIC has demonstrated that stroke incidence is higher in Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites. New stroke incidence data from BASIC show that the disparity remains completely unabated over the last decade. Further, stroke onset occurs at younger ages in Mexican Americans providing more years of disability. This contributes to a substantial increased cost for stroke in Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites. Remarkable new data from BASIC suggests that the previously seen Mexican American survival advantage post-stroke is disappearing. Further, Mexican American stroke survivors have worse neurologic and functional outcomes. Thus, BASIC data suggests that in 2013 Mexican Americans have more strokes, occurring at younger ages, and experience far greater post- stroke disability than non-Hispanic whites. The current proposal seeks to continue to provide rigorous stroke surveillance to monitor stroke trends in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We further propose to provide new longer-term (six month and one year) stroke outcome data to provide crucial information on the time course and changes in neurologic, functional, cognitive, and quality of life outcomes post-stroke in both ethnic groups. Additionally, since post-stroke disability appears much worse in Mexican Americans, we plan to delve deeply into the structure of informal caregiving post-stroke and understand the needs of stroke survivors and the role of families in addressing these needs. This data on the social/family context in which stroke survivors function will be crucial for designing intervention to improve stroke outcome. Finally, the definition of stroke will be studied to understand the impact on measures of stroke burden derived from an ethnically diverse population-based study. BASIC has published over 55 original, peer-reviewed manuscripts, spun-off 5 R-level grants and served as the foundation for training numerous diverse students. In this next cycle, we are poised and deeply committed to provide a fundamental understanding of long-term stroke trends, outcome studies, and informal caregiving structure, as well as continuing to provide key clinical observations such as the impact of the new stroke definition. This work is absolutely critical to Mexican Americans, a growing, aging and large minority population that will increasingly feel the impact from stroke in the next decade. Indeed, this work is also critical to clinicians and public health planners as BASIC continues to offer key observations on stroke and Mexican American health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to monitor and understand the tremendous stroke disparity among Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Stroke incidence, recurrence, mortality, and, in survivors, neurologic, functional and cognitive outcomes will be compared among the ethnic groups. Informal caregiving structure will be studied to improve services and tailor interventions for stroke survivors and families to improve stroke outcome and prevent second stroke.",Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project,8816142,R01NS038916,"['Age ', ' Aging ', ' American Heart Association ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Incidence ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Survivors ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' ethnic difference ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' stroke recovery ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' population based ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,766337,0.35564741078733175
"A stroke preparedness assessment instrument DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly 800,000 people suffer a stroke each year in the US and the cost of stroke reaches $105 billion annually. Stroke is also a leading cause of disability in the US. Post-stroke disability is dramatically reduced among patients who receive tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). For clinical effectiveness, tPA must be administered within 4.5 hours from the start of stroke symptoms. Unfortunately, tPA is vastly underutilized with about 3% of stroke patients receiving tPA. The majority of patients fail to receive tPA because they arrive to the hospital after the treatment time window has elapsed (this barrier to tPA administration is known as prehospital delay). Researchers have shown that if 911 were called at the time of stroke onset, over 28% of all stroke patients would receive tPA. Therefore, translational research to increase stroke preparedness (defined as the ability to recognize stroke warning signs and call 911 immediately) is urgently needed. However, the field of stroke preparedness is severely limited by the absence of intermediate end points to test behavioral interventions. Before embarking on large scale, expensive, community intervention trials, phase 2 studies using intermediate end points are needed. An intermediate end point allows for testing of several interventions (phase 2 studies) before deciding on the most promising intervention that warrants phase 3 testing. Intermediate end points also facilitate testing interventions for selected populations such as high risk groups like racial/ethnic minorities or those with low socioeconomic status, rather than an entire community. In this project, we will develop and validate a psychometrically rigorous test of stroke preparedness using video vignettes - the video stroke action test (video-STAT). Because of the increased burden of stroke among African Americans, Hispanics and those with low socioeconomic status, we will oversample from these groups in development and validating of the video-STAT. At completion of this study, an innovative stroke preparedness intermediate end point will be created and critical steps toward validating it will be performed. As the US population ages, stroke will only claim more victims and at greater expense to individuals, families and society. It is critical that we rapidly develop rigorous scientific interventions that increase delivery of acute stroke therapy to decrease post-stroke disability and reduce the enormous impact of this devastating disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute stroke treatments dramatically reduce post-stroke disability but are underutilized mostly because stroke patients do not come to the hospital in time. Interventions aiming to increase the number of stroke patients who get to the hospital quickly are limited by faulty outcome measures. This project seeks to develop and validate a video assessment instrument which will allow for rapid testing and targeting of behavioral interventions to increase the use of acute stroke treatments, and ultimately reduce post-stroke disability.",A stroke preparedness assessment instrument,8810264,R21NS084081,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Michigan ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Motivation ', ' Neurology ', ' Nurses ', ' Patients ', ' t-PA ', ' Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator ', ' Tissue Plasminogen Activator ', ' Tissue Activator D-44 ', ' T-Plasminogen Activator ', ' Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator ', ' Alteplase ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' instrument ', ' Hour ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' stroke therapy ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Symptoms ', ' Intervention Community Trial ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Health behavior change ', ' high risk ', ' phase II study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' 911 call ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2015,196462,0.4462555314050177
"Examining Racial Disparities in Stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the 4th leading cause of US mortality and 3rd among African Americans, with African Americans exhibiting more than twice the risk of Whites. The underlying causes of racial disparities in stroke are unclear. Few studies have systematically evaluated how racial disparities in stroke might vary by socioeconomic and behavior risk factors (e.g. measures of socioeconomic status [SES], adiposity, physical activity and alcohol) and they might explain the observed disparities through their roles as intermediates in the causal pathway between race and stroke. There has been a paucity of research on the impact of socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors in stroke risk prediction. Moreover, validation of existing stroke prediction scores among African Americans is urgently needed. This innovative project will address these gaps in the literature by: (1) determining whether racial disparities in stroke and the associations of selected stroke risk factors by race are comparable in two biracial socioeconomically heterogeneous populations, (2) determining whether mediation by socioeconomic and behavioral stroke risk factors account for racial disparities in stroke beyond traditional stroke risk factors using conventional and causal frameworks, and (3) examining whether race-specific stroke prediction models improve the predictive performance (calibration and discrimination) of long-term stroke risk compared to existing stroke prediction models. These aims will be accomplished through the use of three multi-racial, well-established NIH-funded cohorts; the Women's Health Initiative, Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) and Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke.  A comprehensive approach to examining racial disparities will be utilized. Novel causal mediation analyses will complement conventional epidemiologic methods and move the field forward. Furthermore, race-specific stroke prediction models will enable the development of improved prevention strategies among at-risk individuals. These socioeconomic and behavioral stroke risk factors are often routinely collected in the clinic or could be obtained at minimal cost. This grant will generate new knowledge and crucial training for my advancement to become an independent epidemiologist in the field of racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) by developing my expertise in (1) racial disparities and social determinant of CVD; (2) statistical training in mediation analyses; (3) methodologic training in prediction modeling; (4) data management and analytic skills with Medicare claims data (CMS) for stroke ascertainment in SCCS and (5) pilot medical record collection for stroke validation in SCCS. The advanced training, mentorship and protected time provided by this career development award will provide the skills and experience necessary for conducting the highest quality racial/ethnic cardiovascular disparities research and a strong foundation for success as an independent epidemiologic racial/disparities investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the 4th leading cause of US mortality and 3rd among African Americans, with African Americans exhibiting more than twice the risk of Whites. This proposal will increase our understanding of differences in risk of stroke by race, providing insight into new approaches for prevention and elimination of racial disparities in stroke. By examining the contribution of socioeconomic and behavioral stroke risk factors (measures of SES, adiposity, physical activity and alcohol) to racial disparities in stroke, this proposal will advance knowledge and suggest target areas to decrease disparities, while the limitations of existing prediction scores will be addressed by the development of race-specific risk models which may assist in prevention strategies.",Examining Racial Disparities in Stroke,8898212,K01HL124391,"['Accounting ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Calibration ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' systolic hypertension ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Smoking History ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2015,130086,0.4368614940776495
"Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/Intervention Research Program in Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/ Intervention Research Program in Health Disparities is a partnership of UCLA, four medical centers in the Los Angeles County safety net system, Healthy African American Families, and representatives from multiple community organizations serving low-income minority communities that span the Los Angeles basin. In this most diverse county in the US in race/ethnicity, we propose a multi-disciplinary, highly collaborative Program to create and test sustainable interventions to reduce or eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in the occurrence of stroke, and to generate new knowledge about mechanisms for such disparities. Project I creates a strong community-based component with community health workers and mobile health technology to create a full-fledged Chronic Care Model intervention that will be tested relative to usual care in 500 patients with a recent stroke seen in the Los Angeles County safety net. A cost analysis and a formative evaluation will guide development of a financial sustainability plan. Project II will elucidate the role of novel biological and social risk factors for stroke risk and trends over time, in a nationa data set. Project III builds on an existing close partnership with the City of Los Angeles Department of Aging to develop and test a culturally-tailored behavioral stroke risk factor reduction/walking intervention - delivered by senior center staff-with 240 high risk seniors from Korean, Chinese, African-American and Hispanic racial/ethnic groups. Four cores include an Administrative Core A that supports all three projects; a Research Education and Training Core B that will recruit, retain, and develop stroke disparities-relevant curriculum for academic researchers, community research support personnel and other community stake holders; a Biomarker Collection and Analysis Core C to support Project I and III biomarker data collection, consulting for all three projects, and development of educational programming on biomarkers; and a Community Engagement, Outreach, and Dissemination Core D that supports and interacts with all three projects by promoting and sustaining community-academic partnerships through bidirectional knowledge sharing and by creating strategies for disseminating advances in knowledge about stroke prevention disparities research through outreach to affected communities locally and nationally.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A coordinated effort of researchers and community partners is needed to reduce or eliminate the higher rates of stroke among low-income Latinos, African-Americans, and Asian Americans in underserved communities. The Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/Intervention Program in Health Disparities will carry out research, develop education programs, and share and learn from the community to meet this goal.                ",Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/Intervention Research Program in Health Disparities,8914691,U54NS081764,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Data Collection ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Learning ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' County ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Walking ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Koreans ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' Consult ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' social ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Low income ', ' Academia ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Collection ', ' trend ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' chronic care model ', ' safety net ', ' community organizations ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U54,2015,598645,0.359551817733668

"Developing a system to study stroke rehabilitation in an ethnically diverse community DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mexican Americans (MAs) suffer more from stroke than non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). Ischemic stroke is more common in MAs and their neurologic, functional and cognitive outcomes after stroke are worse than in NHWs. The reasons for the disparity in post-stroke outcome are unclear. Pre-stroke function and initial stroke severity are similar between the two groups as are ischemic stroke sub-types. One potential explanation for the worse post-stroke neurologic, functional and cognitive outcome in MAs compared with NHWs is allocation and effectiveness of post-stroke rehabilitation. There is remarkably little data demonstrating whether rehabilitation is dosed differently for MAs compared with NHWs, and still less information about whether, for a given dose of rehabilitative services following stroke, there is differential benefit by ethnicity. The current application will utilize the existing population-based Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC, NSR0138916) project's infrastructure and strong community relations to develop and pilot a method to collect the necessary data to determine the role of rehabilitation in ethnic disparities in post-stroke outcomes. Previous studies have suggested that looking at overall time spent in rehabilitation does not predict post-stroke outcome. However, specific components of physical, occupational and speech therapy, a practice-based approach, has been shown to be associated with stroke outcomes, and these associations have been shown to vary by race. However, this practice-based approach has not been implemented in a population-based manner across the range of settings where stroke patients receive rehabilitation services, and no study has used this approach in an ethnically diverse population. Therefore, our plan is to build on previous work by developing and utilizing a practice-based design in our population-based stroke study. Specifically, we will 1) continue to build the needed relationships with rehabilitation service providers in the community; 2) work with local rehabilitation therapists to refine data collection instruments as part of the practice-based design; 3) pilot test data collection of specific rehabilitation components of post-stroke rehabilitation across all rehabilitation settings; and 4) analyze this data to determine the feasibility of this approach for a larger study and to provide preliminary data on differences in access and effectiveness by ethnicity. In total, our infrastructure development, refinement of tools to measure specific therapy modalities and pilot testing will position us perfectly to submit an R01 application to identify ethnic differences in access to rehabilitation and specific rehabilitation services associated with improved functional outcome in MAs and NHWs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop the infrastructure and pilot test a framework to understand rehabilitation after stroke among Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites in a population-based study.

"Stroke Counseling for Risk Reduction in Young Adult African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strokes have increased among young adults, and African Americans have a greater prevalence of stroke risk factors than other racial/ethnic groups, a higher incidence of early-onset stroke and more severe stroke-related outcomes. The majority of strokes could be prevented if people recognized their personal risk factors and took steps to reduce their risks. However, many young African American adults do not perceive stroke as a threat. Thus, effective interventions are needed to improve these young African Americans awareness of stroke risk and increase their risk reduction behaviors. The purpose of this mentored research scientist development application is for the investigator to gain a foundation for an independent career focused on primary stroke prevention programs for African Americans. The immediate goals of the investigator are to gain the knowledge and skills needed to (1) design and refine sustainable, theory-based stroke risk assessment counseling and behavior change interventions for at-risk African Americans; (2) implement culturally sensitive behavioral interventions for stroke prevention; and (3) evaluate stroke interventions, including assessment of fidelity and use of advanced statistical methods. To accomplish these training goals and provide a foundation for a productive research career, the investigator will conduct a two-group randomized controlled trial of 116 at-risk African Americans aged 25 to 30 years to evaluate the investigator's Stroke COunseling for Risk REduction (SCORRE) intervention, which personalizes stroke information using age-and culturally relevant video vignettes of stroke champions (e.g., young, inspiring African American stroke survivors) and the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 (LS7) web-based, global risk assessment and education tool. The aims of the proposed research are to (1) test the efficacy of the SCORRE intervention in improving accuracy of perceived stroke risk and increasing targeted risk reduction behaviors (i.e., physical activity, healthy diet, and smoking cessation), and (2) explore theoretical variabls (i.e., knowledge of stroke risk factors, motivation to change behaviors, self-efficacy for behavior change, and readiness for behavior change) and their relationships to increases and adherence to risk reduction behaviors. The results of the proposed study will inform a larger efficacy trial with a longer follow-up to determine the sustainability of the intervention effects. This research will address major stroke disparities by targeting African Americans early in life to reduce stroke risk through personalized stroke information and interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rise of stroke in young adults, the dramatic burden of stroke for African Americans, and current policies designed to strengthen primary care in the United States, provide an opportunity to expand primary stroke prevention efforts. Personalizing stroke risk information for young adult African Americans may result in greater awareness of risk and behavior changes that could reduce their chances of stroke in the future.            ",Stroke Counseling for Risk Reduction in Young Adult African Americans,8868716,K01NR015494,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Awareness ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Mentors ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Mission ', ' Motivation ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Perception ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' behavior change ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' early onset ', ' post intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' ']",NINR,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,92610,0.4613918482587432
"HISPANIC SECONDARY STROKE PREVENTION INITIATIVE DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the main preventable cause of adult disability in the US. Stroke also disproportionately impacts the Hispanic population whose rapid growth and aging will lead to dramatic future increases in the public health impact of stroke. In the Hispanic Secondary Stroke Prevention Initiative we propose a translational research project aimed at reducing the risk for a recurrent stroke. Our focus is on patients having had a stroke since they have over a 25% risk of a recurrent and potentially much more debilitating stroke in the next five years. Our team is currently pursuing two important lines of research aimed at rigorously testing interventions to address disparities in a variety of other health conditions. On is Community Health Workers (CHW), a highly promising approach, for which evidence from RCTs is limited. Our group is also testing mobile health solutions among minorities. We propose to extend this work through a combined CHW/ ProMobile intervention. The study design will be a pragmatic clinical trial of 300 Latino patients in our stroke registry admitted with an acute ischemic stroke and having a moderate disability or less at time of discharge. The intervention will include CHW home visits, coaching phone calls, and group sessions. Cell phone based interactions will include blood pressure monitoring and tailored education messages. We will determine if the proposed intervention results in improving the most important recurrent stroke risk factor which is systolic blood pressure. We will also examine other risk factors including cholesterol, medication adherence, and among diabetic patients, glycemic control. A strength of our study is that it will leverage existing resources, including those of our recently funded strok disparities program and our CTSA. We expect that our translational research project will provide new insights on potential approaches to treatment that can transform medical practice to improve health outcomes in Latino stroke populations. Stroke is a leading cause of death and functional impairments. Stroke also disproportionately affects Latino populations. In the Hispanic Secondary Stroke Prevention Initiative we propose a study using Community Health Workers (CHW) and mobile phone technologies to reduce the risk for a recurrent stroke among Latinos at high risk for second and potentially much debilitating stroke. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is a leading cause of death and functional impairments and stroke risk factors (SRFs) disproportionately affect Latino populations. In the Hispanic Secondary Stroke Prevention Initiative (HiSSPI) we propose a study using Community Health Workers (CHW) and mobile technoloigies using cell phones to reducing the risk for a recurrent stroke among Latino stroke patients.

"Center for Stroke Disaparities Solution     Description (provided by applicant): We seek to establish a Center for Stroke Disparities Solutions, as a consortium between three academic institutions (New York University School of Medicine; Columbia University Medical Center; and SUNY Downstate Medical School); five stroke centers and a practice-based research network of primary care practices within New York City's (NYC) Health and Hospital Corporation (HHC) - the largest municipal healthcare system in the U.S.; the Research Division of the Hebrew Home at Riverdale and the Visiting Nurse Service of New York - the largest nonprofit home healthcare organization in the US. The lead institution is New York University School of Medicine (NYUSOM) and the target communities are Black and Hispanic residents of NYC. The Center's vision is to reduce stroke disparities with a particular focus on prevention of recurrent stroke via: 1) implementation of evidence-based interventions targeted at aggressive management of hypertension among stroke survivors in community-based primary care practices and home healthcare settings; 2) dissemination of a novel, culturally-tailored community-based stroke health education; 3) training of minority investigators in stroke disparities research. The Center's vision will be achieved via the establishment of three cores and three research projects. The Administrative Core (Core A) will oversee all administrative, financial and dissemination activities. The Research Education and Training Plan (Core B) will train minority investigators at the junior faculty level to develop successful academic careers in stroke disparities research. The Research Core (Core C) will provide scientific support for the Center. Cores A and C will support all 3 projects: Project I: Practice-based Trial of Home BP Telemonitoring (HBPTM) Among Minority Stroke Survivors is a comparative effectiveness trial of the effects of HBPTM alone versus HBPTM plus telephonic nurse case management, on BP reduction and prevention of recurrent stroke. Project II: Stroke Community Transitions Intervention uses a mixed-methods design to evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally-tailored transition care program delivered by nurse practitioners and community health workers in improving BP control, functional outcomes and quality of life in homebound post-acute stroke patients. Project III: Tailored Approaches to Stroke Health Education uses a mixed-methods design to test the effectiveness of a novel culturally tailored intervention using storytelling (narrative persuasion) in increasing stroke literacy among adults in Black and Hispanic churches across NYC. All 3 projects address barriers that occur along the continuum of stroke care from the community to homecare, and primary care settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The vision of the Center for Stroke Disparities Solutions is to reduce stroke disparities with a particular focus on prevention of recurrent stroke.

"Effects of early exercise on muscle and cardiovascular health after stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke leads to profound physical deconditioning and abnormalities in paretic leg muscle including shift to fast twitch muscle phenotype, inflammation and gross atrophy that worsen cardiometabolic health by promoting insulin resistance. Yet, no prior studies have considered stroke as a catabolic syndrome in aging that can be modified by early exercise to improve muscle and cardiometabolic health. In chronic stroke, we have exercise models that improve mobility, restore fitness levels nearly 40%, and reverse impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and T2DM status in 58% of cases, even years after stroke. Lab findings suggest our exercise programs increase total myofibrillar protein and proportion of slow twitch in paretic leg muscle, implicating both altered protein synthesis and regulation of muscle molecular phenotype as mechanisms underlying the benefits of exercise post-stroke. This study investigates the hypothesis that in African-Jamaican adults with recent stroke, structured exercise across the sub-acute recovery period and into the chronic phase of stroke care will improve P leg muscle and cardiometabolic health, compared to controls receiving best medical care. Aims and associated hypotheses are to compare effects of 6 months structured and progressive exercise vs. best medical care implemented early after stroke in African-Jamaican adults on: Aim #1. Paretic & non-paretic leg mixed muscle protein synthesis and breakdown in the fed and fasted state, TNF-1 expression, thigh muscle volume and strength. Hypothesis 1: Paretic leg muscle has reduced protein synthesis and increased breakdown compared to non- paretic leg; Exercise will increase mixed muscle protein synthesis and reduce breakdown to increase muscle volume and strength by mechanism(s) of reducing inflammation in paretic leg, compared to controls. Aim #2. Glucose tolerance, fitness, and muscle phenotype. Hypothesis 2: Exercise will improve fitness levels, insulin and glucose response to oral glucose challenge, and increase paretic leg slow twitch muscle phenotype. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic hemiparetic stroke is associated changes in body composition, skeletal muscle and cardiometabolic health; specific changes include paretic limb muscular atrophy, increased intramuscular fat deposition, elevated prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. This randomized intervention study compares a 6 month task oriented exercise programs versus control with both groups receiving best medical stroke care according to American Stroke Association ""Get with the Guidelines"". The hypothesis is that is 6 months of task-oriented exercise initiated early across the sub-acute period of stroke can prevent or ameliorate the natural course of these body composition, skeletal muscle and cardiometabolic health changes.",Effects of early exercise on muscle and cardiovascular health after stroke,8831705,R01HD068712,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+

"HISPANIC SECONDARY STROKE PREVENTION INITIATIVE DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the main preventable cause of adult disability in the US. Stroke also disproportionately impacts the Hispanic population whose rapid growth and aging will lead to dramatic future increases in the public health impact of stroke. In the Hispanic Secondary Stroke Prevention Initiative we propose a translational research project aimed at reducing the risk for a recurrent stroke. Our focus is on patients having had a stroke since they have over a 25% risk of a recurrent and potentially much more debilitating stroke in the next five years. Our team is currently pursuing two important lines of research aimed at rigorously testing interventions to address disparities in a variety of other health conditions. On is Community Health Workers (CHW), a highly promising approach, for which evidence from RCTs is limited. Our group is also testing mobile health solutions among minorities. We propose to extend this work through a combined CHW/ ProMobile intervention. The study design will be a pragmatic clinical trial of 300 Latino patients in our stroke registry admitted with an acute ischemic stroke and having a moderate disability or less at time of discharge. The intervention will include CHW home visits, coaching phone calls, and group sessions. Cell phone based interactions will include blood pressure monitoring and tailored education messages. We will determine if the proposed intervention results in improving the most important recurrent stroke risk factor which is systolic blood pressure. We will also examine other risk factors including cholesterol, medication adherence, and among diabetic patients, glycemic control. A strength of our study is that it will leverage existing resources, including those of our recently funded strok disparities program and our CTSA. We expect that our translational research project will provide new insights on potential approaches to treatment that can transform medical practice to improve health outcomes in Latino stroke populations. Stroke is a leading cause of death and functional impairments. Stroke also disproportionately affects Latino populations. In the Hispanic Secondary Stroke Prevention Initiative we propose a study using Community Health Workers (CHW) and mobile phone technologies to reduce the risk for a recurrent stroke among Latinos at high risk for second and potentially much debilitating stroke. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is a leading cause of death and functional impairments and stroke risk factors (SRFs) disproportionately affect Latino populations. In the Hispanic Secondary Stroke Prevention Initiative (HiSSPI) we propose a study using Community Health Workers (CHW) and mobile technoloigies using cell phones to reducing the risk for a recurrent stroke among Latino stroke patients. The project examines the effectiveness of a combined multilevel intervention consisting of Community Health Workers and mobile based phone technologies in lowering of systolic blood pressure which is

"Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Stroke has the largest racial disparity of any chronic disease, Geographic disparities also exist, and the magnitude of both disparities is increasing. Alarmingly, REGARDS has documented racial and geographic disparities in cognitive decline that are of the same magnitude as for stroke. A lack of understanding of the causes of these disparities has contributed directly to the failure to reduce or eliminate them.  REGARDS is a national cohort of 30,239 black and white community-dwelling participants aged 45+ when enrolled in 2003-2007. We propose to utilize the cohort to build on findings to date and extend our findings to evaluate new hypotheses. REGARDS is positioned to document disparities in incidence of stroke and cognitive impairment and also to understand why these disparities exist.  We propose to conduct a second in-person evaluation to define incidence and progression of stroke risk factors. We will continue stroke ascertainment to double the number of stroke events and improve our ability to define factors contributing to the as yet ""unexplained"" stroke disparities. By continuing cognitive assessments, and adding more sensitive in-person measures of cognitive function, and instrumental activities of daily living, we will advance the understanding of causes and clinical relevance of disparities in cognitive decline. We propose the following specific aims:  ¿ Specific Aim #1: to quantify incidence of, and change in severity of stroke risk factors over  9 years of follow-up, and to establish causes for racial and geographic disparities in these  risk factors.  ¿ Specific Aim #2: to evaluate three pathways that may account for ""unexplained"" disparities:  a) differential impact of risk factors where the same change in risk factor increases risk  more for one race than the other, b) residual confounding from incomplete characterization  of risk factors, and c) ""novel"" stroke risk factors including psychosocial and behavioral  factors.  ¿ Specific Aim #3: Measure the functional impact of cognitive impairment, estimate the  prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment over 10 years of follow-up, and account  for racial disparities in cognition attributable to literacy by gathering new information on  functional performance and word reading ability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Estimates suggest that the racial and geographic disparities in stroke are associated with over 20,000 ""extra"" stroke events annually, with an estimated cost per stroke of $140,000; hence, the public health burden of these disparities is in excess of $6 billion dollars annually. If this research provides insights that would contribute to a 10% reduction in the magnitude of these disparities, the entire 5-year cost of this application would be recouped in savings in less than 16 days (a savings that would reoccur each 16 days). Our previous work in REGARDS has documented similar racial and geographic disparities in cognitive function, and these disparities in cognitive function will have similar public health ramifications with the ""graying of America.""",Etiology of Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke,8984324,U01NS041588,"['Accounting ', ' Americas ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' literacy ', ' living will ', ' Living Wills ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Paper ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' Gray ', ' Gray unit of radiation dose ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' reading ability ', ' reading proficiency ', ' reading competence ', ' reading achievement ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' black/white disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2016,5277889,0.30486787163094886
"Center for Stroke Disaparities Solution     Description (provided by applicant): We seek to establish a Center for Stroke Disparities Solutions, as a consortium between three academic institutions (New York University School of Medicine; Columbia University Medical Center; and SUNY Downstate Medical School); five stroke centers and a practice-based research network of primary care practices within New York City's (NYC) Health and Hospital Corporation (HHC) - the largest municipal healthcare system in the U.S.; the Research Division of the Hebrew Home at Riverdale and the Visiting Nurse Service of New York - the largest nonprofit home healthcare organization in the US. The lead institution is New York University School of Medicine (NYUSOM) and the target communities are Black and Hispanic residents of NYC. The Center's vision is to reduce stroke disparities with a particular focus on prevention of recurrent stroke via: 1) implementation of evidence-based interventions targeted at aggressive management of hypertension among stroke survivors in community-based primary care practices and home healthcare settings; 2) dissemination of a novel, culturally-tailored community-based stroke health education; 3) training of minority investigators in stroke disparities research. The Center's vision will be achieved via the establishment of three cores and three research projects. The Administrative Core (Core A) will oversee all administrative, financial and dissemination activities. The Research Education and Training Plan (Core B) will train minority investigators at the junior faculty level to develop successful academic careers in stroke disparities research. The Research Core (Core C) will provide scientific support for the Center. Cores A and C will support all 3 projects: Project I: Practice-based Trial of Home BP Telemonitoring (HBPTM) Among Minority Stroke Survivors is a comparative effectiveness trial of the effects of HBPTM alone versus HBPTM plus telephonic nurse case management, on BP reduction and prevention of recurrent stroke. Project II: Stroke Community Transitions Intervention uses a mixed-methods design to evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally-tailored transition care program delivered by nurse practitioners and community health workers in improving BP control, functional outcomes and quality of life in homebound post-acute stroke patients. Project III: Tailored Approaches to Stroke Health Education uses a mixed-methods design to test the effectiveness of a novel culturally tailored intervention using storytelling (narrative persuasion) in increasing stroke literacy among adults in Black and Hispanic churches across NYC.

While traditional stroke risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes contribute to racial disparities in cerebrovascular outcomes, they are not sufficient to completely explain these findings, suggesting that non-traditional risk factors play an important role. Disturbances in vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism have emerged as non-traditional risk factors for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels are associated with heart disease and death via broad effects on inflammation, insulin resistance and blood pressure control. Disturbances in phosphorus metabolism stimulate the secretion of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a bone-derived hormone that maintains phosphorus homeostasis in part by inhibiting the conversion of 25D to its activated metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). Our group and others showed that higher FGF23 levels were associated with adverse outcomes through direct and indirect effects promoting cardiovascular disease and 1,25D deficiency. Moreover, preliminary data from our group suggest that low vitamin D is an independent risk factor for stroke and cognitive impairment. The primary focus of the current proposal is to build upon this prior work by determining whether low plasma 25D levels and excess plasma FGF23 levels are associated with incident stroke and cognitive impairment in a large, national cohort (Aim 1). In addition, since disorders of vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism are more common and severe in blacks than whites, we will determine if they partly underlie racial disparities in stroke (Aim 2). Finally, given that inflammation, insulin resistance and hypertension are key risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, and are interconnected with disturbances in vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism, we will determine whether they partly mediate the associations of 25D and FGF23 with stroke and cognitive decline. We will test these hypotheses by measuring plasma 25D, FGF23 and other key mediators of mineral metabolism including 1,25D, parathyroid hormone, calcium and phosphate in stored blood samples from a specified case cohort of 2,085 participants of the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, a national prospective study of black and white adults designed to identify novel risk factors for racial disparities in stroke. The case-cohort to be used for this study has available measures of inflammation and insulin resistance, making it uniquely well-suited to test our hypotheses. The results of these studies may have an important impact on the treatment and/or prevention of stroke and cognitive decline. Indeed, 25D deficiency and FGF23 excess are common in the general population, disproportionately impact blacks, and can be treated with safe and relatively inexpensive therapies. Thus, if vitamin D deficiency and excess FGF23 are risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, this would support intervention trials testing the treatment of these disorders in reducing rates of incident stroke and cognitive impairment, particularly among black individuals. Disorders of vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism are strongly linked to cardiovascular disease. The studies proposed herein will clarify the role of vitamin D deficiency and excess levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 in stroke, cognitive impairment, and racial disparities in these outcomes. Since vitamin D deficiency and elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 levels are common and disproportionately impact blacks, these studies may uncover novel therapeutic strategies for improving cerebrovascular outcomes in the general population, particularly among African Americans.",Impact of disordered mineral metabolism on stroke and cognitive impairment,9096906,R01NS080850,"['Accounting

"PeRiodontal treatment to Eliminate Minority InEquality and Rural disparities in Stroke (PREMIERS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death and the leading cause of long-term adult disability in the United States. Stroke remains more common in North and South Carolina, part of the ""buckle"" of the stroke belt, and disproportionately impacts African Americans. The reasons for this racial disparity are poorly understood and are not entirely explained by traditional stroke risk factors. The REGARDS study found that tooth loss (a surrogate of periodontal disease) was more common among African Americans than whites and was associated with higher stroke risk and stroke risk factors. Given this result, REGARDS investigators postulated that periodontal disease may be contributing to the racial disparity in stroke. Additional data from this study shows that low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with greater tooth loss, both of which are seen more frequently in African Americans as opposed to their white counterparts. Considering these factors, a question arises about whether low SES, race, a combination of the two, and/or traditional risk factors contribute to tooth loss, periodontl disease, and recurrent vascular events. Howard and colleagues suggest in their paper that race is the predominant factor contributing to vascular events after adjustment for SES and risk factors. If the predisposition exists among African Americans for greater periodontal disease and incident vascular events, then what modifications can clinicians make to prevent recurrent vascular events in this population? The PREMIERS study is a application for conducting an adequately powered two-center Phase III randomized controlled trial to test whether intensive periodontal treatment reduces the risk of recurrent vascular events among ischemic stroke and TIA survivors. The study uses the resources in both states including established dental centers, Joint Commission Certified Stroke Centers, the Schools of Public Health, and the Institute for Partnerships to Eliminate Health Disparities. The application addresses specific issues with regards to recruitment of African-American and rural stroke/TIA patients advocating the use of culturally appropriate strategies to educate the study subjects regarding stroke, periodontal disease and the periodontal stroke link. The study proposes to utilize economic evaluation of the periodontal intervention from the budgetary perspective. The focus will be on the financial sustainability of providing aggressive periodontal therapy (with certain, although relatively low expenditures) in exchange for a reduction of uncertain recurrent vascular events that may require high cost emergency department utilization and/or inpatient care. The sustainability of the proposed intervention after the completion of the project is integrally linked to the health economic assessment to show the health care cost savings. By integration with a rural primary care center, with an African American majority and households with average incomes below the state average, the study ensures that the proposed intervention to reduce stroke disparity is applicable to this target population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and periodontal disease are prevalent among African Americans residing in North Carolina and South Carolina, states recognized as the ""buckle"" of the stroke belt. Advanced periodontal disease is associated with an increased risk of recurrent vascular events in stroke/TIA patients. We propose a two-center Phase III randomized, controlled trial that will improve the understanding of biological mechanisms of stroke disparities, including race and socioeconomic status, through improved periodontal care.",PeRiodontal treatment to Eliminate Minority InEquality and Rural disparities in Stroke (PREMIERS),9096903,R01MD009738,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', '

"Center for Stroke Disaparities Solution     Description (provided by applicant): We seek to establish a Center for Stroke Disparities Solutions, as a consortium between three academic institutions (New York University School of Medicine; Columbia University Medical Center; and SUNY Downstate Medical School); five stroke centers and a practice-based research network of primary care practices within New York City's (NYC) Health and Hospital Corporation (HHC) - the largest municipal healthcare system in the U.S.; the Research Division of the Hebrew Home at Riverdale and the Visiting Nurse Service of New York - the largest nonprofit home healthcare organization in the US. The lead institution is New York University School of Medicine (NYUSOM) and the target communities are Black and Hispanic residents of NYC. The Center's vision is to reduce stroke disparities with a particular focus on prevention of recurrent stroke via: 1) implementation of evidence-based interventions targeted at aggressive management of hypertension among stroke survivors in community-based primary care practices and home healthcare settings; 2) dissemination of a novel, culturally-tailored community-based stroke health education; 3) training of minority investigators in stroke disparities research. The Center's vision will be achieved via the establishment of three cores and three research projects. The Administrative Core (Core A) will oversee all administrative, financial and dissemination activities. The Research Education and Training Plan (Core B) will train minority investigators at the junior faculty level to develop successful academic careers in stroke disparities research. The Research Core (Core C) will provide scientific support for the Center. Cores A and C will support all 3 projects: Project I: Practice-based Trial of Home BP Telemonitoring (HBPTM) Among Minority Stroke Survivors is a comparative effectiveness trial of the effects of HBPTM alone versus HBPTM plus telephonic nurse case management, on BP reduction and prevention of recurrent stroke. Project II: Stroke Community Transitions Intervention uses a mixed-methods design to evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally-tailored transition care program delivered by nurse practitioners and community health workers in improving BP control, functional outcomes and quality of life in homebound post-acute stroke patients. Project III: Tailored Approaches to Stroke Health Education uses a mixed-methods design to test the effectiveness of a novel culturally tailored intervention using storytelling (narrative persuasion) in increasing stroke literacy among adults in Black and Hispanic churches across NYC.

"Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to continue our population-based study of stroke incidence and case fatality, prevalence of risk factors, stroke treatment, and post-stroke outcomes within a biracial metropolitan population of 1,368,604 of whom 223,417 (16.3%) are of black race (US Census 2010). The proposed work will involve an anticipated ~3,750 patients with 4,250 strokes and/or transient ischemic attacks from our region in 2014/2015, an estimated ~600 recurrent strokes from 2015-2018 (following all strokes and transient ischemic attacks for 3 years after the original 2014/2015 event), as well as 2,000 survey participants.  For almost 20 years, we have studied trends in stroke incidence and case fatality and have demonstrated a racial disparity where stroke incidence in African-Americans is more than double that of whites. In each prior study period, we have also examined the prevalence of risk factors (and knowledge of stroke) via a population survey in order to put our temporal trend findings into context.  In addition to continuing these important activities, we seek to examine stroke recurrence in a population- based fashion (which has not been done since the 1990's) with the goal of identifying whether there is a racial disparity in stroke recurrence. We propose an innovative pilot study to determine if we can estimate functional outcome and place of residence at 3- and 6-months post-stroke without patient contact, using a local health- information exchange (HIE) and electronic health record. We will compare our estimate to phone interviews with the subject as the ""gold standard""; the phone interview to be used was successfully piloted in the current period. Finally, we have used our data to inform eligibility for stroke clinical trils. We propose to share our data with the scientific community for this purpose. In our proposed work, we will have data regarding acute stroke presentation and will add information about stroke recurrence and post-stroke functional outcomes that can be used for rational planning of stroke interventions in all phases of stroke (acute, secondary prevention, recovery).  In all of th proposed activities, the use of the HIE will make the proposed work possible (harnessing the power of centralized health data) and will be important for accomplishing the work efficiently. Overall, our proposed study will accomplish more than prior periods in a shorter time and without increased cost. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The change in stroke occurrence and recurrence over time is the ultimate test of how well science has translated new discoveries into benefits for the population. Our study has examined racial disparities in stroke over the last 20 years, showing that blacks have higher risk for stroke than whites.

"University of Wisconsin Regional Coordinating Center (UW RCC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Wisconsin-Madison Regional Coordinating Stroke Center (UW RCC) wiii support the regional organization of national NIH Stroke Trials. This will include prevention, treatment, and recovery. This RCC infrastructure will be based on the already established Wisconsin Network for Health Research (WiNHR), an NIH-sponsored research consortium including academic, urban, rural, and underserved and health disparity populations. It includes four major health systems with a total of 12.7 million outpatient visits per year. In addition to the WiNHR network, 26 additional health entities have been recruited for participation in this RCC including Native American communities. Experience in data correlation, study coordination, and CTSA infrastructure, will assure innovative training and success in the effort. Our experience in collaborative research will foster translation of preclinical and clinical trials, as well as a proven ability to recruit stroke patients. This integration of neurosurgery, vascular neurology, neurosurgery, interventional neuroradiology, neuro-intensive care, stroke rehabilitation, emergency medicine, pediatric neurology, and innovative neuro- imaging will enhance productivity. Through investigator initiated stroke research, training and trial design, we propose to enhance the overall national programs in stroke research rather than simply manage trials. Our plan is: 1) to improve the pre-hospital plan for acute stroke through collaborations with satellite hospitals. 2) To utilize established networks such as the Wisconsin Network for Health Research (WiNHR), Collaborative Center for Health Equity (CCHE), Community Health Connections (CHC), and expanding Telestroke never for enjoyment of our diverse patient population in clinical trials. 3) To educate providers across the care spec aim at the pre-hospital, satellite hospital, and tertiary referral hospital setting. 4) To improve clinical, IRB,-and data management infrastructure for satellite hospitals through trial protocol and data management experts available within existing infrastructure at the University of Wisconsin including the Institute for Collaborative and Transitional Research (ICTR), Office of Clinical Trials (OCT), and the Mobile Research Team (MRT).

"Built environments on stroke risk and stroke disparities in a national sample ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and a top cause of serious long-term disability. A number of stroke risk factors have been established at the individual-level; however, these risk factors only partially explain stroke risk and account for only half of the racial disparities in stroke. Novel exposures of stroke risk must be identifie to improve our understanding of stroke risk and to develop effective interventions. Recently, built and social environments (BSEs) have been identified as important factors to examine to further our understanding of cardiovascular disease. However, to date no studies have examined the effect of BSEs on stroke risk. BSEs may also help to explain the large racial and geographic disparities in stroke rates although this has yet to be empirically examined nationally. The proposed study would address these gaps by utilizing a unique assembled cohort, namely the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. The REGARDS cohort is a national sample of adults over age 45, with oversamples of African-American participants and persons in the stroke belt. The proposed study will expand the REGARDS study to examine the effects of BSEs on incident stroke risk and on racial and geographic disparities in stroke. These aims will be achieved by obtaining data on a broad range of BSE characteristics of the REGARDS participants' built environment (e.g., food availability, park availability, food prices, physical activity facility availability, land use, steet connectivity and neighborhood physical environment) and participants' social environment (objective crime, perceived crime, neighborhood SES, social cohesion, racial residential segregation, social support and social networks, and neighborhood social environment). The data will be obtained from a number of sources including secondary commercial and administrative sources, participant self-reports and primary audits using the Street View feature in Google Earth. Environmental data will be spatially linked to participant data of the REGARDS case-cohort study. The proposed study aims to 1) examine the extent to which BSEs contribute to incident stroke risk in the REGARDS study; and 2) determine the extent to which BSEs explain racial and geographic disparities in incident stroke. The proposed study builds on important preliminary studies and the extensive relevant experience of the investigative team, which includes prominent scholars across a number of institutions. The proposed research provides a cost-effective way to examine the importance of BSEs for stroke prevention across diverse community settings and racial groups. Identifying the BSE characteristics that are predictive of incident stroke and BSEs that contribute to racial and geographic disparities will help inform future modifications of environments to improve population health. At the end of the study period, the BSE data will be made available to others through the REGARDS data sharing protocols; thus the measures in the proposed study will be available to the greater scientific community for use in research pertaining to other disease outcomes.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is a leading cause of death and serious long-term disability. The goal of this study is to identify salient built and social environmental factors tht are associated with risk of incident stroke and how those factors contribute to racial and geographical disparities in stroke. This information is critical for making informed decisions about how to modify environments to improve population health in an aging population.            ",Built environments on stroke risk and stroke disparities in a national sample,9103608,R01NS092706,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' American Heart Association ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Crime ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' United States ', ' Destinations ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' Physical environment ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' land use ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' Institution ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' community safety ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' effective intervention ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' population health ', ' sharing data ', ' Secure ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' built environment ', ' walkability ', ' walkable ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,663955,0.4216389608639952
"A Community Partnership to Treat Stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans suffer a disproportionate number of strokes resulting in greater post-stroke disability and mortality compared to European Americans. Despite the fact that tissue plasminogen activase (tPA), decreases post-stroke morbidity, mortality and is cost saving, it is underutilized especially among African Americans who are up to one-fifth as likely to receive tPA as European Americans. The primary reason for the underutilization of acute stroke treatments is delayed patient presentation to the hospital which would be remedied by increasing prompt 911 calls for stroke. If all patients presented to the hospital immediately over 25% of stroke patients would receive tPA compared with the 1-3% that are currently treated. The long-term goal of this career development award is to promote the candidate's development into a clinical and research leader in behavioral interventions focusing on health disparities of neurologic disease. The aims of this project are 1)To develop and validate theory-based stroke education intervention materials and outcome measures that use simulated stroke patient video vignettes; 2)To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a faith-based, scientific theory-driven, peer-led behavioral intervention to increase stroke awareness and behavioral intent to call 911 among African American youth and adults in Flint, Michigan. This project is based on a partnership with Bridges into the Future, an African American faith-based community group in Flint, Michigan who will help to design and pre test novel intervention materials and outcome assessments. Then a single group repeated measures design feasibility study will be conducted to obtain preliminary evidence for the impact of our adapted intervention and to test the novel stroke outcome measure. The candidate is committed to a career as a rigorously trained clinician scientist and requires additional training in order to accomplish her long-term goal of reducing health disparities in neurologic disease via behavioral interventions. A detailed career development plan will promote the candidate's development of expertise in the science of behavioral interventions, advanced statistical analysis and an interdisciplinary understanding of health disparities. The career development plan consists of a multidisciplinary team of experts in each of these areas who will oversee a range of formal coursework, working meetings and practical experiences in these areas to ensure the candidate's future success. Excellent resources of a top university and a mentoring team with demonstrated success in developing junior investigators in these topic areas makes the University of Michigan an ideal environment for this project. Getting to the hospital quickly is the key to treating stroke. African Americans suffer more strokes with worse outcomes and receive stroke treatments less often than European Americans. This project will work to reduce these health disparities by creating and testing the feasibility of a peer-led faith-based behavioral intervention in an African American community with a goal to increase calls to 911 so stroke patients can be treated quickly.",A Community Partnership to Treat Stroke,9221383,K23NS073685,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Awareness ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Profibrinolysin ', ' EC 3.4.21.7 ', ' Plasminogen ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' European ', ' satisfaction ', ' Development Plans ', ' Sample Size ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Activase ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' stroke therapy ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' stroke education ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' loved ones ', ' faith-based intervention ', ' 911 call ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' stroke symptom ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2016,1620,0.39985285295205086
"Outcomes Among Surrogate decision makers In Stroke (OASIS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every day in hospitals across the country, patients with severe stroke and their families are faced with decisions about life-sustaining treatments in the initial hours of admission. These decisions about resuscitation status, invasive treatments, or possible transitions to comfort care are typically made by a surrogate decision- maker due to communication or cognitive deficits in the patient. This surrogate must consider the patient's life goals and values to determine if their loved one would choose on-going intensive treatments where they may survive and yet have long term disabilities, or prioritize comfort and accept the likelihood of an earlier death. Serving as a surrogate decision maker for a patient in the intensive care unit can have long lasting negative consequences. However, almost nothing is known about surrogate decision makers in diverse populations with stroke. Hispanic Americans are now the largest minority group in the US, rapidly growing and aging, with Mexican Americans comprising the largest subgroup. Multiple disparities have been identified in stroke incidence and outcome between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites, particularly in the use of life- sustaining treatments. Minority populations may be particularly vulnerable to inadequate communication about end-of-life issues due to socioeconomic disadvantage, poor health literacy, and lack of provider empathy and health system strategies to improve communication. However, Mexican American culture includes strong values of family support and religiosity that may have a positive influence on discussions about life-sustaining treatment and adapting to stroke-related disabilities. There is currently a critical gap in understanding the perspectives and outcomes of stroke surrogate decision makers, making it impossible to design interventions to help diverse populations of patients and families through this incredibly trying time. The aims of this proposal are 1) To assess physician quality of communication, shared decision-making, and quality of end-of-life care among stroke surrogate decision makers; and 2) To assess the long-term impact of serving as a surrogate decision maker for stroke and assess the unmet decision support needs of stroke surrogates. Results will be used to design future targeted decision support interventions for diverse populations of stroke patients and family members. This proposal takes advantage of the extensive established infrastructure of the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS038916), a population based epidemiological stroke surveillance study recently funded for its fourth 5-year cycle. New prospectively obtained data on surrogate decision-maker outcomes using established validated measures will be linked to BASIC's rich longitudinal patient-level data on functional outcome to maximize efficiency. Leveraging the resources of this highly successful project will allow a comprehensive yet cost-effective investigation that would not otherwise be feasible to study in a prospective longitudinal cohort design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently, very little is known about the experience and outcomes of family members who make medical decisions for individuals with stroke. Results from this project will improve our understanding of the early and long-range consequences of these challenging decisions in diverse populations and help to develop specific interventions to reduce the emotional and psychological burden on family members.",Outcomes Among Surrogate decision makers In Stroke (OASIS),9129770,R01NS091112,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Aging ', ' Anxiety ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Empathy ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Minority Groups ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physicians ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Regrets ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Family member ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Country ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Emotional ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Health system ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health literacy ', ' attributable death ', ' attributable mortality ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' loved ones ', ' population based ', ' surveillance study ', ' quality of death ', ' quality of dying ', ' shared decision making ', ' surrogate decision maker ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' family support ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,521414,0.26608912840488264
"Reducing Racial Disparities in Post-Stroke Disability in the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is common, nearly 800,000 strokes occur annually, and a leading cause of disability in the U.S. Non-Hispanic Black/African American (Black) adults have the highest stroke prevalence and suffer the most post-stroke disability of any U.S. racial/ethnic group. Even though racial disparities in post-stroke disability are widespread, little it is known about how to reduce this disparity. Racial differences in disability arise in the post-stroke period; however it is unclear if these differences arise shortly after strke in the early recovery period, when many stroke survivors are undergoing rehabilitation, or after stroke survivors return to the community. This project will address the critical questions of when racial disparities in post-stroke disability arise and determine the drivers of this disparity in ech period. Answering these questions is an essential step to designing interventions to improve health in Black stroke survivors and reduce disparities. To address these questions, we will rely on the newly available National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) linked to Medicare claims and functional assessment data. NHATS is a national, longitudinal survey of Medicare beneficiaries focused on understanding the causes and consequences of disability in the elderly. NHATS performs annual face-to-face interviews to carefully characterize disability in the elderly and measures a vast array of disability predictors including social, community and disability accommodation factors. Additionally NHATS's linkage to Medicare claims will enable measurement of important medical and rehabilitation factors that may also explain racial differences in post-stroke disability. These data sources will be used to develop the first comprehensive measures of rehabilitation intensity across all rehabilitation settings-home health, outpatient, skilled nursing and inpatient rehabilitation-compare intensity by race and estimate the effect of rehabilitation intensity on disability disparities. At the completion of the study, the timing and drivers of race differences in post-stroke disability will be identified. Furthermore, our novel measures of rehabilitation intensity can serve as a prototype for use in studying the role of rehabilitation in other diseases such as traumatic brain injury and arthritis. This proposal is particularly responsive to the NIMHD solicitation in that it focuses on modifiable drivers of racial differences in post-stroke disability from a policy standpoint and will directly inform stroke survivor and family level strategies to reduce disability and decrease disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-Hispanic Black/African American (Black) adults have more strokes and experience greater disability after their strokes than non-Hispanic White adults. Using newly available data, this project will determine the time when racial differences in post-stroke disability arise and the factors that lead to racial differences in post- stroke disabiity. These results will be directly used to develop strategies and interventions to improve the health of Black stroke survivors and reduce disparities.",Reducing Racial Disparities in Post-Stroke Disability in the Elderly,9039659,R01MD008879,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Arthritis ', ' Attention ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Home Health Agency ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Extended Care Facilities ', ' Skilled Nursing Facilities ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Life ', ' social rehab ', ' social rehabilitation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' trend ', ' Modification ', ' beneficiary ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' community living ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' prototype ', ' Medicare claim ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' stroke survivor ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,387500,0.22415093848868395

"Examining Racial Disparities in Stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the 4th leading cause of US mortality and 3rd among African Americans, with African Americans exhibiting more than twice the risk of Whites. The underlying causes of racial disparities in stroke are unclear. Few studies have systematically evaluated how racial disparities in stroke might vary by socioeconomic and behavior risk factors (e.g. measures of socioeconomic status [SES], adiposity, physical activity and alcohol) and they might explain the observed disparities through their roles as intermediates in the causal pathway between race and stroke. There has been a paucity of research on the impact of socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors in stroke risk prediction. Moreover, validation of existing stroke prediction scores among African Americans is urgently needed. This innovative project will address these gaps in the literature by: (1) determining whether racial disparities in stroke and the associations of selected stroke risk factors by race are comparable in two biracial socioeconomically heterogeneous populations, (2) determining whether mediation by socioeconomic and behavioral stroke risk factors account for racial disparities in stroke beyond traditional stroke risk factors using conventional and causal frameworks, and (3) examining whether race-specific stroke prediction models improve the predictive performance (calibration and discrimination) of long-term stroke risk compared to existing stroke prediction models. These aims will be accomplished through the use of three multi-racial, well-established NIH-funded cohorts; the Women's Health Initiative, Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) and Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke.  A comprehensive approach to examining racial disparities will be utilized. Novel causal mediation analyses will complement conventional epidemiologic methods and move the field forward. Furthermore, race-specific stroke prediction models will enable the development of improved prevention strategies among at-risk individuals. These socioeconomic and behavioral stroke risk factors are often routinely collected in the clinic or could be obtained at minimal cost. This grant will generate new knowledge and crucial training for my advancement to become an independent epidemiologist in the field of racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) by developing my expertise in (1) racial disparities and social determinant of CVD; (2) statistical training in mediation analyses; (3) methodologic training in prediction modeling; (4) data management and analytic skills with Medicare claims data (CMS) for stroke ascertainment in SCCS and (5) pilot medical record collection for stroke validation in SCCS. The advanced training, mentorship and protected time provided by this career development award will provide the skills and experience necessary for conducting the highest quality racial/ethnic cardiovascular disparities research and a strong foundation for success as an independent epidemiologic racial/disparities investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the 4th leading cause of US mortality and 3rd among African Americans, with African Americans exhibiting more than twice the risk of Whites. This proposal will increase our understanding of differences in risk of stroke by race, providing insight into new approaches for prevention and elimination of racial disparities in stroke. By examining the contribution of socioeconomic and behavioral stroke risk factors (measures of SES, adiposity, physical activity and alcohol) to racial disparities in stroke, this proposal will advance knowledge and suggest target areas to decrease disparities, while the limitations of existing prediction scores will be addressed by the development of race-specific risk models which may assist in prevention strategies.",Examining Racial Disparities in Stroke,9102763,K01HL124391,"['Accounting ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Calibration ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentorship ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' systolic hypertension ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Smoking History ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' Data Analytics ', ' biracial ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2016,143937,0.4368614940776495
"Stroke Counseling for Risk Reduction in Young Adult African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strokes have increased among young adults, and African Americans have a greater prevalence of stroke risk factors than other racial/ethnic groups, a higher incidence of early-onset stroke and more severe stroke-related outcomes. The majority of strokes could be prevented if people recognized their personal risk factors and took steps to reduce their risks. However, many young African American adults do not perceive stroke as a threat. Thus, effective interventions are needed to improve these young African Americans awareness of stroke risk and increase their risk reduction behaviors. The purpose of this mentored research scientist development application is for the investigator to gain a foundation for an independent career focused on primary stroke prevention programs for African Americans. The immediate goals of the investigator are to gain the knowledge and skills needed to (1) design and refine sustainable, theory-based stroke risk assessment counseling and behavior change interventions for at-risk African Americans; (2) implement culturally sensitive behavioral interventions for stroke prevention; and (3) evaluate stroke interventions, including assessment of fidelity and use of advanced statistical methods. To accomplish these training goals and provide a foundation for a productive research career, the investigator will conduct a two-group randomized controlled trial of 116 at-risk African Americans aged 25 to 30 years to evaluate the investigator's Stroke COunseling for Risk REduction (SCORRE) intervention, which personalizes stroke information using age-and culturally relevant video vignettes of stroke champions (e.g., young, inspiring African American stroke survivors) and the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 (LS7) web-based, global risk assessment and education tool. The aims of the proposed research are to (1) test the efficacy of the SCORRE intervention in improving accuracy of perceived stroke risk and increasing targeted risk reduction behaviors (i.e., physical activity, healthy diet, and smoking cessation), and (2) explore theoretical variabls (i.e., knowledge of stroke risk factors, motivation to change behaviors, self-efficacy for behavior change, and readiness for behavior change) and their relationships to increases and adherence to risk reduction behaviors. The results of the proposed study will inform a larger efficacy trial with a longer follow-up to determine the sustainability of the intervention effects. This research will address major stroke disparities by targeting African Americans early in life to reduce stroke risk through personalized stroke information and interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rise of stroke in young adults, the dramatic burden of stroke for African Americans, and current policies designed to strengthen primary care in the United States, provide an opportunity to expand primary stroke prevention efforts. Personalizing stroke risk information for young adult African Americans may result in greater awareness of risk and behavior changes that could reduce their chances of stroke in the future.            ",Stroke Counseling for Risk Reduction in Young Adult African Americans,9149030,K01NR015494,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Awareness ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Mentors ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Mission ', ' Motivation ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Perception ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' behavior change ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' early onset ', ' post intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' modifiable risk ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke intervention ', ' ']",NINR,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,92610,0.4613918482587432
"Genetic evaluation of two novel loci associated with recurrent stroke Abstract Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and the number one cause of serious, long term disability. Of the nearly 800,000 annual strokes, approximately 25% will be recurrent events. Unfortunately, recurrent strokes are more deadly and most likely to cause disability when compared to a first stroke. Genetic studies focusing on recurrent stroke have been extremely limited. We have identified two novel gene regions associated with recurrent stroke and aim to use next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) to fine-map these regions to hone in on the likely causal variants. For 182 recurrent stroke patients from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) clinical trial, we will utilize NGS platforms to identify all genetic variants across 1.5 Mb spanning the two novel gene regions associated with recurrent stroke. High priority variants will be genotyped in all 2,100 VISP participants and analyzed for association with recurrent stroke. NGS is a cutting edge technology that provides a powerful approach to identify novel and important genetic contributors to recurrent stroke, a phenotype that has been poorly studied. This approach may allow improved personalization of risk assessment and targeted prevention. Moreover, VISP participants include both African Americans (AA) and European Americans, therefore this proposal may identify genetic risk variants specific to populations of African descent that might not otherwise be identified in other studies focused primarily on populations of European ancestry. These variants may help address why African Americans have nearly 2x greater risk of suffering a stroke, and are more likely to die following a stroke, as compared to European Americans. Furthermore, these findings may have broader implications by providing insight on other issues influencing recurrent stroke such as the ability to control manageable risk factors (e.g. hypertension and atrial fibrillation) and likewise one’s response to treatment for anticoagulation, antiplatelet, and antihypertensive medications. Moreover, these finding may reflect post stroke treatment response to tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only FDA approved treatment for ischemic stroke. Aligned with the goals of the NIH Academic Research Enhancement Award (AREA) Program (R15), we aim to explore a significant research question while exposing students to research, in particular learning cutting edge skills in Genomics, Population Genetics, Biotechnology techniques involving NGS library preparations, and Bioinformatics skills focused on analyzing NGS data and performing statistical analyses for genetic studies. Project Narrative: The goal of this proposal is to use cutting edge next generation DNA sequencing to identify genetic variants contributing to recurrent stroke risk. We will evaluate two novel gene regions identified in the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention clinical trial population. The successful completion of this project will provide insight into personalized risk assessment, targeted prevention, and response to treatment for stroke and recurrent stroke, ultimately reducing the huge health burdens of stroke.",Genetic evaluation of two novel loci associated with recurrent stroke,9232492,R15NS095115,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Anticoagulation ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Biotech ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' vitamin Bc ', ' Vitamin M ', ' Pteroylglutamic Acid ', ' Folate ', ' Folic Acid ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' t-PA ', ' Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator ', ' Tissue Plasminogen Activator ', ' Tissue Activator D-44 ', ' T-Plasminogen Activator ', ' Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator ', ' Alteplase ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vitamins ', ' Generations ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Vitamin B6 ', ' pyridoxine ', ' Vitamin B 6 ', ' VIT B6 ', ' Pyridoxol ', ' Pyridoxin ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Genetic ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' American ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' R15 Program ', ' R15 Mechanism ', ' Academic Research Enhancement Awards ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' minority health ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' Genetic study ', ' sequencing platform ', ' phenotypic data ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' ']",NINDS,EAST CAROLINA UNIVERSITY,R15,2016,442372,0.3900135085517577
"Left Atrial abNormality, ThromboEmbolism, and Race: Novel risk factors for stroke (LANTERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  African Americans face a two-fold higher risk of ischemic stroke than white residents of the U.S. The reasons for this black-white stroke disparity are not completely known. This proposal seeks to identify whether atrial cardiopathy, a novel risk factor, partly explains the higher stroke risk in blacks. Compared to whites, blacks experience less atrial fibrillation, a heart-rhythm disorder that is one of the strongest known risk factors for stroke. In the prevailing clinical paradigm, it is thought that atrial fibrillation is required for blood clots to form in the heart's left atrium, from where they can embolize to the brain and cause stroke. However, recent research indicates that embolization from the left atrium can occur when there are abnormalities in atrial tissue and function—a condition referred to as atrial cardiopathy—regardless of whether there is atrial fibrillation. Preliminary data suggest that atrial cardiopathy manifests differently in blacks than whites: more often with left atrial abnormality on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and less often with atrial fibrillation or its typical accompaniment, left atrial enlargement on an echocardiogram. As a result, atrial thromboembolism may often go unrecognized in blacks because it occurs in the absence of atrial fibrillation and atrial enlargement. The proposed research will test the central hypothesis that currently unexplained disparities in stroke between whites and blacks can be partly explained by differences in the manifestation of atrial cardiopathy. This application is for an ancillary study to the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study and the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study (GCNKSS). REGARDS is a longitudinal cohort study that seeks to shed light on the relationship between baseline risk factors and future stroke in >30,000 black and white individuals. GCNKSS is a population-based epidemiological study of racial disparities in the incidence and outcomes of stroke in a biracial population of 1.3 million. Taking advantage of the complementary designs of these studies, the proposed research will first determine the relationship between baseline ECG-defined left atrial abnormality, race, and future stroke in REGARDS. It will then determine black-white differences in GCNKSS in markers that signify a potential atrial thromboembolic cause of stroke. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypotheses that blacks have a higher prevalence of left atrial abnormality, that left atrial abnormality is associated with future stroke, and that left atrial abnormality contributes to the higher stroke risk in blacks. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypotheses that black patients with ischemic stroke more often have ECG-defined left atrial abnormality and less often have echocardiographic left atrial enlargement than whites. All ECGs and a subset of echocardiogram images will be centrally interpreted. This research promises to show that blacks' higher stroke risk partly reflects actionable differences in the biology of stroke. Such findings may ultimately lead to therapy using existing medications approved for atrial fibrillation. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of novel and treatable cardiac risk factors for stroke will ultimately improve risk factor screening and stroke prevention efforts, thereby reducing the incidence of a disabling and lethal disease. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NINDS's mission that involves reducing the burden of neurological disease by fostering research on the causes and prevention of stroke. The proposed research also addresses NINDS' top priority for future directions of stroke epidemiology research, which is to improve the understanding of race and ethnic stroke disparities.","Left Atrial abNormality, ThromboEmbolism, and Race: Novel risk factors for stroke (LANTERN)",9156264,R01NS097443,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' blood thinner ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Clotting ', ' Blood coagulation ', ' Body Surface Area ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Dilatation ', ' Dilatation - action ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' heart sonography ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' embolization ', ' Embolotherapy ', ' Embolization Therapy ', ' Therapeutic Embolization ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Future ', ' Heart ', ' atrium ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Hypertrophy ', ' Incidence ', ' Kentucky ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mission ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Thromboembolism ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Left Atrium ', ' Left atrial structure ', ' cardiac rhythm ', ' heart rhythm ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Cardiac ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' biracial ', ' black/white disparity ', ' ']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2016,432045,0.48644934031422177
"Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mexican Americans are the most numerous sub-group of Hispanic Americans, the largest minority population in the United States. This important group is aging and growing rapidly. For the past 14 years the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project has provided rich original stroke disparities research comparing Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. BASIC remains the only means to monitor stroke trends and to investigate stroke outcomes in Mexican Americans. BASIC has demonstrated that stroke incidence is higher in Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites. New stroke incidence data from BASIC show that the disparity remains completely unabated over the last decade. Further, stroke onset occurs at younger ages in Mexican Americans providing more years of disability. This contributes to a substantial increased cost for stroke in Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites. Remarkable new data from BASIC suggests that the previously seen Mexican American survival advantage post-stroke is disappearing. Further, Mexican American stroke survivors have worse neurologic and functional outcomes. Thus, BASIC data suggests that in 2013 Mexican Americans have more strokes, occurring at younger ages, and experience far greater post- stroke disability than non-Hispanic whites. The current proposal seeks to continue to provide rigorous stroke surveillance to monitor stroke trends in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We further propose to provide new longer-term (six month and one year) stroke outcome data to provide crucial information on the time course and changes in neurologic, functional, cognitive, and quality of life outcomes post-stroke in both ethnic groups. Additionally, since post-stroke disability appears much worse in Mexican Americans, we plan to delve deeply into the structure of informal caregiving post-stroke and understand the needs of stroke survivors and the role of families in addressing these needs. This data on the social/family context in which stroke survivors function will be crucial for designing intervention to improve stroke outcome. Finally, the definition of stroke will be studied to understand the impact on measures of stroke burden derived from an ethnically diverse population-based study. BASIC has published over 55 original, peer-reviewed manuscripts, spun-off 5 R-level grants and served as the foundation for training numerous diverse students. In this next cycle, we are poised and deeply committed to provide a fundamental understanding of long-term stroke trends, outcome studies, and informal caregiving structure, as well as continuing to provide key clinical observations such as the impact of the new stroke definition. This work is absolutely critical to Mexican Americans, a growing, aging and large minority population that will increasingly feel the impact from stroke in the next decade. Indeed, this work is also critical to clinicians and public health planners as BASIC continues to offer key observations on stroke and Mexican American health disparities.

"The University of Iowa's Statewide Stroke Research Network DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of lowa (Ul) Statewide Stroke Research Network meets the goal of the NINDS Stroke Trials Network of maximizing efficiencies in developing, promoting, and conducting high quality multi-site clinical trials on stroke prevention, treatment, and recovery. The current proposal builds on the rich tradition of the Ul as a leader in both developing and conducting NINDS-sponsored research, as well as on the Ul's role as the hub of a new integrated health care network - The Ul Health Alliance. The long-term goals of this proposal are to improve the efficiency of conducting Phase I - III stroke trials and to ensure a robust pipeline of well-trained clinical investigators to lead such trials. he proposal's immediate goal is to establish an expanded statewide research network for conducting stroke trials that reaches underserved rural patients who currently are unable to participate in stroke trials due to geographical barriers and who are subject to disparities in health outcomes. The proposed University of lowa Regional Coordinating Center (UIRCC) represents a comprehensive and integrated infrastructure for conducting trials that brings together healthcare providers, hospital administrators, clinical and health service investigators, public health officials, and patient advocates. The UIRCC comprises a network that expands the research capabilities of the Ul to 12 trial-ready sites. Those hospitals will be supplied by a statewide infrastructure of spokes that will allow adequate representation in trials of those Americans first evaluated at critical access hospitals. The UIRCC will capitalize on prior work by the PI to improve recruitment of patients presenting to critical access hospitals and maximize geographic access of patients. The feasibility of this approach is supported by the ongoing research data sharing collaboration, and a strong institutional support from the statewide healthcare alliance. We have plans already in place to expand this statewide network model to Nebraska and to the Dakotas. The UIRCC will also develop innovative translational research proposals that will lead to multicenter clinical trials through the NINDS stroke network by bringing together clinicians, early stage (i.e., bench to bedside) translational investigators, clinical trialists, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and geographers to develop proposals of new approaches to stroke treatment, recovery, and prevention that utilize innovative methods (e.g., adaptive and pragmatic trial designs), and that focuses on the special needs of rural patients. We are particularly interested in trials testing promising therapies to augment recovery after stroke; as such treatments may have a large public health impact.

"Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/Intervention Research Program in Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Los Angeles Stroke Prevention/ Intervention Research Program in Health Disparities is a partnership of UCLA, four medical centers in the Los Angeles County safety net system, Healthy African American Families, and representatives from multiple community organizations serving low-income minority communities that span the Los Angeles basin. In this most diverse county in the US in race/ethnicity, we propose a multi-disciplinary, highly collaborative Program to create and test sustainable interventions to reduce or eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in the occurrence of stroke, and to generate new knowledge about mechanisms for such disparities. Project I creates a strong community-based component with community health workers and mobile health technology to create a full-fledged Chronic Care Model intervention that will be tested relative to usual care in 500 patients with a recent stroke seen in the Los Angeles County safety net. A cost analysis and a formative evaluation will guide development of a financial sustainability plan. Project II will elucidate the role of novel biological and social risk factors for stroke risk and trends over time, in a nationa data set. Project III builds on an existing close partnership with the City of Los Angeles Department of Aging to develop and test a culturally-tailored behavioral stroke risk factor reduction/walking intervention - delivered by senior center staff-with 240 high risk seniors from Korean, Chinese, African-American and Hispanic racial/ethnic groups. Four cores include an Administrative Core A that supports all three projects; a Research Education and Training Core B that will recruit, retain, and develop stroke disparities-relevant curriculum for academic researchers, community research support personnel and other community stake holders; a Biomarker Collection and Analysis Core C to support Project I and III biomarker data collection, consulting for all three projects, and development of educational programming on biomarkers; and a Community Engagement, Outreach, and Dissemination Core D that supports and interacts with all three projects by promoting and sustaining community-academic partnerships through bidirectional knowledge sharing and by creating strategies for disseminating advances in knowledge about stroke prevention disparities research through outreach to affected communities locally and nationally.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A coordinated effort of researchers and community partners is needed to reduce or eliminate the higher rates of stroke among low-income Latinos, African-Americans, and Asian Americans in underserved communities.

"YoungStroke 2016 PROJECT ABSTRACT Thirty percent of individuals with stroke are under the age of 65 years. This number is projected to increase dramatically in the coming decades due to improved survival at the acute stage. Due to health disparities, younger stroke survivors have poorer access to physician care, lower medication affordability, and prolonged disability compared with older stroke survivors. Collectively, these factors contribute to the rising economic burden of stroke in America. YoungStroke is the first and only American advocacy organization formed to specifically address the unmet needs of young adult stroke survivors and their caregivers. It is a 501(c)3 nonprofit advocacy organization with a three-fold mission to (1) educate the public about the increasing prevalence of stroke among young adults and its devastating impact upon community life; (2) advocate for increased awareness and research about stroke in young adults and methods for prevention; and (3) change the status quo by creating a forum for innovative and viable solutions to the unique challenges faced by young stroke survivors. The objective of YoungStroke 2016 is to provide a high quality scientific forum to exchange information on risk factors and prevalence, treatment, and long-term care and survivorship of young adults with stroke, by bringing together the survivors, their caregivers and stroke researchers from around the world on the same platform. Its agenda and format directly align with participant feedback from the successful inaugural YoungStroke 2015 conference held in Jacksonville, Florida from June 27-29, 2015. YoungStroke 2016 again returns to Jacksonville, Florida – strategically within the Stroke Belt region hosting America’s highest stroke mortality and morbidity. The specific objectives of the conference are to: (1) Identify the risk factors and prevalence of young stroke to create strategies for prevention, early diagnosis and treatment; (2) Exchange information on programs from around the world to enhance post-acute and chronic management of stroke survivorship and reduce the burden of complications and disability. At the conclusion of the conference, the discussions will be summarized as white papers for public dissemination, and researchers will form collaborative teams to develop clinical research projects to test the effectiveness of the solutions proposed on primary, secondary and tertiary care prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. with a growing population of young adult stroke survivors aged less than 65 years. The pressing needs of this population are both unique and unmet. The objective of the “YoungStroke 2016” conference is to provide a high quality scientific forum to exchange information on risk factors, prevalence, treatment, and long-term survivorship of young adults with stroke, by bringing together the survivors, their caregivers and stroke researchers from around the world on the same platform.",YoungStroke 2016,9260252,R13NS101706,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Americas ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Awareness ', ' Canada ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Consultations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Europe ', ' Exercise ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Florida ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' Paper ', ' Physicians ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Workers ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Walkers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Series ', ' Survivors ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Staging ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Future Generations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Long Term Survivorship ', ' Modification ', ' community living ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' tertiary care ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' disability burden ', ' collaborative environment ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' stroke survivor ', ' ']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R13,2016,5000,0.3604193193369741
"A Community Based Participatory Trial to Increase Stroke Treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-stroke disability represents a significant public health problem. Currently, there are over 7 million stroke survivors in the US, most of whom have persistent disability. Despite the fact that acute stroke treatments dramatically reduce post-stroke disability and are cost saving, they are markedly underutilized. There is no region in the US where acute stroke treatments are more underutilized than in Flint, Michigan. Flint is an urban, underserved city with nearly 100,000 residents of whom about 60% are African American. One of the main reasons for acute stroke treatment underutilization is pre-hospital delay-patients arrive to the hospital too late to receive the treatment. For the past 6 years, the Community Health Partnership-composed of academic partners from the University of Michigan and community partners, Bridges into the Future-has worked to increase acute stroke treatment rates in Flint by decreasing pre-hospital delay. The Community Health Partnership completed several community needs assessments, and from those designed and tested a peer-led, health behavior theory-based intervention in African American churches. The intervention focused on increasing stroke preparedness (i.e., increasing community member's recognition of stroke warning signs and the importance of calling 911 immediately for stroke). This community intervention, Stroke Ready, successfully increased stroke preparedness. The current application represents the larger scale adaption and testing of the Stroke Ready intervention to increase the Flint community's acute stroke treatment rates. Stroke Ready, now expanded to a multi-level intervention, aims to increase acute stroke treatment through both community stroke preparedness and Emergency Department readiness. The Stroke Ready community intervention will adapt and expand the Stroke Ready pilot intervention consisting of interactive workshops and a stroke music video to newly include community-wide education activities such as social media and mass print media. We will also collaborate with a Flint safety-net hospital, where the majority of stroke patients are African American that is in great need of improved acute stroke care, to optimize treatment pathways. The primary outcome of the project will be change in acute stroke treatments, which will directly benefit the entire community by reducing post-stroke disability. Sustainability will be achieved in Flint by training of peer-leaders, wide dissemination of Stroke Ready materials, ease of administering the intervention, hospital improvements and continued commitment and engagement of the Community Advisory Board. The products of this application include a strategy to improve acute stroke treatments in safety-net hospitals and the easy to deliver Stroke Ready community intervention to allow for sustainability and dissemination.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If acute stroke treatments are given soon after the start of a stroke, they can reduce the chance that stroke survivors are left with disability. Yet few stroke patients, particularly African Americans, receive these treatments. In this project, community and academic researchers will work together to increase the number of patients who receive acute stroke treatments in the predominately African American community of Flint, Michigan.        ",A Community Based Participatory Trial to Increase Stroke Treatment,9129195,U01MD010579,"['lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Michigan ', ' Music ', ' Patients ', ' Printed Media ', ' Public Health ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Acute ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Relative Risks ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Church ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' safety net ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' 911 call ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' social media ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke symptom ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2016,538950,0.45767615548086965

"The Discovering Healthcare Innovations to Address Disparties in Stroke (DIADS) pr     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans experience the highest rates of stroke of all race/ethnic groups In the US. Stroke in African American occurs at younger ages than Caucasians. While racial disparities in stroke exist at all ages, disparities are greatest in young adulthood. Temporal trend data suggest that these stroke disparities in young adulthood may be widening. Hypertension is the most common and potent risk factor for stroke in the US. Blood pressure (BP) control rates are known to differ by race and may be an important contributor to racial disparities in stroke. Disparities in blood pressure control are most prominent in younger adulthood, further contributing to disparities in stroke rates in this age group. Efforts aimed at the primary prevention of stroke have generally not focused on young adulthood, despite the greatest disparities in incident disease being observed in this period and the opportunity for long-term risk reduction via interventions targeted early in adulthood. Effective intervention targeting known stroke risk factors (e.g. hypertension) have not been developed for young adults. Additionally the literature on novel risk factors present in young adulthood that may be amenable to additional risk reduction is currently lacking. DIADS is collaboration between Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). DIADS seeks to design, implement, and evaluate a clinically-delivered hypertension control intervention that consists of both a clinical algorithm for rapid an effective blood BP control, as well as a culturally-tailored dietary Intervention aimed at more effective sustained BP control. Specific Aim 1: To conduct a cluster pragmatic randomized trial of a clinically-delivered hypertension control intervention (Shake, Rattle, and Roll) that will consist of a clinical algorithm for rapid and sustained blood pressure control, as well as a culturally tailored dietary intervention. Specific Aim 2: To conduct an observational cohort study of children, adolescents, and young adults within KPNC to identify temporal trends in traditional risk factors for stroke in the young, as well as novel factors that may Increase stroke risk in thi age group. Specific Aim 3: To implement the essential components of the Shake, Rattle, and Roll hypertension control intervention in a local community clinic serving a diverse population and then disseminate the intervention among a broad coalition of community clinics in Alameda County and San Francisco County.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood pressure control rates are known to differ by race and are likely be an important contributor to racial disparities in stroke, particularly for young Afrian American adults in whom a disturbing increase in stroke rates has occurred in recent years.

"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.                ",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9028400,R01HL126700,"['abstracting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Apnea ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Elements ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sleep-related breathing disorder ', ' Sleep-Disordered Breathing ', ' Sleep Hypopnea ', ' Sleep Apnea ', ' Sleep Apnea Syndromes ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' Pulse Rates ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Funding ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Autonomic Dysfunction ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Stratification ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' surveillance study ', ' screening ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' stroke survivor ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,767518,0.4811929638256092
"Outcomes Among Surrogate decision makers In Stroke (OASIS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every day in hospitals across the country, patients with severe stroke and their families are faced with decisions about life-sustaining treatments in the initial hours of admission. These decisions about resuscitation status, invasive treatments, or possible transitions to comfort care are typically made by a surrogate decision- maker due to communication or cognitive deficits in the patient. This surrogate must consider the patient's life goals and values to determine if their loved one would choose on-going intensive treatments where they may survive and yet have long term disabilities, or prioritize comfort and accept the likelihood of an earlier death. Serving as a surrogate decision maker for a patient in the intensive care unit can have long lasting negative consequences. However, almost nothing is known about surrogate decision makers in diverse populations with stroke. Hispanic Americans are now the largest minority group in the US, rapidly growing and aging, with Mexican Americans comprising the largest subgroup. Multiple disparities have been identified in stroke incidence and outcome between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites, particularly in the use of life- sustaining treatments. Minority populations may be particularly vulnerable to inadequate communication about end-of-life issues due to socioeconomic disadvantage, poor health literacy, and lack of provider empathy and health system strategies to improve communication. However, Mexican American culture includes strong values of family support and religiosity that may have a positive influence on discussions about life-sustaining treatment and adapting to stroke-related disabilities. There is currently a critical gap in understanding the perspectives and outcomes of stroke surrogate decision makers, making it impossible to design interventions to help diverse populations of patients and families through this incredibly trying time. The aims of this proposal are 1) To assess physician quality of communication, shared decision-making, and quality of end-of-life care among stroke surrogate decision makers; and 2) To assess the long-term impact of serving as a surrogate decision maker for stroke and assess the unmet decision support needs of stroke surrogates. Results will be used to design future targeted decision support interventions for diverse populations of stroke patients and family members. This proposal takes advantage of the extensive established infrastructure of the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS038916), a population based epidemiological stroke surveillance study recently funded for its fourth 5-year cycle. New prospectively obtained data on surrogate decision-maker outcomes using established validated measures will be linked to BASIC's rich longitudinal patient-level data on functional outcome to maximize efficiency. Leveraging the resources of this highly successful project will allow a comprehensive yet cost-effective investigation that would not otherwise be feasible to study in a prospective longitudinal cohort design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently, very little is known about the experience and outcomes of family members who make medical decisions for individuals with stroke. Results from this project will improve our understanding of the early and long-range consequences of these challenging decisions in diverse populations and help to develop specific interventions to reduce the emotional and psychological burden on family members.",Outcomes Among Surrogate decision makers In Stroke (OASIS),9313338,R01NS091112,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Aging ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Empathy ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Interview ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Minority Groups ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Palliative Care ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Regrets ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Family member ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Country ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Emotional ', ' end of life care ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Health system ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health literacy ', ' attributable death ', ' attributable mortality ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' loved ones ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' surveillance study ', ' quality of death ', ' quality of dying ', ' shared decision making ', ' surrogate decision maker ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' family support ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,458967,0.26608912840488264
"A Community Based Participatory Trial to Increase Stroke Treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-stroke disability represents a significant public health problem. Currently, there are over 7 million stroke survivors in the US, most of whom have persistent disability. Despite the fact that acute stroke treatments dramatically reduce post-stroke disability and are cost saving, they are markedly underutilized. There is no region in the US where acute stroke treatments are more underutilized than in Flint, Michigan. Flint is an urban, underserved city with nearly 100,000 residents of whom about 60% are African American. One of the main reasons for acute stroke treatment underutilization is pre-hospital delay-patients arrive to the hospital too late to receive the treatment. For the past 6 years, the Community Health Partnership-composed of academic partners from the University of Michigan and community partners, Bridges into the Future-has worked to increase acute stroke treatment rates in Flint by decreasing pre-hospital delay. The Community Health Partnership completed several community needs assessments, and from those designed and tested a peer-led, health behavior theory-based intervention in African American churches. The intervention focused on increasing stroke preparedness (i.e., increasing community member's recognition of stroke warning signs and the importance of calling 911 immediately for stroke). This community intervention, Stroke Ready, successfully increased stroke preparedness. The current application represents the larger scale adaption and testing of the Stroke Ready intervention to increase the Flint community's acute stroke treatment rates. Stroke Ready, now expanded to a multi-level intervention, aims to increase acute stroke treatment through both community stroke preparedness and Emergency Department readiness. The Stroke Ready community intervention will adapt and expand the Stroke Ready pilot intervention consisting of interactive workshops and a stroke music video to newly include community-wide education activities such as social media and mass print media. We will also collaborate with a Flint safety-net hospital, where the majority of stroke patients are African American that is in great need of improved acute stroke care, to optimize treatment pathways. The primary outcome of the project will be change in acute stroke treatments, which will directly benefit the entire community by reducing post-stroke disability. Sustainability will be achieved in Flint by training of peer-leaders, wide dissemination of Stroke Ready materials, ease of administering the intervention, hospital improvements and continued commitment and engagement of the Community Advisory Board. The products of this application include a strategy to improve acute stroke treatments in safety-net hospitals and the easy to deliver Stroke Ready community intervention to allow for sustainability and dissemination.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If acute stroke treatments are given soon after the start of a stroke, they can reduce the chance that stroke survivors are left with disability. Yet few stroke patients, particularly African Americans, receive these treatments. In this project, community and academic researchers will work together to increase the number of patients who receive acute stroke treatments in the predominately African American community of Flint, Michigan.        ",A Community Based Participatory Trial to Increase Stroke Treatment,9360570,U01MD010579,"['lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Michigan ', ' Music ', ' Patients ', ' Printed Media ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Cost Savings ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Acute ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Relative Risks ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Church ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Address ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' community intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' stroke recovery ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' safety net ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' successful intervention ', ' 911 call ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' social media ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke symptom ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' urban underserved ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2017,889996,0.45767615548086965
"Left Atrial abNormality, ThromboEmbolism, and Race: Novel risk factors for stroke (LANTERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  African Americans face a two-fold higher risk of ischemic stroke than white residents of the U.S. The reasons for this black-white stroke disparity are not completely known. This proposal seeks to identify whether atrial cardiopathy, a novel risk factor, partly explains the higher stroke risk in blacks. Compared to whites, blacks experience less atrial fibrillation, a heart-rhythm disorder that is one of the strongest known risk factors for stroke. In the prevailing clinical paradigm, it is thought that atrial fibrillation is required for blood clots to form in the heart's left atrium, from where they can embolize to the brain and cause stroke. However, recent research indicates that embolization from the left atrium can occur when there are abnormalities in atrial tissue and function—a condition referred to as atrial cardiopathy—regardless of whether there is atrial fibrillation. Preliminary data suggest that atrial cardiopathy manifests differently in blacks than whites: more often with left atrial abnormality on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and less often with atrial fibrillation or its typical accompaniment, left atrial enlargement on an echocardiogram. As a result, atrial thromboembolism may often go unrecognized in blacks because it occurs in the absence of atrial fibrillation and atrial enlargement. The proposed research will test the central hypothesis that currently unexplained disparities in stroke between whites and blacks can be partly explained by differences in the manifestation of atrial cardiopathy. This application is for an ancillary study to the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study and the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study (GCNKSS). REGARDS is a longitudinal cohort study that seeks to shed light on the relationship between baseline risk factors and future stroke in >30,000 black and white individuals. GCNKSS is a population-based epidemiological study of racial disparities in the incidence and outcomes of stroke in a biracial population of 1.3 million. Taking advantage of the complementary designs of these studies, the proposed research will first determine the relationship between baseline ECG-defined left atrial abnormality, race, and future stroke in REGARDS. It will then determine black-white differences in GCNKSS in markers that signify a potential atrial thromboembolic cause of stroke. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypotheses that blacks have a higher prevalence of left atrial abnormality, that left atrial abnormality is associated with future stroke, and that left atrial abnormality contributes to the higher stroke risk in blacks. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypotheses that black patients with ischemic stroke more often have ECG-defined left atrial abnormality and less often have echocardiographic left atrial enlargement than whites. All ECGs and a subset of echocardiogram images will be centrally interpreted. This research promises to show that blacks' higher stroke risk partly reflects actionable differences in the biology of stroke. Such findings may ultimately lead to therapy using existing medications approved for atrial fibrillation. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of novel and treatable cardiac risk factors for stroke will ultimately improve risk factor screening and stroke prevention efforts, thereby reducing the incidence of a disabling and lethal disease. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NINDS's mission that involves reducing the burden of neurological disease by fostering research on the causes and prevention of stroke. The proposed research also addresses NINDS' top priority for future directions of stroke epidemiology research, which is to improve the understanding of race and ethnic stroke disparities.","Left Atrial abNormality, ThromboEmbolism, and Race: Novel risk factors for stroke (LANTERN)",9270634,R01NS097443,"['thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' blood thinner ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Clotting ', ' Blood coagulation ', ' Body Surface Area ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Dilatation ', ' Dilatation - action ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' heart sonography ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' embolization ', ' Embolotherapy ', ' Embolization Therapy ', ' Therapeutic Embolization ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Future ', ' Heart ', ' atrium ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Hypertrophy ', ' Incidence ', ' Kentucky ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mission ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Thromboembolism ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Left Atrium ', ' Left atrial structure ', ' cardiac rhythm ', ' heart rhythm ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Modeling ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Cardiac ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' biracial ', ' black/white disparity ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' ']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2017,416998,0.48644934031422177
"Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly Stroke is a major public health problem in the United States. It is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of serious disability in adults. There are an estimated 800,000 strokes in the United States each year, with more than 4.4 million stroke survivors. Twenty percent of stroke survivors require institutional care after 3 months and 15%-30% are permanently disabled. Recurrent events, which occur in 185,000 stroke survivors in the United States each year, are associated with higher mortality rates, greater levels of disability, and increased costs as compared with first strokes. Stroke in adults is strongly age dependent, and the rate of adverse outcomes and complications associated with stroke increases with advanced age. Because the United States population is aging, the population at risk for stroke and recurrent events will increase over the coming decades. Its high prevalence and associated deficits impose a large burden on patients, their families, and the healthcare system. Optimizing post-acute care and secondary prevention efforts for stroke survivors represents an important target to reduce the burden of recurrent stroke, particularly among the elderly. Racial- ethnic and regional disparities have been identified for stroke incidence, prevalence, and morality, but relatively little research has focused on potential disparities in the patterns of recurrent stroke events. The Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly Study will use Medicare administrative data to achieve the following specific aims: 1) to determine rates of recurrent stroke in elderly Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with ischemic stroke and assess disparities in recurrent rates by geographic and sociodemographic characteristics; and 2) to identify socioeconomic, healthcare access, lifestyle/comorbidity, and post-acute care factors that may contribute to variation in recurrent stroke events. Clinical practice, public policy, and reimbursement decisions are increasingly informed by data obtained from administrative datasets. The Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly Study will be the largest contemporary investigation of recurrent stroke rates and patterns in the United States. Results from this project will identify geographic areas and subgroups that have distinctive health profiles that put them at high risk for recurrent stroke. Such information will inform care providers, insurers, public health agencies, and policy makers about communities that may derive the greatest benefit from targeted programs and community-based interventions. Results from the study will provide clinicians, investigators, and policymakers with national data on rates, trends, and patterns of recurrent stroke hospitalizations among the elderly, including variation among patient subgroups and geographic regions.",Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly,9566431,R56AG050791,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' American Heart Association ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Demographic Aging ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Resources ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Morality ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' disability ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Progress Review Group ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' beneficiary ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' national surveillance ', ' Minority ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' stroke survivor ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R56,2017,834672,0.4377547794858888
"Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mexican Americans are the most numerous sub-group of Hispanic Americans, the largest minority population in the United States. This important group is aging and growing rapidly. For the past 14 years the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project has provided rich original stroke disparities research comparing Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. BASIC remains the only means to monitor stroke trends and to investigate stroke outcomes in Mexican Americans. BASIC has demonstrated that stroke incidence is higher in Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites. New stroke incidence data from BASIC show that the disparity remains completely unabated over the last decade. Further, stroke onset occurs at younger ages in Mexican Americans providing more years of disability. This contributes to a substantial increased cost for stroke in Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites. Remarkable new data from BASIC suggests that the previously seen Mexican American survival advantage post-stroke is disappearing. Further, Mexican American stroke survivors have worse neurologic and functional outcomes. Thus, BASIC data suggests that in 2013 Mexican Americans have more strokes, occurring at younger ages, and experience far greater post- stroke disability than non-Hispanic whites. The current proposal seeks to continue to provide rigorous stroke surveillance to monitor stroke trends in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We further propose to provide new longer-term (six month and one year) stroke outcome data to provide crucial information on the time course and changes in neurologic, functional, cognitive, and quality of life outcomes post-stroke in both ethnic groups. Additionally, since post-stroke disability appears much worse in Mexican Americans, we plan to delve deeply into the structure of informal caregiving post-stroke and understand the needs of stroke survivors and the role of families in addressing these needs. This data on the social/family context in which stroke survivors function will be crucial for designing intervention to improve stroke outcome. Finally, the definition of stroke will be studied to understand the impact on measures of stroke burden derived from an ethnically diverse population-based study. BASIC has published over 55 original, peer-reviewed manuscripts, spun-off 5 R-level grants and served as the foundation for training numerous diverse students. In this next cycle, we are poised and deeply committed to provide a fundamental understanding of long-term stroke trends, outcome studies, and informal caregiving structure, as well as continuing to provide key clinical observations such as the impact of the new stroke definition. This work is absolutely critical to Mexican Americans, a growing, aging and large minority population that will increasingly feel the impact from stroke in the next decade. Indeed, this work is also critical to clinicians and public health planners as BASIC continues to offer key observations on stroke and Mexican American health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to monitor and understand the tremendous stroke disparity among Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Stroke incidence, recurrence, mortality, and, in survivors, neurologic, functional and cognitive outcomes will be compared among the ethnic groups. Informal caregiving structure will be studied to improve services and tailor interventions for stroke survivors and families to improve stroke outcome and prevent second stroke.",Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project,9242078,R01NS038916,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Incidence ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Survivors ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' stroke recovery ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' informal caregiving ', ' Informal care giving ', ' stroke survivor ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' stroke intervention ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,763825,0.35564741078733175
"Racial Disparities, Influenza Like Illness and the Association between Short-term Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Outcomes Heart Disease is the leading cause of death in the US, with approximately 735,000 myocardial infarction (MI) events per year. Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the US and the number one cause of long-­term adult disability with nearly 800,000 stroke events in the US each year. The reduction of risk factors for stroke and heart disease has become a high priority, with policy efforts implementing risk reduction efforts. Novel risk factors such as inflammation and infection, including influenza like illness (ILI), or environmental exposures, such as air pollution, are known to be risk factors for MI and stroke. Moreover, ambient air pollution increases the risk of ILI, suggesting the potential for air pollution triggering an ILI event, which then subsequently triggers a stroke or MI event. Racial disparities are highly prevalent in not only the levels of air pollution, but also in the health effects of air pollution, as well as having a major role in the risk of ILI, stroke and MI. Racial and ethnic minorities are at higher risk to be exposed to high levels of air pollution, and are t higher risk for infections, stroke and MI. While the relationships between air pollution/cardiovascular disease and air pollution/ILI have been independently recognized, the combined relationship between air pollution, ILI and subsequent cardiovascular events, and how racial disparities influence this relationship has not yet been investigated. To overcome the current barriers to knowledge, this application aims to (1) determine the effect racial disparities has on the relationship ILI has on the association between air pollution and MI (2) determine the effect racial disparities has on the relationship ILI has on the association between air pollution and stroke, and (3) identify the populations at greatest risk for having an MI or stroke due to the combined effects of air pollution and ILI. Furthermore, no study has addressed these relationships in a large scale, generalizable dataset that allows for exploration of geographical, urban/rural, or differences across biologically relevant variables, such as sex and age, that could further influence these relationships. We will use two separate, large-­scale administrative datasets to assess these relationships. The analyses will be conducted in the MarketScan dataset first, and then replicated in the SPARCS dataset. MarketScan is an administrative dataset with nearly 230 million de-­identified patients with longitudinal information on patient demographics, including residential metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and 3-­digit zipcode, and ICD-­9 codes (pre-­2015) or ICD-­10 codes (post-­2015) diagnosis and procedure codes for all inpatient and outpatient visits linked by a de-­identified patient identifier code. The analyses will then be replicated in the New York Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) dataset, a comprehensive data reporting system that collects information on hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits within the state of New York with detailed information on patient characteristics, demographics and diagnoses. The innovation of this idea is identifying at risk groups as defined by air pollution status and ILI as opposed to traditional risk factors. The overall goal of this project is to investigate racial disparities in the association between air pollution, influenza like illness and subsequent stroke and myocardial infarction. The proposed research will use data from two administrative claims databases, MarketScan and the New York Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) dataset. The proposed NIMHD Health Services Research on Minority Health and Health Disparities Grant Application (R21) will answer important questions regarding the racial disparities in the association between air pollution on influenza like illness, and how this relates to stroke or myocardial infarction risk.      ","Racial Disparities, Influenza Like Illness and the Association between Short-term Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Outcomes",9471050,R21MD012451,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Influenza ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza virus vaccine ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' Flu vaccine ', ' Inpatients ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' New York ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Respiratory Tract Infections ', ' Respiratory Infections ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Procedures ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Rural ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' metropolitan ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) ', ' ICD-10 ', ' ICD-9 ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' modifiable risk ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' racial minority ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NIMHD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2017,240000,0.29580487768904007
"HISPANIC SECONDARY STROKE PREVENTION INITIATIVE DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the main preventable cause of adult disability in the US. Stroke also disproportionately impacts the Hispanic population whose rapid growth and aging will lead to dramatic future increases in the public health impact of stroke. In the Hispanic Secondary Stroke Prevention Initiative we propose a translational research project aimed at reducing the risk for a recurrent stroke. Our focus is on patients having had a stroke since they have over a 25% risk of a recurrent and potentially much more debilitating stroke in the next five years. Our team is currently pursuing two important lines of research aimed at rigorously testing interventions to address disparities in a variety of other health conditions. On is Community Health Workers (CHW), a highly promising approach, for which evidence from RCTs is limited. Our group is also testing mobile health solutions among minorities. We propose to extend this work through a combined CHW/ ProMobile intervention. The study design will be a pragmatic clinical trial of 300 Latino patients in our stroke registry admitted with an acute ischemic stroke and having a moderate disability or less at time of discharge. The intervention will include CHW home visits, coaching phone calls, and group sessions. Cell phone based interactions will include blood pressure monitoring and tailored education messages. We will determine if the proposed intervention results in improving the most important recurrent stroke risk factor which is systolic blood pressure. We will also examine other risk factors including cholesterol, medication adherence, and among diabetic patients, glycemic control. A strength of our study is that it will leverage existing resources, including those of our recently funded strok disparities program and our CTSA. We expect that our translational research project will provide new insights on potential approaches to treatment that can transform medical practice to improve health outcomes in Latino stroke populations. Stroke is a leading cause of death and functional impairments. Stroke also disproportionately affects Latino populations.

"Examining Racial Disparities in Stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the 4th leading cause of US mortality and 3rd among African Americans, with African Americans exhibiting more than twice the risk of Whites. The underlying causes of racial disparities in stroke are unclear. Few studies have systematically evaluated how racial disparities in stroke might vary by socioeconomic and behavior risk factors (e.g. measures of socioeconomic status [SES], adiposity, physical activity and alcohol) and they might explain the observed disparities through their roles as intermediates in the causal pathway between race and stroke. There has been a paucity of research on the impact of socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors in stroke risk prediction. Moreover, validation of existing stroke prediction scores among African Americans is urgently needed. This innovative project will address these gaps in the literature by: (1) determining whether racial disparities in stroke and the associations of selected stroke risk factors by race are comparable in two biracial socioeconomically heterogeneous populations, (2) determining whether mediation by socioeconomic and behavioral stroke risk factors account for racial disparities in stroke beyond traditional stroke risk factors using conventional and causal frameworks, and (3) examining whether race-specific stroke prediction models improve the predictive performance (calibration and discrimination) of long-term stroke risk compared to existing stroke prediction models. These aims will be accomplished through the use of three multi-racial, well-established NIH-funded cohorts; the Women's Health Initiative, Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) and Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke.  A comprehensive approach to examining racial disparities will be utilized. Novel causal mediation analyses will complement conventional epidemiologic methods and move the field forward. Furthermore, race-specific stroke prediction models will enable the development of improved prevention strategies among at-risk individuals. These socioeconomic and behavioral stroke risk factors are often routinely collected in the clinic or could be obtained at minimal cost. This grant will generate new knowledge and crucial training for my advancement to become an independent epidemiologist in the field of racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) by developing my expertise in (1) racial disparities and social determinant of CVD; (2) statistical training in mediation analyses; (3) methodologic training in prediction modeling; (4) data management and analytic skills with Medicare claims data (CMS) for stroke ascertainment in SCCS and (5) pilot medical record collection for stroke validation in SCCS. The advanced training, mentorship and protected time provided by this career development award will provide the skills and experience necessary for conducting the highest quality racial/ethnic cardiovascular disparities research and a strong foundation for success as an independent epidemiologic racial/disparities investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the 4th leading cause of US mortality and 3rd among African Americans, with African Americans exhibiting more than twice the risk of Whites. This proposal will increase our understanding of differences in risk of stroke by race, providing insight into new approaches for prevention and elimination of racial disparities in stroke. By examining the contribution of socioeconomic and behavioral stroke risk factors (measures of SES, adiposity, physical activity and alcohol) to racial disparities in stroke, this proposal will advance knowledge and suggest target areas to decrease disparities, while the limitations of existing prediction scores will be addressed by the development of race-specific risk models which may assist in prevention strategies.",Examining Racial Disparities in Stroke,9292369,K01HL124391,"['Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Calibration ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' systolic hypertension ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Smoking History ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' Data Analytics ', ' biracial ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2017,178200,0.4368614940776495
"Stroke Counseling for Risk Reduction in Young Adult African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strokes have increased among young adults, and African Americans have a greater prevalence of stroke risk factors than other racial/ethnic groups, a higher incidence of early-onset stroke and more severe stroke-related outcomes. The majority of strokes could be prevented if people recognized their personal risk factors and took steps to reduce their risks. However, many young African American adults do not perceive stroke as a threat. Thus, effective interventions are needed to improve these young African Americans awareness of stroke risk and increase their risk reduction behaviors. The purpose of this mentored research scientist development application is for the investigator to gain a foundation for an independent career focused on primary stroke prevention programs for African Americans. The immediate goals of the investigator are to gain the knowledge and skills needed to (1) design and refine sustainable, theory-based stroke risk assessment counseling and behavior change interventions for at-risk African Americans; (2) implement culturally sensitive behavioral interventions for stroke prevention; and (3) evaluate stroke interventions, including assessment of fidelity and use of advanced statistical methods. To accomplish these training goals and provide a foundation for a productive research career, the investigator will conduct a two-group randomized controlled trial of 116 at-risk African Americans aged 25 to 30 years to evaluate the investigator's Stroke COunseling for Risk REduction (SCORRE) intervention, which personalizes stroke information using age-and culturally relevant video vignettes of stroke champions (e.g., young, inspiring African American stroke survivors) and the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 (LS7) web-based, global risk assessment and education tool. The aims of the proposed research are to (1) test the efficacy of the SCORRE intervention in improving accuracy of perceived stroke risk and increasing targeted risk reduction behaviors (i.e., physical activity, healthy diet, and smoking cessation), and (2) explore theoretical variabls (i.e., knowledge of stroke risk factors, motivation to change behaviors, self-efficacy for behavior change, and readiness for behavior change) and their relationships to increases and adherence to risk reduction behaviors. The results of the proposed study will inform a larger efficacy trial with a longer follow-up to determine the sustainability of the intervention effects. This research will address major stroke disparities by targeting African Americans early in life to reduce stroke risk through personalized stroke information and interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rise of stroke in young adults, the dramatic burden of stroke for African Americans, and current policies designed to strengthen primary care in the United States, provide an opportunity to expand primary stroke prevention efforts. Personalizing stroke risk information for young adult African Americans may result in greater awareness of risk and behavior changes that could reduce their chances of stroke in the future.            ",Stroke Counseling for Risk Reduction in Young Adult African Americans,9314290,K01NR015494,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Awareness ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mentors ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Mission ', ' Motivation ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Perception ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' good diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' behavior change ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' early onset ', ' post intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' modifiable risk ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke intervention ', ' ']",NINR,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,92610,0.4613918482587432
"Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to continue our population-based study of stroke incidence and case fatality, prevalence of risk factors, stroke treatment, and post-stroke outcomes within a biracial metropolitan population of 1,368,604 of whom 223,417 (16.3%) are of black race (US Census 2010). The proposed work will involve an anticipated ~3,750 patients with 4,250 strokes and/or transient ischemic attacks from our region in 2014/2015, an estimated ~600 recurrent strokes from 2015-2018 (following all strokes and transient ischemic attacks for 3 years after the original 2014/2015 event), as well as 2,000 survey participants.  For almost 20 years, we have studied trends in stroke incidence and case fatality and have demonstrated a racial disparity where stroke incidence in African-Americans is more than double that of whites. In each prior study period, we have also examined the prevalence of risk factors (and knowledge of stroke) via a population survey in order to put our temporal trend findings into context.  In addition to continuing these important activities, we seek to examine stroke recurrence in a population- based fashion (which has not been done since the 1990's) with the goal of identifying whether there is a racial disparity in stroke recurrence. We propose an innovative pilot study to determine if we can estimate functional outcome and place of residence at 3- and 6-months post-stroke without patient contact, using a local health- information exchange (HIE) and electronic health record. We will compare our estimate to phone interviews with the subject as the ""gold standard""; the phone interview to be used was successfully piloted in the current period. Finally, we have used our data to inform eligibility for stroke clinical trils. We propose to share our data with the scientific community for this purpose. In our proposed work, we will have data regarding acute stroke presentation and will add information about stroke recurrence and post-stroke functional outcomes that can be used for rational planning of stroke interventions in all phases of stroke (acute, secondary prevention, recovery).  In all of th proposed activities, the use of the HIE will make the proposed work possible (harnessing the power of centralized health data) and will be important for accomplishing the work efficiently. Overall, our proposed study will accomplish more than prior periods in a shorter time and without increased cost. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The change in stroke occurrence and recurrence over time is the ultimate test of how well science has translated new discoveries into benefits for the population. Our study has examined racial disparities in stroke over the last 20 years, showing that blacks have higher risk for stroke than whites.

"Metabolomic predictors of stroke in REGARDS Abstract There is a disproportionate burden of stroke among African Americans (AA) and individuals in the Southeastern United States, although the environmental and/or genetic underpinnings remain incompletely defined. Because metabolites integrate both environmental and genetic factors, they serve as proximal markers of human disease. In prior work supported by a Career Development Award, we established a rapid, multifunctional metabolomics platform that can be applied to large epidemiological cohorts. We now seek to focus our study on the metabolite predictors of cerebrovascular disease, an area that has received relatively little attention. To address these gaps in knowledge, we propose conducting metabolomics in stroke in the multiethnic REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke ( REGARDS) study, with further replication in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) and Framingham Heart Study (FHS). We will test the overarching hypothesis that metabolomics in well-phenotyped populations will illuminate stroke-associated metabolite pathways, and unravel racial differences among them. In Aim 1, we will identify metabolite risk factors for incident stroke, stratified by subtype, in the case-control cohort of the REGARDS study. We will profile metabolites from the baseline examination in ~1200 incident stroke cases and ~1200 controls matched for age, sex and race. In Aim 2, we will identify novel metabolite markers of known clinical risk traits for stroke, including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diet and exercise. In Aim 3, we will validate novel metabolite predictors of incident stroke and associated risk traits in the JHS and FHS cohorts. We will also test whether genetic variants that determine metabolite levels are in turn associated with clinical traits, through genetic risk score analysis. With extensive study data, the REGARDS study is uniquely positioned to catalyze the Aims of this proposal. Leveraging a novel small molecule profiling platform, our preliminary studies demonstrate the feasibility and significance of the Aims. Our multidisciplinary collaboration includes investigators at the MGH, UAB and University of Cincinnati, who bring collective expertise in metabolite profiling, biomarkers, genetic and population epidemiology, bioinformatics, metabolic traits, and health disparities. Finally, all data will be made publicly available, producing a unique scientific resource for the stroke research community. Narrative There are geographic and racial disparities in the burden of stroke across the United States. In this proposal, we will apply novel metabolite profiling techniques developed by our group to test the hypothesis that metabolomics will illuminate stroke-associated markers and unravel racial differences in that risk. These efforts have the potential to improve our ability to identify individuals at risk for stroke and improve the understanding of underlying mechanisms of disease.",Metabolomic predictors of stroke

"Health Disparities in Sepsis as a Risk Factor for Stroke Project Summary Description: Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the US and the number one cause of severe long- term adult disability. In addition to initiatives dedicated to reducing morbidity and mortality associated with stroke outcomes, there are initiatives to reduce stroke risk factors at the community level. In order to reduce the burden of stroke on the population, identifying modifiable risk factors, and demonstrating the reduction of stroke risk through risk reduction efforts is a high priority. While much is known about long-term stroke risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerotic disease, much less is known about short-term risk factors, or triggers, for stroke. Infection, particularly severe infection, has been identified as a potential risk factor and trigger for stroke. The role of sepsis as a risk factor for stroke has not been well described. Our recent analyses of administrative datasets has identified sepsis as a risk factor for stroke, however, while there is a low absolute risk of stroke post sepsis, those who are at risk remain at risk up to a year after their sepsis event. Additionally, racial disparities in sepsis and stroke have been identified, with black patients twice as likely to develop sepsis or stroke as white patients. Prior research has found that even while adjusting for poverty or medically underserved areas, black patients remain at higher risk of both sepsis and stroke, indicating a link between racial and geographic disparities with sepsis and stroke. The role racial and geographic disparities play in the relationship between sepsis and subsequent risk of stroke is not well- understood. The overall goal of this project is to investigate sepsis as a risk factor for stroke and identify risk factors of sepsis patients that increase their risk of stroke. The proposed research will use data from the REGARDS study (2003-ongoing), a unique longitudinal, nationally representative sample of people with detailed information on prior stroke comorbidities, post-stroke comorbidities and long-term outcomes. Furthermore, an ancillary REGARDS study investigated sepsis hospitalizations, providing valuable information on sepsis hospitalizations that can be investigated as risk factors for stroke. Individual and community level characteristics will be investigated, as well as potential interactions that increase the risk post-sepsis for stroke. The proposed NINDS Small Research Grant will allow us to investigate the role of sepsis as a risk factor for stroke, and identify characteristics of sepsis patients at greatest risk for a stroke, which can aide in patient selection for future research on decreasing the risk of stroke post sepsis in at risk individuals. Project Narrative The overall goal of this project is to investigate the role of sepsis as a risk factor or trigger for stroke. The proposed research will use data from the REGARDS study and the REGARDS ancillary sepsis study (2003- ongoing, N=1,416), a unique longitudinal, nationally representative sample of people with detailed information on prior stroke comorbidities, post-stroke comorbidities and long-term outcomes.

The central theme of our program is risk factor control among Hispanics at risk of stroke. In project I, we will assess in a randomized trial the effectiveness o an innovative secondary stroke prevention intervention program to improve the control of risk factors, uses a health care delivery model that has been successful for chronic disease management in minority communities, integrates pharmacists in the enhancement of adherence, and state of the art mobile information technology. In project II, we will systematically evaluate the determinants of blood pressure variability and glucose control among high-risk Hispanic family members of stroke patients. We will assess novel psychosocial, sociocultural, healthcare system, and biological variables as part of a conceptual model that incorporates psychosocial adversities, reserve capacity, and cumulative vulnerabilities as determinants of 24hour blood pressure variability. In project III we will create the Florida Puerto Rico Stroke Registry by collating data from 140 hospitals that are currently collecting Get With the Guidelines-Stroke data to help identify stroke disparities by race, ethnicity, and region and educate stakeholders in approaches to improve stroke quality regarding stroke disparities. Our program includes three cores: administrative core, the research/education training core, and the data management and statistics core. Our multidisciplinary program unites investigators across two minority-serving institutions, addresses significant gaps in our knowledge of stroke risk in Hispanics, and will provide results that can have an immediate impact on future primary and secondary stroke prevention efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This specialized collaborative program will address stroke disparities in the Hispanic population. The projects have been designed to develop culturally-tailored approaches to secondary and primary stroke prevention, as well as identify and reduce acute stroke disparities. The studies will provide immediate results to reduce stroke disparities and transportable approaches to address stroke disparities in other communities.",Hispanic Stroke Prevention Intervention Research Program,9483820,U54NS081763,"['Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Registries ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' statistics ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Universities ', ' Family member ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Guidelines ', ' Secondary to ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' psychosocial ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' data management ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Modeling ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' rapid growth ', ' Information Technology ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' glucose regulation ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose control ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' minority institution ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' education research ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' Caribbean Hispanic ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2017,178776,0.4637674641848016
"Disparities in Transition of Care after Acute Stroke Hospitalization: The Transition of Care Stroke Disparity Study (TCSD-S) Stroke, together with heart disease, accounts for the largest proportion of non-communicable diseases and deaths worldwide. In the US, there are 795,000 annual stroke cases and 150,000 deaths from stroke. Numbers will steeply increase with the aging population. Stroke remains the main cause of serious long-term disability with minorities being affected disproportionally. Greater risk of stroke exists among blacks and Hispanics at younger ages; blacks have greater stroke mortality. Though measures of quality of stroke care during acute hospitalization have improved, little evidence exists on the quality of processes leading to effective stroke prevention and rehabilitation after hospital discharge. Unexpected hospital readmissions 30 days after acute stroke hospitalization are common, as high as 25%, and lead to excess morbidity and cost. Stroke impact on patients', families', and communities' quality of life, and the burden on use and cost of health care is enormous. We propose the Transitions of Care Stroke Disparity Study (TCSD-S) with the main objective to identify race- ethnic and sex disparities in hospital-to-home transition of stroke care and outcomes, social determinants of health associated with these disparities, and to develop effective hospital-initiated system level initiatives to reduce disparities and readmissions, and to improve stroke outcomes. To achieve this objective, we will capitalize on the rich infrastructure and resources of our unique Florida Stroke Registry (FSR), which includes a well-developed network of hospitals, health providers, partnership with the AHA, and other Florida stakeholders. We will evaluate medication adherence, healthy lifestyle, utilization of rehabilitation interventions and medical follow-up 30 days after hospital discharge to home across representative Florida Comprehensive Stroke Centers. A novel Transitions of Stroke Care Performance Index (TOSC PI) will be derived and validated. Thi index will be a primary outcome together with hospital readmissions and stroke outcomes (disability, recurrence, cardiovascular events, and death). Data on TOSC and stroke outcomes will be collected by structured telephone interviews at 30 and 90 days after discharge and review of patient charts. Predictors of TOSC disparities and outcomes will be evaluated using baseline in-hospital data of the index stroke obtained from the FSR, and Social Determinants of Health obtained through a novel data collection instrument from publicly available records. Based on identified predictors of TOSC disparities, we will develop and assess the feasibility of initiatives to reduce TOSC disparities, targeting systems of care with a TOSC disparities dashboard, and health care providers with a training module for enhanced patient education and support at discharge and during follow-up. We will compare the TOSC PI and outcomes before and after the initiatives. The successful completion of this study will identify disparities in hospital-to-home TOSC, define key predictors of poor TOSC and stroke outcomes, and develop initiatives which will be scalable across health systems and which will address disparities, readmission rates, and poor outcomes. Project Narrative Despite improvements in the in-hospital treatment of acute stroke, readmissions, recurrent stroke, and disability remain common and affect minorities disproportionally as transition of care from hospital to home may be suboptimal. This project will define race/ethnic and sex disparities in transitions of care from hospital to home after stroke, identify modifiable factors, and develop initiatives that impact the health care system and educate health care providers to reduce disparities and improve outcomes after stroke. This project is relevant as it targets an understudied aspect of stroke care during transition of care from hospital to home, and may result in reductions of stroke recurrence, disability, readmissions, and disparities in care.  ",Disparities in Transition of Care after Acute Stroke Hospitalization: The Transition of Care Stroke Disparity Study (TCSD-S),9471154,R01MD012467,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Family ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Heart ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Morbidity -

"Program to Avoid Cerebrovascular Events Through Systematic Electronic Tracking and Tailoring of an Eminent Risk-factor (PACESETTER) Racial and rural-urban disparities in stroke care and outcomes are most prominent in the Southeastern region of the US, where 3 states have long been recognized as representing the `buckle' of a `stroke belt', i.e. highly stroke-prone tri-state area within a broader region already more heavily burdened with stroke compared to the rest of the country. One of these 3 states is South Carolina (SC). Fortunately, stroke is eminently preventable and hypertension (HTN) is the premier modifiable risk factor for stroke, but fewer than one third of patients with a recent stroke have their blood pressure (BP) controlled ≥75% of the time and low consistency of BP control is linked to higher risk of future major vascular events. Key factors responsible for uncontrolled HTN in African Americans (AA) are medication non-adherence and failure to intensify therapy in a timely manner. As such, culturally-tailored, efficacious blood pressure control programs which are acceptable, feasible, timely, and sustainable are needed, especially among hypertensive stroke survivors who reside in the stroke buckle or who are AA. Mobile health (mHealth) technology offers a promising approach to address this need. The overall objective of the Program to Avoid Cerebrovascular Events through Systematic Electronic Tracking and Tailoring of an Eminent Risk-factor (PACESETTER) study is to demonstrate that a theoretical-model- based, mHealth technology-centered, multi-level integrated approach can be effectively implemented to improve sustained BP control among stroke patients encountered in South Carolina (at least half of whom will be AA) within one month of stroke symptom onset. The primary aim is conduct an implementation trial (at the patient level) of the PACESETTER intervention [health technology (personalized phone text messaging and home BP monitoring)] vs. usual care in 200 recent stroke patients with hypertension recruited across the three main safety net hospitals in the state of SC (in the cities of Charleston, Columbia, and Greenville). Primary outcome will be achievement of guideline-recommended systolic blood pressure control at 12 months. We also aim to explore whether implementation of the PACESETTER intervention vs. standard care is associated with a reduction in subsequent cardiovascular event-related re-hospitalizations, shows a signal of potential efficacy in reducing actual vascular events, and has distinct effects on providers caring for patients with stroke. Altogether, the PACESETTER intervention, if proven effective and implementable, may eventually be exported to other medically underserved populations in the US beyond SC, as a feasible model of evidence-based post-stroke management. Stroke is a major public health problem leading to death, disability, and dementia. African Americans and people who live in the Southeastern region of the United States (US) experience a higher rate of stroke compared to people of other races and US regions; however, stroke is very preventable and adequately treating hypertension has the biggest effect on stroke prevention. This research seeks to test a mobile- phone and home monitoring based strategy for improving the currently poor control of hypertension among patients (half of whom will be African American) at high risk for future stroke in South Carolina, a State with an especially high rate of deaths from stroke.",Program to Avoid Cerebrovascular Events Through Systematic Electronic Tracking and Tailoring of an Eminent Risk-factor (PACESETTER),9471152,R01MD012441,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cities ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Patients ', ' Phonation ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' South Carolina ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Rural ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' forgetting ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' pill ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Provider ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Home Blood Pressure Monitoring ', ' Self Blood Pressure Monitoring ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' systematic review ', ' implementation trial ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' virtual ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' safety net ', ' modifiable risk ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' hypertension control ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke symptom ', ' urban disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2017,655253,0.3845593478065048
"DISPLACE: Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment Project Abstract Ischemic stroke is a potentially preventable, devastating complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), a group of inherited blood disorders that affect close to 100,000 individuals in the United States. Without intervention, stroke may occur in up to 24% of individuals with the highest risk form of SCD, sickle cell anemia. Despite improvements in comprehensive care and management of SCD in children, stroke remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to insufficient screening and prevention practices. Individuals living with SCD continue to face multiple health disparities cause by racial and socioeconomic factors as well as disease- specific disparities in funding and private sector support. In order to standardize and improve care, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) released evidence-based guidelines in 2014. These guidelines established routine transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) screening as a means for identifying children at high risk of stroke and indefinite chronic red cell transfusions (CRCT) as a means of treating children at high risk for stroke based on the previous NHLBI funded, randomized controlled STOP (Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Disease) results. This proposal, entitled DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) is a multi-site effort focused on enhancing the implementation and dissemination of these evidence-based stroke prevention guidelines in SCD. The research approach is guided by the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation and the multilevel ecological model of health. The DISPLACE leadership core at the Medical University of South Carolina is a multidisciplinary team lead by Dr. Julie Kanter, Dr. Robert Adams and Dr. Cathy Melvin and includes specialists in multicenter clinical trial design, hematology, implementation science, qualitative analysis and statistical evaluation. The Data Coordinating Unit (DCU) at MUSC who have coordinated over 40 multicenter studies and will provide study design and information technology support and data management support the leadership core. The aims of DISPLACE are to: 1) assess the gap between current and guideline- recommended practices for stroke prevention among pediatric patients with SCD, 2) assess the multi-level patient, provider, and systems barriers and enablers to performing TCD screening and initiating CRCT, and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of a novel multi-level dissemination and implementation strategy to increase current annual TCD screening rates and CRCT initiation rates using a parallel cluster-randomized clinical trial. We have assembled a large, multi-institutional collaboration of institutions with widespread geographic distribution to best assess the feasibility and utility of the multi-level implementation strategy. The long-term goal of DISPLACE is to ensure that all children with SCD receive guideline-based care for stroke prevention for a “stroke free generation” in SCD. Project Narrative Stroke is a potentially preventable, devastating complication in individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD), a blood disorder which a primarily affects a minority population in the United States. This proposal, entitled DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) is the first multi-site effort focused on enhancing the implementation and dissemination of evidence-based stroke prevention guidelines in sickle cell disease.

"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9195060,R01HL126700,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Apnea ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Elements ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Sleep Apnea Syndromes ', ' sleep-related breathing disorder ', ' Sleep-Disordered Breathing ', ' Sleep Hypopnea ', ' Sleep Apnea ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' Pulse Rates ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Devices ', ' Autonomic Dysfunction ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' surveillance study ', ' screening ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' stroke survivor ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' Risk stratification ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,722492,0.4811929638256092
"PeRiodontal treatment to Eliminate Minority InEquality and Rural disparities in Stroke (PREMIERS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death and the leading cause of long-term adult disability in the United States. Stroke remains more common in North and South Carolina, part of the ""buckle"" of the stroke belt, and disproportionately impacts African Americans. The reasons for this racial disparity are poorly understood and are not entirely explained by traditional stroke risk factors. The REGARDS study found that tooth loss (a surrogate of periodontal disease) was more common among African Americans than whites and was associated with higher stroke risk and stroke risk factors. Given this result, REGARDS investigators postulated that periodontal disease may be contributing to the racial disparity in stroke. Additional data from this study shows that low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with greater tooth loss, both of which are seen more frequently in African Americans as opposed to their white counterparts. Considering these factors, a question arises about whether low SES, race, a combination of the two, and/or traditional risk factors contribute to tooth loss, periodontl disease, and recurrent vascular events. Howard and colleagues suggest in their paper that race is the predominant factor contributing to vascular events after adjustment for SES and risk factors. If the predisposition exists among African Americans for greater periodontal disease and incident vascular events, then what modifications can clinicians make to prevent recurrent vascular events in this population? The PREMIERS study is a application for conducting an adequately powered two-center Phase III randomized controlled trial to test whether intensive periodontal treatment reduces the risk of recurrent vascular events among ischemic stroke and TIA survivors. The study uses the resources in both states including established dental centers, Joint Commission Certified Stroke Centers, the Schools of Public Health, and the Institute for Partnerships to Eliminate Health Disparities. The application addresses specific issues with regards to recruitment of African-American and rural stroke/TIA patients advocating the use of culturally appropriate strategies to educate the study subjects regarding stroke, periodontal disease and the periodontal stroke link. The study proposes to utilize economic evaluation of the periodontal intervention from the budgetary perspective. The focus will be on the financial sustainability of providing aggressive periodontal therapy (with certain, although relatively low expenditures) in exchange for a reduction of uncertain recurrent vascular events that may require high cost emergency department utilization and/or inpatient care. The sustainability of the proposed intervention after the completion of the project is integrally linked to the health economic assessment to show the health care cost savings. By integration with a rural primary care center, with an African American majority and households with average incomes below the state average, the study ensures that the proposed intervention to reduce stroke disparity is applicable to this target population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and periodontal disease are prevalent among African Americans residing in North Carolina and South Carolina, states recognized as the ""buckle"" of the stroke belt. Advanced periodontal disease is associated with an increased risk of recurrent vascular events in stroke/TIA patients. We propose a two-center Phase III randomized, controlled trial that will improve the understanding of biological mechanisms of stroke disparities, including race and socioeconomic status, through improved periodontal care.",PeRiodontal treatment to Eliminate Minority InEquality and Rural disparities in Stroke (PREMIERS),9194960,R01MD009738,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', '

"University of Wisconsin Regional Coordinating Center (UW RCC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Wisconsin-Madison Regional Coordinating Stroke Center (UW RCC) wiii support the regional organization of national NIH Stroke Trials. This will include prevention, treatment, and recovery. This RCC infrastructure will be based on the already established Wisconsin Network for Health Research (WiNHR), an NIH-sponsored research consortium including academic, urban, rural, and underserved and health disparity populations. It includes four major health systems with a total of 12.7 million outpatient visits per year. In addition to the WiNHR network, 26 additional health entities have been recruited for participation in this RCC including Native American communities. Experience in data correlation, study coordination, and CTSA infrastructure, will assure innovative training and success in the effort. Our experience in collaborative research will foster translation of preclinical and clinical trials, as well as a proven ability to recruit stroke patients. This integration of neurosurgery, vascular neurology, neurosurgery, interventional neuroradiology, neuro-intensive care, stroke rehabilitation, emergency medicine, pediatric neurology, and innovative neuro- imaging will enhance productivity. Through investigator initiated stroke research, training and trial design, we propose to enhance the overall national programs in stroke research rather than simply manage trials. Our plan is: 1) to improve the pre-hospital plan for acute stroke through collaborations with satellite hospitals. 2) To utilize established networks such as the Wisconsin Network for Health Research (WiNHR), Collaborative Center for Health Equity (CCHE), Community Health Connections (CHC), and expanding Telestroke never for enjoyment of our diverse patient population in clinical trials. 3) To educate providers across the care spec aim at the pre-hospital, satellite hospital, and tertiary referral hospital setting. 4) To improve clinical, IRB,-and data management infrastructure for satellite hospitals through trial protocol and data management experts available within existing infrastructure at the University of Wisconsin including the Institute for Collaborative and Transitional Research (ICTR), Office of Clinical Trials (OCT), and the Mobile Research Team (MRT). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Stroke is a disabling, often fatal complex disorder burdening public health expenditures and devastating personal and family impacts.

"Reducing Racial Disparities in Post-Stroke Disability in the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is common, nearly 800,000 strokes occur annually, and a leading cause of disability in the U.S. Non-Hispanic Black/African American (Black) adults have the highest stroke prevalence and suffer the most post-stroke disability of any U.S. racial/ethnic group. Even though racial disparities in post-stroke disability are widespread, little it is known about how to reduce this disparity. Racial differences in disability arise in the post-stroke period; however it is unclear if these differences arise shortly after strke in the early recovery period, when many stroke survivors are undergoing rehabilitation, or after stroke survivors return to the community. This project will address the critical questions of when racial disparities in post-stroke disability arise and determine the drivers of this disparity in ech period. Answering these questions is an essential step to designing interventions to improve health in Black stroke survivors and reduce disparities. To address these questions, we will rely on the newly available National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) linked to Medicare claims and functional assessment data. NHATS is a national, longitudinal survey of Medicare beneficiaries focused on understanding the causes and consequences of disability in the elderly. NHATS performs annual face-to-face interviews to carefully characterize disability in the elderly and measures a vast array of disability predictors including social, community and disability accommodation factors. Additionally NHATS's linkage to Medicare claims will enable measurement of important medical and rehabilitation factors that may also explain racial differences in post-stroke disability. These data sources will be used to develop the first comprehensive measures of rehabilitation intensity across all rehabilitation settings-home health, outpatient, skilled nursing and inpatient rehabilitation-compare intensity by race and estimate the effect of rehabilitation intensity on disability disparities. At the completion of the study, the timing and drivers of race differences in post-stroke disability will be identified. Furthermore, our novel measures of rehabilitation intensity can serve as a prototype for use in studying the role of rehabilitation in other diseases such as traumatic brain injury and arthritis. This proposal is particularly responsive to the NIMHD solicitation in that it focuses on modifiable drivers of racial differences in post-stroke disability from a policy standpoint and will directly inform stroke survivor and family level strategies to reduce disability and decrease disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-Hispanic Black/African American (Black) adults have more strokes and experience greater disability after their strokes than non-Hispanic White adults. Using newly available data, this project will determine the time when racial differences in post-stroke disability arise and the factors that lead to racial differences in post- stroke disabiity. These results will be directly used to develop strategies and interventions to improve the health of Black stroke survivors and reduce disparities.",Reducing Racial Disparities in Post-Stroke Disability in the Elderly,9249931,R01MD008879,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Arthritis ', ' Attention ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Home Health Agency ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Skilled Nursing Facilities ', ' Extended Care Facilities ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' trend ', ' Modification ', ' beneficiary ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' community living ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' Medicare claim ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' stroke survivor ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,387500,0.22415093848868395
"Metabolomic predictors of stroke in REGARDS Abstract There is a disproportionate burden of stroke among African Americans (AA) and individuals in the Southeastern United States, although the environmental and/or genetic underpinnings remain incompletely defined. Because metabolites integrate both environmental and genetic factors, they serve as proximal markers of human disease. In prior work supported by a Career Development Award, we established a rapid, multifunctional metabolomics platform that can be applied to large epidemiological cohorts. We now seek to focus our study on the metabolite predictors of cerebrovascular disease, an area that has received relatively little attention. To address these gaps in knowledge, we propose conducting metabolomics in stroke in the multiethnic REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke ( REGARDS) study, with further replication in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) and Framingham Heart Study (FHS). We will test the overarching hypothesis that metabolomics in well-phenotyped populations will illuminate stroke-associated metabolite pathways, and unravel racial differences among them. In Aim 1, we will identify metabolite risk factors for incident stroke, stratified by subtype, in the case-control cohort of the REGARDS study. We will profile metabolites from the baseline examination in ~1200 incident stroke cases and ~1200 controls matched for age, sex and race. In Aim 2, we will identify novel metabolite markers of known clinical risk traits for stroke, including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diet and exercise. In Aim 3, we will validate novel metabolite predictors of incident stroke and associated risk traits in the JHS and FHS cohorts. We will also test whether genetic variants that determine metabolite levels are in turn associated with clinical traits, through genetic risk score analysis. With extensive study data, the REGARDS study is uniquely positioned to catalyze the Aims of this proposal. Leveraging a novel small molecule profiling platform, our preliminary studies demonstrate the feasibility and significance of the Aims. Our multidisciplinary collaboration includes investigators at the MGH, UAB and University of Cincinnati, who bring collective expertise in metabolite profiling, biomarkers, genetic and population epidemiology, bioinformatics, metabolic traits, and health disparities. Finally, all data will be made publicly available, producing a unique scientific resource for the stroke research community. Narrative There are geographic and racial disparities in the burden of stroke across the United States. In this proposal, we will apply novel metabolite profiling techniques developed by our group to test the hypothesis that metabolomics will illuminate stroke-associated markers and unravel racial differences in that risk. These efforts have the potential to improve our ability to identify individuals at risk for stroke and improve the understanding of underlying mechanisms of disease.",Metabolomic predictors of stroke

"Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly Stroke is a major public health problem in the United States (US), with an estimated 800,000 strokes each year and an estimated 7 million stroke survivors. Cognitive decline and impairment are major contributors to disability after a stroke, ranging from mild cognitive impairment with minor impact on daily activities to severe dementia that requires substantial assistance including nursing home placement. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal form of dementia and is the fifth leading cause of death among people aged ≥65 years in the US. Stroke and AD are strongly age-dependent. Because the US population is aging, the population at risk for these conditions will increase over the coming decades. There is increasing evidence of associations between stroke and AD/dementia. It is estimated that over 60% of patients have cognitive impairment within the first year after their stroke, and the prevalence is even higher after a recurrent stroke. The risk of developing dementia among stroke survivors is two to four times that of the general age-matched population. It is estimated that 10-15% of stroke patients have dementia prior to their stroke, but there are limited data on stroke outcomes for patients with AD. African-American and Hispanic populations are at increased risk for both conditions, but little is known about the outcomes for individuals with both diseases. This administrative supplement will build upon the Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly parent R01 grant to examine the interrelationship between AD and ischemic stroke in elderly Medicare beneficiaries and assess potential disparities by demographic characteristics and geographic location. Medicare administrative data will be used to achieve the following specific aims: 1) among elderly fee-for-service beneficiaries hospitalized with ischemic stroke, determine patterns in the rate of AD within 1 year and assess the impact of AD on stroke recurrence, post- acute care services, and cost; and 2) among beneficiaries with an AD diagnosis, determine patterns in the rate of stroke within 1 year and assess the impact of the event on outcomes. The proposed study will address research priorities identified by the National Institute on Aging, the Institute of Medicine, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, to develop surveillance systems to understand the continuum of disease prevention, progression, treatment, and outcomes, particularly for vulnerable populations. The project also addresses priorities in Healthy People 2020, to reduce the morbidity and costs associated with, and maintain or enhance the quality of life for, persons with dementia, including AD. Clinical practice, public policy, and reimbursement decisions are increasingly informed by administrative datasets. Results from this supplement will provide much needed information on the outcomes, resource utilization, and costs for individuals who develop both stroke and AD.

"Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly Stroke is a major public health problem in the United States. It is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of serious disability in adults. There are an estimated 800,000 strokes in the United States each year, with an estimated 7 million stroke survivors. Twenty percent of stroke survivors require institutional care after 3 months and 15%-30% are permanently disabled. Recurrent events, which occur in 185,000 stroke survivors in the United States each year, are associated with higher mortality rates, greater levels of disability, and increased costs as compared with first strokes. Stroke in adults is strongly age dependent, and the rate of adverse outcomes and complications associated with stroke increases with advanced age. Because the United States population is aging, the population at risk for stroke and recurrent events will increase over the coming decades. The high prevalence of stroke and its associated deficits impose a large burden on patients, their families, and the healthcare system. Optimizing post-acute care and secondary prevention efforts for stroke survivors represents an important target to reduce the burden of recurrent stroke, particularly among the elderly. Racial/ethnic and regional disparities have been identified for stroke incidence, prevalence, and mortality, but relatively little research has focused on potential disparities in the patterns of recurrent stroke events. The Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly study will use Medicare administrative data to achieve the following specific aims: 1) to assess temporal patterns in national recurrent stroke rates among elderly Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with ischemic stroke and describe disparities by sociodemographic and comorbid/clinical characteristics; and 2) to determine county-level rates of recurrent stroke, the persistence of geographic patterns over time, and county-level factors that may be contributing to disparities. Clinical practice, public policy, and reimbursement decisions are increasingly informed by data obtained from administrative datasets. The Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly study will be the largest contemporary investigation of recurrent stroke rates and patterns in the United States. Results from this project will identify geographic areas and subgroups that have distinctive health profiles that put them at high risk for recurrent stroke. Such information will inform care providers, insurers, public health agencies, and policy makers about communities that may derive the greatest benefit from targeted programs and community-based interventions. Results from the study will provide clinicians, investigators, and policymakers with national data on rates, trends, and patterns of recurrent stroke hospitalizations among the elderly, including variation among patient subgroups and geographic regions.",Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly,9793035,R01AG056628,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Aging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Progress Review Group ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' beneficiary ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' national surveillance ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention Guidelines ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' stroke survivor ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' racial minority ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' American Stroke Association ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke incidence ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' stroke outcome ', ' stroke event ', ' ']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,108868,0.4395792989166042
"Racial Disparities, Influenza Like Illness and the Association between Short-term Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Outcomes Heart Disease is the leading cause of death in the US, with approximately 735,000 myocardial infarction (MI) events per year. Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the US and the number one cause of long-­term adult disability with nearly 800,000 stroke events in the US each year. The reduction of risk factors for stroke and heart disease has become a high priority, with policy efforts implementing risk reduction efforts. Novel risk factors such as inflammation and infection, including influenza like illness (ILI), or environmental exposures, such as air pollution, are known to be risk factors for MI and stroke. Moreover, ambient air pollution increases the risk of ILI, suggesting the potential for air pollution triggering an ILI event, which then subsequently triggers a stroke or MI event. Racial disparities are highly prevalent in not only the levels of air pollution, but also in the health effects of air pollution, as well as having a major role in the risk of ILI, stroke and MI. Racial and ethnic minorities are at higher risk to be exposed to high levels of air pollution, and are t higher risk for infections, stroke and MI. While the relationships between air pollution/cardiovascular disease and air pollution/ILI have been independently recognized, the combined relationship between air pollution, ILI and subsequent cardiovascular events, and how racial disparities influence this relationship has not yet been investigated. To overcome the current barriers to knowledge, this application aims to (1) determine the effect racial disparities has on the relationship ILI has on the association between air pollution and MI (2) determine the effect racial disparities has on the relationship ILI has on the association between air pollution and stroke, and (3) identify the populations at greatest risk for having an MI or stroke due to the combined effects of air pollution and ILI. Furthermore, no study has addressed these relationships in a large scale, generalizable dataset that allows for exploration of geographical, urban/rural, or differences across biologically relevant variables, such as sex and age, that could further influence these relationships. We will use two separate, large-­scale administrative datasets to assess these relationships. The analyses will be conducted in the MarketScan dataset first, and then replicated in the SPARCS dataset. MarketScan is an administrative dataset with nearly 230 million de-­identified patients with longitudinal information on patient demographics, including residential metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and 3-­digit zipcode, and ICD-­9 codes (pre-­2015) or ICD-­10 codes (post-­2015) diagnosis and procedure codes for all inpatient and outpatient visits linked by a de-­identified patient identifier code. The analyses will then be replicated in the New York Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) dataset, a comprehensive data reporting system that collects information on hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits within the state of New York with detailed information on patient characteristics, demographics and diagnoses. The innovation of this idea is identifying at risk groups as defined by air pollution status and ILI as opposed to traditional risk factors. The overall goal of this project is to investigate racial disparities in the association between air pollution, influenza like illness and subsequent stroke and myocardial infarction. The proposed research will use data from two administrative claims databases, MarketScan and the New York Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) dataset. The proposed NIMHD Health Services Research on Minority Health and Health Disparities Grant Application (R21) will answer important questions regarding the racial disparities in the association between air pollution on influenza like illness, and how this relates to stroke or myocardial infarction risk.      ","Racial Disparities, Influenza Like Illness and the Association between Short-term Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Outcomes",9571125,R21MD012451,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Influenza ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza virus vaccine ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' Flu vaccine ', ' Inpatients ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' New York ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Respiratory Tract Infections ', ' Respiratory Infections ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Procedures ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Rural ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' metropolitan ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) ', ' ICD-10 ', ' ICD-9 ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' racial minority ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' stroke event ', ' ']",NIMHD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2018,200000,0.29580487768904007
"DISPLACE: Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment Project Abstract Ischemic stroke is a potentially preventable, devastating complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), a group of inherited blood disorders that affect close to 100,000 individuals in the United States. Without intervention, stroke may occur in up to 24% of individuals with the highest risk form of SCD, sickle cell anemia. Despite improvements in comprehensive care and management of SCD in children, stroke remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to insufficient screening and prevention practices. Individuals living with SCD continue to face multiple health disparities cause by racial and socioeconomic factors as well as disease- specific disparities in funding and private sector support. In order to standardize and improve care, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) released evidence-based guidelines in 2014. These guidelines established routine transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) screening as a means for identifying children at high risk of stroke and indefinite chronic red cell transfusions (CRCT) as a means of treating children at high risk for stroke based on the previous NHLBI funded, randomized controlled STOP (Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Disease) results. This proposal, entitled DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) is a multi-site effort focused on enhancing the implementation and dissemination of these evidence-based stroke prevention guidelines in SCD. The research approach is guided by the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation and the multilevel ecological model of health. The DISPLACE leadership core at the Medical University of South Carolina is a multidisciplinary team lead by Dr. Julie Kanter, Dr. Robert Adams and Dr. Cathy Melvin and includes specialists in multicenter clinical trial design, hematology, implementation science, qualitative analysis and statistical evaluation. The Data Coordinating Unit (DCU) at MUSC who have coordinated over 40 multicenter studies and will provide study design and information technology support and data management support the leadership core. The aims of DISPLACE are to: 1) assess the gap between current and guideline- recommended practices for stroke prevention among pediatric patients with SCD, 2) assess the multi-level patient, provider, and systems barriers and enablers to performing TCD screening and initiating CRCT, and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of a novel multi-level dissemination and implementation strategy to increase current annual TCD screening rates and CRCT initiation rates using a parallel cluster-randomized clinical trial. We have assembled a large, multi-institutional collaboration of institutions with widespread geographic distribution to best assess the feasibility and utility of the multi-level implementation strategy. The long-term goal of DISPLACE is to ensure that all children with SCD receive guideline-based care for stroke prevention for a “stroke free generation” in SCD. Project Narrative Stroke is a potentially preventable, devastating complication in individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD), a blood disorder which a primarily affects a minority population in the United States. This proposal, entitled DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) is the first multi-site effort focused on enhancing the implementation and dissemination of evidence-based stroke prevention guidelines in sickle cell disease.

"Left Atrial abNormality, ThromboEmbolism, and Race: Novel risk factors for stroke (LANTERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  African Americans face a two-fold higher risk of ischemic stroke than white residents of the U.S. The reasons for this black-white stroke disparity are not completely known. This proposal seeks to identify whether atrial cardiopathy, a novel risk factor, partly explains the higher stroke risk in blacks. Compared to whites, blacks experience less atrial fibrillation, a heart-rhythm disorder that is one of the strongest known risk factors for stroke. In the prevailing clinical paradigm, it is thought that atrial fibrillation is required for blood clots to form in the heart's left atrium, from where they can embolize to the brain and cause stroke. However, recent research indicates that embolization from the left atrium can occur when there are abnormalities in atrial tissue and function—a condition referred to as atrial cardiopathy—regardless of whether there is atrial fibrillation. Preliminary data suggest that atrial cardiopathy manifests differently in blacks than whites: more often with left atrial abnormality on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and less often with atrial fibrillation or its typical accompaniment, left atrial enlargement on an echocardiogram. As a result, atrial thromboembolism may often go unrecognized in blacks because it occurs in the absence of atrial fibrillation and atrial enlargement. The proposed research will test the central hypothesis that currently unexplained disparities in stroke between whites and blacks can be partly explained by differences in the manifestation of atrial cardiopathy. This application is for an ancillary study to the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study and the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study (GCNKSS). REGARDS is a longitudinal cohort study that seeks to shed light on the relationship between baseline risk factors and future stroke in >30,000 black and white individuals. GCNKSS is a population-based epidemiological study of racial disparities in the incidence and outcomes of stroke in a biracial population of 1.3 million. Taking advantage of the complementary designs of these studies, the proposed research will first determine the relationship between baseline ECG-defined left atrial abnormality, race, and future stroke in REGARDS. It will then determine black-white differences in GCNKSS in markers that signify a potential atrial thromboembolic cause of stroke. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypotheses that blacks have a higher prevalence of left atrial abnormality, that left atrial abnormality is associated with future stroke, and that left atrial abnormality contributes to the higher stroke risk in blacks. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypotheses that black patients with ischemic stroke more often have ECG-defined left atrial abnormality and less often have echocardiographic left atrial enlargement than whites. All ECGs and a subset of echocardiogram images will be centrally interpreted. This research promises to show that blacks' higher stroke risk partly reflects actionable differences in the biology of stroke. Such findings may ultimately lead to therapy using existing medications approved for atrial fibrillation. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of novel and treatable cardiac risk factors for stroke will ultimately improve risk factor screening and stroke prevention efforts, thereby reducing the incidence of a disabling and lethal disease. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NINDS's mission that involves reducing the burden of neurological disease by fostering research on the causes and prevention of stroke. The proposed research also addresses NINDS' top priority for future directions of stroke epidemiology research, which is to improve the understanding of race and ethnic stroke disparities.","Left Atrial abNormality, ThromboEmbolism, and Race: Novel risk factors for stroke (LANTERN)",9478607,R01NS097443,"['Anticoagulants ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' blood thinner ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Biology ', ' Blood coagulation ', ' Blood Clotting ', ' Body Surface Area ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Dilatation - action ', ' Dilatation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Therapeutic Embolization ', ' embolization ', ' Embolotherapy ', ' Embolization Therapy ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Future ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' atrium ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Hypertrophy ', ' Incidence ', ' Kentucky ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mission ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Thromboembolism ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Left Atrium ', ' Left atrial structure ', ' cardiac rhythm ', ' heart rhythm ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Modeling ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Cardiac ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' screening ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' biracial ', ' black/white disparity ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' stroke outcome ', ' ']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2018,329398,0.48644934031422177
"Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to continue our population-based study of stroke incidence and case fatality, prevalence of risk factors, stroke treatment, and post-stroke outcomes within a biracial metropolitan population of 1,368,604 of whom 223,417 (16.3%) are of black race (US Census 2010). The proposed work will involve an anticipated ~3,750 patients with 4,250 strokes and/or transient ischemic attacks from our region in 2014/2015, an estimated ~600 recurrent strokes from 2015-2018 (following all strokes and transient ischemic attacks for 3 years after the original 2014/2015 event), as well as 2,000 survey participants.  For almost 20 years, we have studied trends in stroke incidence and case fatality and have demonstrated a racial disparity where stroke incidence in African-Americans is more than double that of whites. In each prior study period, we have also examined the prevalence of risk factors (and knowledge of stroke) via a population survey in order to put our temporal trend findings into context.  In addition to continuing these important activities, we seek to examine stroke recurrence in a population- based fashion (which has not been done since the 1990's) with the goal of identifying whether there is a racial disparity in stroke recurrence. We propose an innovative pilot study to determine if we can estimate functional outcome and place of residence at 3- and 6-months post-stroke without patient contact, using a local health- information exchange (HIE) and electronic health record. We will compare our estimate to phone interviews with the subject as the ""gold standard""; the phone interview to be used was successfully piloted in the current period. Finally, we have used our data to inform eligibility for stroke clinical trils. We propose to share our data with the scientific community for this purpose. In our proposed work, we will have data regarding acute stroke presentation and will add information about stroke recurrence and post-stroke functional outcomes that can be used for rational planning of stroke interventions in all phases of stroke (acute, secondary prevention, recovery).  In all of th proposed activities, the use of the HIE will make the proposed work possible (harnessing the power of centralized health data) and will be important for accomplishing the work efficiently. Overall, our proposed study will accomplish more than prior periods in a shorter time and without increased cost. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The change in stroke occurrence and recurrence over time is the ultimate test of how well science has translated new discoveries into benefits for the population. Our study has examined racial disparities in stroke over the last 20 years, showing that blacks have higher risk for stroke than whites. In our population, the occurrence of stroke is decreasing in whites but NOT African-Americans, and we will continue to describe trends in stroke occurrence, recurrence, cause, treatment, and outcome in a biracial metropolitan population.",Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites,9450556,R01NS030678,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Black race ', ' Censuses ', ' Transient Ischemic Attack ', ' Brain TIA ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Kentucky ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Destinations ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Recovery ', ' Collaborations ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Medical center ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' research study ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Prevention ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Data ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' stroke recovery ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' Secure ', ' screening ', ' health data ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' biracial ', ' stroke intervention ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke treatment ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Time trend ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke incidence ', ' stroke outcome ', ' stroke event ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R01,2018,1450842,0.48278824196710807
"Built environments on stroke risk and stroke disparities in a national sample ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and a top cause of serious long-term disability. A number of stroke risk factors have been established at the individual-level; however, these risk factors only partially explain stroke risk and account for only half of the racial disparities in stroke. Novel exposures of stroke risk must be identifie to improve our understanding of stroke risk and to develop effective interventions. Recently, built and social environments (BSEs) have been identified as important factors to examine to further our understanding of cardiovascular disease. However, to date no studies have examined the effect of BSEs on stroke risk. BSEs may also help to explain the large racial and geographic disparities in stroke rates although this has yet to be empirically examined nationally. The proposed study would address these gaps by utilizing a unique assembled cohort, namely the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. The REGARDS cohort is a national sample of adults over age 45, with oversamples of African-American participants and persons in the stroke belt. The proposed study will expand the REGARDS study to examine the effects of BSEs on incident stroke risk and on racial and geographic disparities in stroke. These aims will be achieved by obtaining data on a broad range of BSE characteristics of the REGARDS participants' built environment (e.g., food availability, park availability, food prices, physical activity facility availability, land use, steet connectivity and neighborhood physical environment) and participants' social environment (objective crime, perceived crime, neighborhood SES, social cohesion, racial residential segregation, social support and social networks, and neighborhood social environment). The data will be obtained from a number of sources including secondary commercial and administrative sources, participant self-reports and primary audits using the Street View feature in Google Earth. Environmental data will be spatially linked to participant data of the REGARDS case-cohort study. The proposed study aims to 1) examine the extent to which BSEs contribute to incident stroke risk in the REGARDS study; and 2) determine the extent to which BSEs explain racial and geographic disparities in incident stroke. The proposed study builds on important preliminary studies and the extensive relevant experience of the investigative team, which includes prominent scholars across a number of institutions. The proposed research provides a cost-effective way to examine the importance of BSEs for stroke prevention across diverse community settings and racial groups. Identifying the BSE characteristics that are predictive of incident stroke and BSEs that contribute to racial and geographic disparities will help inform future modifications of environments to improve population health. At the end of the study period, the BSE data will be made available to others through the REGARDS data sharing protocols; thus the measures in the proposed study will be available to the greater scientific community for use in research pertaining to other disease outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is a leading cause of death and serious long-term disability. The goal of this study is to identify salient built and social environmental factors tht are associated with risk of incident stroke and how those factors contribute to racial and geographical disparities in stroke.

"Mechanisms underlying race disparities in gastrostomy placement after stroke Project Summary/Abstract Racial differences in the utilization of therapeutic procedures in stroke patients are pervasive and contribute to worse outcomes in minorities compared to whites after stroke. Swallowing dysfunction immediately after stroke is common, but most patients recover adequate swallowing function within a few days or weeks. Percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) tubes for enteral feeding are commonly placed for patients who are perceived unlikely to recover adequate swallowing function in a timely manner, but ideally are avoided as PEG placement is invasive, carries the risk of procedure-related complications, and has been associated with poor long-term outcomes. Clinical decision-making surrounding PEG placement lacks objective and standardized criteria, but is largely dependent on clinical swallowing evaluations by Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) providers, and use of ancillary radiographic swallow studies such as a videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS). The PI’s preliminary data show that PEG tubes are overutilized in minorities compared to whites despite similar stroke severity, medical comorbidities, and incidence of swallowing dysfunction. The research proposed in the current application will investigate the potential mechanisms underlying racial disparities in PEG tube placement after stroke by thoroughly addressing the various care processes involved in evaluation of swallowing recovery and decision-making regarding PEG placement. The specific aims are (1) to investigate whether access to SLP services including frequency of bedside swallow evaluations and VFSS testing differs among black and white stroke patients, (2) to determine the presence of an unconscious (implicit) racial bias and its effect on PEG decision-making among SLP providers, and (3) to assess whether patient-SLP provider communication behavior during bedside swallow evaluations differs between race-concordant (white patient, white SLP provider), and race-discordant (black patient, white SLP provider) patient-SLP provider pairs. This project is proposed as part of a career development plan for the PI, a cerebrovascular neurologist, to obtain training in methodology related to the study of implicit bias, patient-provider communication, and advanced statistical methods. The training program and the mentoring team the PI has assembled will help to elucidate important mechanisms underlying racial disparities in PEG placement after stroke, position him to apply the newly acquired skill set to investigate implicit bias and patient-provider communication behavior as the underlying mechanisms of other disparities in stroke care, and allow him to develop strategies aimed at mitigating disparities in stroke care via future interventional studies as he transitions to become an independent clinical investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Racial differences in the utilization of inpatient procedures, such as gastrostomy tubes, are common after stroke, and contribute to worse health outcomes among minorities compared to whites. The aim of this study is to understand the mechanisms underlying overutilization of gastrostomy tubes in black compared to white stroke patients, specifically to elucidate the role of differential access to Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) care, implications of implicit race bias among SLP providers, and patient-provider communication behavior.

"Assessing Population-based Radiological brain health in Stroke Epidemiology (APRISE) Study DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT: Stroke recurrence is a major public health problem. It has been understudied epidemiologically despite comprising ~25% of all stroke in the US, and leading to higher morbidity and mortality compared to initial events. Furthermore, compared to our understanding of the role of traditional risk factors for first stroke, we have limited understanding of the risk factors for recurrent stroke. Radiological measures of small vessel and large-vessel disease may provide a measure of a subject’s current “Brain Health” to predict future cerebrovascular events and vascular dementia. Understanding small vessel disease in particular—manifesting as white matter hyperintensity, microbleeds, lacunar infarcts, dilated perivascular spaces, and brain atrophy–is a top NINDS priority. Although the Framingham risk score is widely used for clinical decision-making, and the ABCD scores predict 90-day stroke risk among minor stroke/TIA patients, no clinical prediction tool in a broader ischemic or a hemorrhagic stroke population-based cohort has been established. A Framingham-like “Risk Function Tool for Secondary Stroke,” especially one incorporating the full gamut of modern imaging parameters developed in a racially diverse population, would likely identify high-risk patients for targeted education interventions, novel antithrombotics, and aggressive clinical care. Moreover, it may reveal novel causal pathways and risk factors for future investigation. We propose an ancillary study to the ongoing Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study (GCKNSS) entitled APRISE (Assessing Population-based Radiological brain health in Stroke Epidemiology). Our objective is to build on the GCNKSS infrastructure to radiologically characterize the full stroke/TIA population of Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky from 2015 and create the first modern, largely MRI-based characterization of brain health in a contemporary stroke/TIA population. Our specific aim is to create a prediction model of cerebrovascular disease recurrence (ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke) incorporating imaging parameters in a biracial, large-scale ischemic stroke/TIA population using state-of-the-art modeling approaches. We will achieve these goals by radiologically characterizing the stroke/TIA population (~2700 ischemic and ~525 hemorrhagic stroke, and ~1025 TIA patients) in the NIH-funded GCNKSS of a 1.4 million, biracial population. We will leverage the extensive GCNKSS infrastructure, which is already in place to detect recurrent stroke, placing us in a unique position to develop a recurrent stroke risk model using newly acquired radiologic data with remarkable efficiency. The proposed study will allow the first and only population-based characterization of the entire imaging spectrum of brain health in stroke/TIA patients. Our multi-disciplinary team with imaging, epidemiology, outcomes, and biostatistics expertise will address NINDS priority research areas with precision and innovation currently unavailable. NARRATIVE: Stroke recurrence (or a second stroke event after an initial stroke) is a major public health burden.

"Stroke Central Atlantic Network for Research (SCANR) SCANR, the Stroke Central Atlantic Network for Research is based in the Mid-Atlantic region and headquartered in Washington, DC, and Charlottesville, VA. SCANR is located on the edge of the Stroke Belt, and both DC and Baltimore have high stroke incidence. SCANR includes four Carnegie Research 1 universities (Georgetown and George Washington Universities; the Universities of Virginia and Maryland), two CTSAs, a translational research institute (THRIV), a US News & World Report National Honor Roll Hospital (Children's National Medical Center), the largest hospital in DC (MedStar Washington Hospital Center), two Historically Black Universities (Howard University and University of DC) and the NINDS Intramural Stroke Program. SCANR sites evaluated over 4100 acute strokes in 2016, >50% were Black/African American. Our NINDS-funded trial recruitment is excellent, screening all eligible patients for and enrolling in StrokeNet trials: DEFUSE 3, MISTIE 3, HiDef, Rhapsody, SHINE, POINT, and MR WITNESS, along with additional NINDS-funded trials. SCANR also includes the National Coordinating Center for SHINE (UVa, Johnston-PI), and the CREST-2 registry and imaging core (UMB, Lal). SCANR 2.0 continues to have all of the excellent qualities that made SCANR 1.0 a strong contender for StrokeNet selection: pediatric stroke and stroke rehabilitation, patient populations and innovative recruitment practices for health disparities research, and the link to the NINDS Intramural Stroke Program. These strengths will stand out with the pediatric, rehab, and pediatric rehab trials in the StrokeNet pipeline. SCANR 2.0 includes UVa as a high-performing site for acute treatment and prevention trials. UVa also provides expertise in biomarkers, genetics, and prehospital research. The addition of UVa and UMB made SCANR a truly regional Coordinating Center. SCANR 2.0 research expertise includes multimodal imaging, microbiomics, multi-omics, Neurorehabilitation trials, brain stimulation, and robotics. We are well positioned to translate early phase NINDS intramural studies into the extramural setting. We have a track record of recruiting substantial numbers of specific cerebrovascular phenotypes (cervical artery dissection, cerebral venous thrombosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, etc.). Our consortium of academic rehab hospitals is outstanding. We currently have four trial proposals submitted to StrokeNet in varying stages of the process. Our existing Participant Recruitment and Retention Core (PRRO Core) has played a leadership role in the StrokeNet network. SCANR investigators serve on national StrokeNet steering committees and cores. Our StrokeNet fellows have diverse clinical backgrounds (2 vascular neurologists, 1 PT PhD, 1 OT) and subsequently, they successfully compete for external funding (TL-2, KL-2, AHA). They have opportunities for outstanding research training and mentorship across our Mid-Atlantic institutions, preparing them for productive research careers. SCANR investigators recently successfully established a novel national K12 program for rehabilitation research. We currently have 5 relevant fellowship programs and three adult neurology residencies at the SCANR 2.0 sites. This training joins strong multidisciplinary clinical and research expertise in stroke with much experience in research and career development of clinician scientists. The Stroke Central Atlantic Network for Research encompasses the Mid-Atlantic region. As a Regional Coordinating Center (RCC), it will continue recruiting people with stroke for trials ranging from prevention to acute intervention to rehabilitation. The unusual features of this RCC are its capture of nearly all stroke patients in DC and much of the Mid-Atlantic, its ability to recruit underserved individuals from both urban and rural settings, and its research strengths in multimodal MRI, genetics, Neurorehabilitation, and disparities.",Stroke Central Atlantic Network for Research (SCANR),9570418,U24NS107222,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Arteries ', ' Baltimore ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Dissection ', ' Hospitals ', ' Leadership ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maryland ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mid-Atlantic Region ', ' Middle Atlantic States ', ' Neurology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Registries ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Venous Thrombosis ', ' Phlebothrombosis ', ' Virginia ', ' Washington ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' base ', ' career ', ' stroke rehab ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Cervical ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' news ', ' Genetic ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' Rehabilitation Research ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Fellowship Program ', ' K12 Program ', ' K12 Mechanism ', ' Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Program ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' treatment trial ', ' pediatric stroke ', ' Childhood stroke ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' multimodality ', ' patient population ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' Prevention trial ', ' multi-omics ', ' multiple omics ', ' urban setting ', ' rural setting ', ' recruit ', ' participant retention ', ' microbiome studies ', ' microbiome science ', ' Microbiomics ', ' microbiome research ', ' Stroke Belt ', ' stroke patient ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke incidence ', ' StrokeNet trials ', ' stroke trials ', ' ']",NINDS,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U24,2018,333453,0.358538212414458
"StrokeBelt StrokeNet The proposed StrokeBelt StrokeNet (SBSN) RCC will benefit from the established infrastructure, basic science and clinical stroke expertise, and stroke clinical trial experience at UAB, and work with established partner institutions in the Southeastern US, including Children’s of Alabama, the UAB/Lakeshore Research Collaborative, the University of Mississippi Medical Center, and the University of South Alabama. Each institution has its own network of referral hospitals, clinical trial infrastructure and experience enrolling in stroke clinical trials. The result is that a large part of the Stroke Belt will have access to StrokeNet Clinical Trials. The SBSN will succeed by leveraging key attributes of our region and network. First, the SBSN RCC will offer combined access to nearly 3,500 acute stroke patients annually, many of them minorities, in an underserved part of the US. As in our NeuroNext program, we will aggressively pursue the inclusion of underrepresented and minority populations in our clinical trials through collaboration with the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Center (MHRC) and Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment (STRIDE). Second, UAB and its partners have a track record of patient‐ oriented stroke research and successful stroke clinical trial recruitment. Over the last 3 years, UAB alone has participated in 20 NIH‐ or industry‐sponsored multicenter phase 1, 2 and 3 trials in stroke treatment, prevention, and recovery, enrolling 401 patients. We were nationally‐leading recruiters in the TUCSON, CUFFS, CLOTBUST‐HF, SAMMPRIS and CLEAR III trials. We actively enrolled in the first StrokeNet trial, DEFUSE3, are currently enrolling in CREST‐2, and preparing for participation in ARCADIA and CREST‐H. We are the leading recruiting center in MyRIAD and the second leading center for MISTIE III. Over the last 3 years, SBSN institutions/investigators have participated in a total of 37 trials in stroke treatment, prevention, and recovery, and enrolled a total of 2050 subjects. Third, we have extensive experience in stroke recovery with specific expertise in stroke‐related aphasia recovery/rehabilitation, TMS and imaging, motor recovery, tele‐rehabilitation and robotics. Fourth, our proposed network will be strengthened by the already‐strong connections between the UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) and our partner institutions. All of the institutions in our proposed network are already our partners, and already have experience with master IRB reliance agreements. Fifth, our research program will build upon our already‐successful recruitment by applying a performance improvement approach to enhance clinical trial screening, enrollment and retention. Strategies include specific screening, enrollment and retention methods; rigorous and continuous monitoring and performance improvement of trial implementation and subject screening, enrollment and retention; training and sharing of best practices; and programs to enhance engagement and enthusiasm of investigators and coordinators across the network. Sixth, the training of stroke clinical scientists at UAB will be enhanced through programs developed with the UAB CCTS and UAB School of Public Health (SOPH). The proposed StrokeBelt StrokeNet (SBSN) RCC has a robust network of institutions with access to a large population of potential subjects, many of them minorities, in an underserved part of the US, a track record of successful enrollment in stroke clinical trials, a rich community of basic science and translational stroke researchers, and an extraordinarily collaborative environment with the desire to contribute to the StrokeNet effort.",StrokeBelt StrokeNet,9570390,U24NS107223,"['Alabama ', ' Awareness ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Heart ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' Industry ', ' Methods ', ' Mississippi ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neurology ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Patients ', ' Quality Control ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Robotics ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' human subject ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Neurologist ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' Recovery ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Medical center ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' minority health ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' telerehab ', ' tele-rehabilitation ', ' telerehabilitation ', ' operation ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' screening ', ' Patient risk ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative environment ', ' motor recovery ', ' aphasia recovery ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke treatment ', ' minority communities ', ' recruit ', ' Stroke Belt ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke clinical trials ', ' StrokeNet trials ', ' StrokeNet clinical trials ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U24,2018,317202,0.27037371954526007
"A Community Based Participatory Trial to Increase Stroke Treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-stroke disability represents a significant public health problem. Currently, there are over 7 million stroke survivors in the US, most of whom have persistent disability. Despite the fact that acute stroke treatments dramatically reduce post-stroke disability and are cost saving, they are markedly underutilized. There is no region in the US where acute stroke treatments are more underutilized than in Flint, Michigan. Flint is an urban, underserved city with nearly 100,000 residents of whom about 60% are African American. One of the main reasons for acute stroke treatment underutilization is pre-hospital delay-patients arrive to the hospital too late to receive the treatment. For the past 6 years, the Community Health Partnership-composed of academic partners from the University of Michigan and community partners, Bridges into the Future-has worked to increase acute stroke treatment rates in Flint by decreasing pre-hospital delay. The Community Health Partnership completed several community needs assessments, and from those designed and tested a peer-led, health behavior theory-based intervention in African American churches. The intervention focused on increasing stroke preparedness (i.e., increasing community member's recognition of stroke warning signs and the importance of calling 911 immediately for stroke). This community intervention, Stroke Ready, successfully increased stroke preparedness. The current application represents the larger scale adaption and testing of the Stroke Ready intervention to increase the Flint community's acute stroke treatment rates. Stroke Ready, now expanded to a multi-level intervention, aims to increase acute stroke treatment through both community stroke preparedness and Emergency Department readiness. The Stroke Ready community intervention will adapt and expand the Stroke Ready pilot intervention consisting of interactive workshops and a stroke music video to newly include community-wide education activities such as social media and mass print media. We will also collaborate with a Flint safety-net hospital, where the majority of stroke patients are African American that is in great need of improved acute stroke care, to optimize treatment pathways. The primary outcome of the project will be change in acute stroke treatments, which will directly benefit the entire community by reducing post-stroke disability. Sustainability will be achieved in Flint by training of peer-leaders, wide dissemination of Stroke Ready materials, ease of administering the intervention, hospital improvements and continued commitment and engagement of the Community Advisory Board. The products of this application include a strategy to improve acute stroke treatments in safety-net hospitals and the easy to deliver Stroke Ready community intervention to allow for sustainability and dissemination.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If acute stroke treatments are given soon after the start of a stroke, they can reduce the chance that stroke survivors are left with disability. Yet few stroke patients, particularly African Americans, receive these treatments. In this project, community and academic researchers will work together to increase the number of patients who receive acute stroke treatments in the predominately African American community of Flint, Michigan.        ",A Community Based Participatory Trial to Increase Stroke Treatment,9487006,U01MD010579,"['Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Michigan ', ' Music ', ' Patients ', ' Printed Media ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Cost Savings ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Acute ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Relative Risks ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Church ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Address ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' community intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' stroke recovery ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' safety net ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' implementation science ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' successful intervention ', ' 911 call ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' social media ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke symptom ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke treatment ', ' urban underserved ', ' recruit ', ' therapy optimization ', ' treatment optimization ', ' stroke patient ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke incidence ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,952102,0.45767615548086965
"HISPANIC SECONDARY STROKE PREVENTION INITIATIVE DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the main preventable cause of adult disability in the US. Stroke also disproportionately impacts the Hispanic population whose rapid growth and aging will lead to dramatic future increases in the public health impact of stroke. In the Hispanic Secondary Stroke Prevention Initiative we propose a translational research project aimed at reducing the risk for a recurrent stroke. Our focus is on patients having had a stroke since they have over a 25% risk of a recurrent and potentially much more debilitating stroke in the next five years. Our team is currently pursuing two important lines of research aimed at rigorously testing interventions to address disparities in a variety of other health conditions. On is Community Health Workers (CHW), a highly promising approach, for which evidence from RCTs is limited. Our group is also testing mobile health solutions among minorities. We propose to extend this work through a combined CHW/ ProMobile intervention. The study design will be a pragmatic clinical trial of 300 Latino patients in our stroke registry admitted with an acute ischemic stroke and having a moderate disability or less at time of discharge. The intervention will include CHW home visits, coaching phone calls, and group sessions. Cell phone based interactions will include blood pressure monitoring and tailored education messages. We will determine if the proposed intervention results in improving the most important recurrent stroke risk factor which is systolic blood pressure. We will also examine other risk factors including cholesterol, medication adherence, and among diabetic patients, glycemic control. A strength of our study is that it will leverage existing resources, including those of our recently funded strok disparities program and our CTSA. We expect that our translational research project will provide new insights on potential approaches to treatment that can transform medical practice to improve health outcomes in Latino stroke populations. Stroke is a leading cause of death and functional impairments. Stroke also disproportionately affects Latino populations. In the Hispanic Secondary Stroke Prevention Initiative we propose a study using Community Health Workers (CHW) and mobile phone technologies to reduce the risk for a recurrent stroke among Latinos at high risk for second and potentially much debilitating stroke. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is a leading cause of death and functional impairments and stroke risk factors (SRFs) disproportionately affect Latino populations. In the Hispanic Secondary Stroke Prevention Initiative (HiSSPI) we propose a study using Community Health Workers (CHW) and mobile technoloigies using cell phones to reducing the risk for a recurrent stroke among Latino stroke patients.

"Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly Stroke is a major public health problem in the United States. It is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of serious disability in adults. There are an estimated 800,000 strokes in the United States each year, with an estimated 7 million stroke survivors. Twenty percent of stroke survivors require institutional care after 3 months and 15%-30% are permanently disabled. Recurrent events, which occur in 185,000 stroke survivors in the United States each year, are associated with higher mortality rates, greater levels of disability, and increased costs as compared with first strokes. Stroke in adults is strongly age dependent, and the rate of adverse outcomes and complications associated with stroke increases with advanced age. Because the United States population is aging, the population at risk for stroke and recurrent events will increase over the coming decades. The high prevalence of stroke and its associated deficits impose a large burden on patients, their families, and the healthcare system. Optimizing post-acute care and secondary prevention efforts for stroke survivors represents an important target to reduce the burden of recurrent stroke, particularly among the elderly. Racial/ethnic and regional disparities have been identified for stroke incidence, prevalence, and mortality, but relatively little research has focused on potential disparities in the patterns of recurrent stroke events. The Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly study will use Medicare administrative data to achieve the following specific aims: 1) to assess temporal patterns in national recurrent stroke rates among elderly Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with ischemic stroke and describe disparities by sociodemographic and comorbid/clinical characteristics; and 2) to determine county-level rates of recurrent stroke, the persistence of geographic patterns over time, and county-level factors that may be contributing to disparities. Clinical practice, public policy, and reimbursement decisions are increasingly informed by data obtained from administrative datasets. The Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly study will be the largest contemporary investigation of recurrent stroke rates and patterns in the United States. Results from this project will identify geographic areas and subgroups that have distinctive health profiles that put them at high risk for recurrent stroke. Such information will inform care providers, insurers, public health agencies, and policy makers about communities that may derive the greatest benefit from targeted programs and community-based interventions. Results from the study will provide clinicians, investigators, and policymakers with national data on rates, trends, and patterns of recurrent stroke hospitalizations among the elderly, including variation among patient subgroups and geographic regions.",Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly,9524048,R01AG056628,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Aging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Progress Review Group ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' beneficiary ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' national surveillance ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention Guidelines ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' stroke survivor ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' racial minority ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' American Stroke Association ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke incidence ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' stroke outcome ', ' stroke event ', ' ']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,476037,0.4395792989166042
"Outcomes Among Surrogate decision makers In Stroke (OASIS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every day in hospitals across the country, patients with severe stroke and their families are faced with decisions about life-sustaining treatments in the initial hours of admission. These decisions about resuscitation status, invasive treatments, or possible transitions to comfort care are typically made by a surrogate decision- maker due to communication or cognitive deficits in the patient. This surrogate must consider the patient's life goals and values to determine if their loved one would choose on-going intensive treatments where they may survive and yet have long term disabilities, or prioritize comfort and accept the likelihood of an earlier death. Serving as a surrogate decision maker for a patient in the intensive care unit can have long lasting negative consequences. However, almost nothing is known about surrogate decision makers in diverse populations with stroke. Hispanic Americans are now the largest minority group in the US, rapidly growing and aging, with Mexican Americans comprising the largest subgroup. Multiple disparities have been identified in stroke incidence and outcome between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites, particularly in the use of life- sustaining treatments. Minority populations may be particularly vulnerable to inadequate communication about end-of-life issues due to socioeconomic disadvantage, poor health literacy, and lack of provider empathy and health system strategies to improve communication. However, Mexican American culture includes strong values of family support and religiosity that may have a positive influence on discussions about life-sustaining treatment and adapting to stroke-related disabilities. There is currently a critical gap in understanding the perspectives and outcomes of stroke surrogate decision makers, making it impossible to design interventions to help diverse populations of patients and families through this incredibly trying time. The aims of this proposal are 1) To assess physician quality of communication, shared decision-making, and quality of end-of-life care among stroke surrogate decision makers; and 2) To assess the long-term impact of serving as a surrogate decision maker for stroke and assess the unmet decision support needs of stroke surrogates. Results will be used to design future targeted decision support interventions for diverse populations of stroke patients and family members. This proposal takes advantage of the extensive established infrastructure of the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS038916), a population based epidemiological stroke surveillance study recently funded for its fourth 5-year cycle. New prospectively obtained data on surrogate decision-maker outcomes using established validated measures will be linked to BASIC's rich longitudinal patient-level data on functional outcome to maximize efficiency.

"Genetic evaluation of two novel loci associated with recurrent stroke Abstract Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and the number one cause of serious, long term disability. Of the nearly 800,000 annual strokes, approximately 25% will be recurrent events. Unfortunately, recurrent strokes are more deadly and most likely to cause disability when compared to a first stroke. Genetic studies focusing on recurrent stroke have been extremely limited. We have identified two novel gene regions associated with recurrent stroke and aim to use next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) to fine-map these regions to hone in on the likely causal variants. For 182 recurrent stroke patients from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) clinical trial, we will utilize NGS platforms to identify all genetic variants across 1.5 Mb spanning the two novel gene regions associated with recurrent stroke. High priority variants will be genotyped in all 2,100 VISP participants and analyzed for association with recurrent stroke. NGS is a cutting edge technology that provides a powerful approach to identify novel and important genetic contributors to recurrent stroke, a phenotype that has been poorly studied. This approach may allow improved personalization of risk assessment and targeted prevention. Moreover, VISP participants include both African Americans (AA) and European Americans, therefore this proposal may identify genetic risk variants specific to populations of African descent that might not otherwise be identified in other studies focused primarily on populations of European ancestry. These variants may help address why African Americans have nearly 2x greater risk of suffering a stroke, and are more likely to die following a stroke, as compared to European Americans. Furthermore, these findings may have broader implications by providing insight on other issues influencing recurrent stroke such as the ability to control manageable risk factors (e.g. hypertension and atrial fibrillation) and likewise one’s response to treatment for anticoagulation, antiplatelet, and antihypertensive medications. Moreover, these finding may reflect post stroke treatment response to tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only FDA approved treatment for ischemic stroke. Aligned with the goals of the NIH Academic Research Enhancement Award (AREA) Program (R15), we aim to explore a significant research question while exposing students to research, in particular learning cutting edge skills in Genomics, Population Genetics, Biotechnology techniques involving NGS library preparations, and Bioinformatics skills focused on analyzing NGS data and performing statistical analyses for genetic studies. Project Narrative: The goal of this proposal is to use cutting edge next generation DNA sequencing to identify genetic variants contributing to recurrent stroke risk. We will evaluate two novel gene regions identified in the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention clinical trial population. The successful completion of this project will provide insight into personalized risk assessment, targeted prevention, and response to treatment for stroke and recurrent stroke, ultimately reducing the huge health burdens of stroke.",Genetic evaluation of two novel loci associated with recurrent stroke,9599843,R15NS095115,"['Anticoagulation ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Hypotensives ', '

"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9389004,R01HL126700,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Apnea ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Sleep Apnea Syndromes ', ' sleep-related breathing disorder ', ' Sleep-Disordered Breathing ', ' Sleep Hypopnea ', ' Sleep Apnea ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' Pulse Rates ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Devices ', ' Autonomic Dysfunction ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' surveillance study ', ' screening ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' stroke survivor ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' Risk stratification ', ' patient screening ', ' stroke patient ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' stroke outcome ', ' stroke trials ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,734204,0.4811929638256092
"Family Study of Carotid Atherosclerosis and Stroke Risk Project Summary Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability in the US and disproportionally affects minority populations. Hispanics have a particularly high risk for stroke; this increased risk of stroke may be explained by specific genetic and non-genetic factors. Dominicans are the fastest growing Caribbean Hispanics in the US, and yet little is known about their genetic and non-genetic determinants of stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD). For the past 15 years, our team has been investigating stroke genetic risk factors in Dominicans. We have assembled a cohort of Dominican families at high risk of stroke and focused on stroke precursor phenotypes (SPPs) to reduce phenotypic heterogeneity and complexity of stroke etiology. We investigated well-recognized SPPs including carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, left ventricular mass, and left atrial diameter. We have successfully identified quantitative trait loci and DNA sequence variants associated with SPPs using high throughput genotyping and next generation sequencing. These findings account for a small portion of the inter- individual variation in SPPs. In this application, we propose to expand our investigations to conduct a methylome- wide-association-study (MWAS) to identify differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) associated with SPPs, stroke and CVD. Methylation is an epigenetic process that regulates gene expression without changing DNA sequence. DNA methylation has been shown as a key process contributing to the development of vascular disease. The proposed investigations would provide new insights relevant to the development of novel clinical strategies for prevention and treatment of stroke and CVD, as our ultimate goal is to reduce stroke risk and race- ethnic disparities in stroke and CVD. We plan 4 aims: Aim 1 to identify DMRs associated with stroke SPPs; Aim 2 to assess the relative contribution of genetic and non-genetic factors to SPP-associated DMRs; Aim3 to evaluate the functional impact of DNA sequence variation and DMRs using CRISPR-Cas9 technology; and Aim 4 to examine the predictive effect of SPP-associated DMRs on vascular events. To achieve these aims we will leverage the rich data already collected in the Family Study and add new data collection to detect vascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular death). We will validate the findings in an independent sample from the ongoing longitudinal Northern Manhattan Study, from which the Family Study originated. Both studies have used the same assessment tools and collection instruments for obtaining SPPs, lifestyle risk factors and genome-wide SNP data. The innovative aspects of our proposal include novel discoveries of modifiable epigenetic sites for stroke and CVD, CRISPR-Cas9 technology to model specific genome-editing, a unique population of Dominicans and a family study design, and an available independent population of Dominicans for validation studies. Findings from our study may lead to the most promising molecular strategies for risk stratification, prevention and treatment of stroke. Project Narrative Stroke is a major public health problem that disproportionally affects Hispanics. For over 15 years, we have been investigating genetic risk factors for stroke in Dominicans, one of the fastest growing sub-populations of Hispanics in the US. We propose an epigenetic study using our established Dominican cohorts.

"Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mexican Americans are the most numerous sub-group of Hispanic Americans, the largest minority population in the United States. This important group is aging and growing rapidly. For the past 14 years the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project has provided rich original stroke disparities research comparing Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. BASIC remains the only means to monitor stroke trends and to investigate stroke outcomes in Mexican Americans. BASIC has demonstrated that stroke incidence is higher in Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites. New stroke incidence data from BASIC show that the disparity remains completely unabated over the last decade. Further, stroke onset occurs at younger ages in Mexican Americans providing more years of disability. This contributes to a substantial increased cost for stroke in Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites. Remarkable new data from BASIC suggests that the previously seen Mexican American survival advantage post-stroke is disappearing. Further, Mexican American stroke survivors have worse neurologic and functional outcomes. Thus, BASIC data suggests that in 2013 Mexican Americans have more strokes, occurring at younger ages, and experience far greater post- stroke disability than non-Hispanic whites. The current proposal seeks to continue to provide rigorous stroke surveillance to monitor stroke trends in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We further propose to provide new longer-term (six month and one year) stroke outcome data to provide crucial information on the time course and changes in neurologic, functional, cognitive, and quality of life outcomes post-stroke in both ethnic groups. Additionally, since post-stroke disability appears much worse in Mexican Americans, we plan to delve deeply into the structure of informal caregiving post-stroke and understand the needs of stroke survivors and the role of families in addressing these needs. This data on the social/family context in which stroke survivors function will be crucial for designing intervention to improve stroke outcome. Finally, the definition of stroke will be studied to understand the impact on measures of stroke burden derived from an ethnically diverse population-based study. BASIC has published over 55 original, peer-reviewed manuscripts, spun-off 5 R-level grants and served as the foundation for training numerous diverse students. In this next cycle, we are poised and deeply committed to provide a fundamental understanding of long-term stroke trends, outcome studies, and informal caregiving structure, as well as continuing to provide key clinical observations such as the impact of the new stroke definition. This work is absolutely critical to Mexican Americans, a growing, aging and large minority population that will increasingly feel the impact from stroke in the next decade. Indeed, this work is also critical to clinicians and public health planners as BASIC continues to offer key observations on stroke and Mexican American health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to monitor and understand the tremendous stroke disparity among Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Stroke incidence, recurrence, mortality, and, in survivors, neurologic, functional and cognitive outcomes will be compared among the ethnic groups. Informal caregiving structure will be studied to improve services and tailor interventions for stroke survivors and families to improve stroke outcome and prevent second stroke.",Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project,9459765,R01NS038916,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Survivors ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' stroke recovery ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' Informal care giving ', ' informal caregiving ', ' stroke survivor ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' stroke intervention ', ' American Stroke Association ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke incidence ', ' stroke outcome ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,752340,0.35564741078733175
"Health Disparities in Sepsis as a Risk Factor for Stroke Project Summary Description: Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the US and the number one cause of severe long- term adult disability. In addition to initiatives dedicated to reducing morbidity and mortality associated with stroke outcomes, there are initiatives to reduce stroke risk factors at the community level. In order to reduce the burden of stroke on the population, identifying modifiable risk factors, and demonstrating the reduction of stroke risk through risk reduction efforts is a high priority. While much is known about long-term stroke risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerotic disease, much less is known about short-term risk factors, or triggers, for stroke. Infection, particularly severe infection, has been identified as a potential risk factor and trigger for stroke. The role of sepsis as a risk factor for stroke has not been well described. Our recent analyses of administrative datasets has identified sepsis as a risk factor for stroke, however, while there is a low absolute risk of stroke post sepsis, those who are at risk remain at risk up to a year after their sepsis event. Additionally, racial disparities in sepsis and stroke have been identified, with black patients twice as likely to develop sepsis or stroke as white patients. Prior research has found that even while adjusting for poverty or medically underserved areas, black patients remain at higher risk of both sepsis and stroke, indicating a link between racial and geographic disparities with sepsis and stroke. The role racial and geographic disparities play in the relationship between sepsis and subsequent risk of stroke is not well- understood. The overall goal of this project is to investigate sepsis as a risk factor for stroke and identify risk factors of sepsis patients that increase their risk of stroke. The proposed research will use data from the REGARDS study (2003-ongoing), a unique longitudinal, nationally representative sample of people with detailed information on prior stroke comorbidities, post-stroke comorbidities and long-term outcomes. Furthermore, an ancillary REGARDS study investigated sepsis hospitalizations, providing valuable information on sepsis hospitalizations that can be investigated as risk factors for stroke. Individual and community level characteristics will be investigated, as well as potential interactions that increase the risk post-sepsis for stroke. The proposed NINDS Small Research Grant will allow us to investigate the role of sepsis as a risk factor for stroke, and identify characteristics of sepsis patients at greatest risk for a stroke, which can aide in patient selection for future research on decreasing the risk of stroke post sepsis in at risk individuals. Project Narrative The overall goal of this project is to investigate the role of sepsis as a risk factor or trigger for stroke. The proposed research will use data from the REGARDS study and the REGARDS ancillary sepsis study (2003- ongoing, N=1,416), a unique longitudinal, nationally representative sample of people with detailed information on prior stroke comorbidities, post-stroke comorbidities and long-term outcomes.

"Program to Avoid Cerebrovascular Events Through Systematic Electronic Tracking and Tailoring of an Eminent Risk-factor (PACESETTER) Racial and rural-urban disparities in stroke care and outcomes are most prominent in the Southeastern region of the US, where 3 states have long been recognized as representing the `buckle' of a `stroke belt', i.e. highly stroke-prone tri-state area within a broader region already more heavily burdened with stroke compared to the rest of the country. One of these 3 states is South Carolina (SC). Fortunately, stroke is eminently preventable and hypertension (HTN) is the premier modifiable risk factor for stroke, but fewer than one third of patients with a recent stroke have their blood pressure (BP) controlled ≥75% of the time and low consistency of BP control is linked to higher risk of future major vascular events. Key factors responsible for uncontrolled HTN in African Americans (AA) are medication non-adherence and failure to intensify therapy in a timely manner. As such, culturally-tailored, efficacious blood pressure control programs which are acceptable, feasible, timely, and sustainable are needed, especially among hypertensive stroke survivors who reside in the stroke buckle or who are AA. Mobile health (mHealth) technology offers a promising approach to address this need. The overall objective of the Program to Avoid Cerebrovascular Events through Systematic Electronic Tracking and Tailoring of an Eminent Risk-factor (PACESETTER) study is to demonstrate that a theoretical-model- based, mHealth technology-centered, multi-level integrated approach can be effectively implemented to improve sustained BP control among stroke patients encountered in South Carolina (at least half of whom will be AA) within one month of stroke symptom onset. The primary aim is conduct an implementation trial (at the patient level) of the PACESETTER intervention [health technology (personalized phone text messaging and home BP monitoring)] vs. usual care in 200 recent stroke patients with hypertension recruited across the three main safety net hospitals in the state of SC (in the cities of Charleston, Columbia, and Greenville). Primary outcome will be achievement of guideline-recommended systolic blood pressure control at 12 months. We also aim to explore whether implementation of the PACESETTER intervention vs. standard care is associated with a reduction in subsequent cardiovascular event-related re-hospitalizations, shows a signal of potential efficacy in reducing actual vascular events, and has distinct effects on providers caring for patients with stroke. Altogether, the PACESETTER intervention, if proven effective and implementable, may eventually be exported to other medically underserved populations in the US beyond SC, as a feasible model of evidence-based post-stroke management. Stroke is a major public health problem leading to death, disability, and dementia. African Americans and people who live in the Southeastern region of the United States (US) experience a higher rate of stroke compared to people of other races and US regions; however, stroke is very preventable and adequately treating hypertension has the biggest effect on stroke prevention. This research seeks to test a mobile- phone and home monitoring based strategy for improving the currently poor control of hypertension among patients (half of whom will be African American) at high risk for future stroke in South Carolina, a State with an especially high rate of deaths from stroke.",Program to Avoid Cerebrovascular Events Through Systematic Electronic Tracking and Tailoring of an Eminent Risk-factor (PACESETTER),9568428,R01MD012441,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cities ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' indexing ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' South Carolina ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Self Management ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Rural ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' forgetting ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' pill ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Provider ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Home Blood Pressure Monitoring ', ' Self Blood Pressure Monitoring ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' systematic review ', ' implementation trial ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' virtual ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' willingness ', ' Prevalence ', ' safety net ', ' modifiable risk ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' hypertension management ', ' hypertension control ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke symptom ', ' urban disparity ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' practice setting ', ' Stroke Belt ', ' stroke patient ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke incidence ', ' ']",NIMHD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2018,541079,0.3845593478065048
"Disparities in Transition of Care after Acute Stroke Hospitalization: The Transition of Care Stroke Disparity Study (TCSD-S) Stroke, together with heart disease, accounts for the largest proportion of non-communicable diseases and deaths worldwide. In the US, there are 795,000 annual stroke cases and 150,000 deaths from stroke. Numbers will steeply increase with the aging population. Stroke remains the main cause of serious long-term disability with minorities being affected disproportionally. Greater risk of stroke exists among blacks and Hispanics at younger ages; blacks have greater stroke mortality. Though measures of quality of stroke care during acute hospitalization have improved, little evidence exists on the quality of processes leading to effective stroke prevention and rehabilitation after hospital discharge. Unexpected hospital readmissions 30 days after acute stroke hospitalization are common, as high as 25%, and lead to excess morbidity and cost. Stroke impact on patients', families', and communities' quality of life, and the burden on use and cost of health care is enormous. We propose the Transitions of Care Stroke Disparity Study (TCSD-S) with the main objective to identify race- ethnic and sex disparities in hospital-to-home transition of stroke care and outcomes, social determinants of health associated with these disparities, and to develop effective hospital-initiated system level initiatives to reduce disparities and readmissions, and to improve stroke outcomes. To achieve this objective, we will capitalize on the rich infrastructure and resources of our unique Florida Stroke Registry (FSR), which includes a well-developed network of hospitals, health providers, partnership with the AHA, and other Florida stakeholders. We will evaluate medication adherence, healthy lifestyle, utilization of rehabilitation interventions and medical follow-up 30 days after hospital discharge to home across representative Florida Comprehensive Stroke Centers. A novel Transitions of Stroke Care Performance Index (TOSC PI) will be derived and validated. Thi index will be a primary outcome together with hospital readmissions and stroke outcomes (disability, recurrence, cardiovascular events, and death). Data on TOSC and stroke outcomes will be collected by structured telephone interviews at 30 and 90 days after discharge and review of patient charts. Predictors of TOSC disparities and outcomes will be evaluated using baseline in-hospital data of the index stroke obtained from the FSR, and Social Determinants of Health obtained through a novel data collection instrument from publicly available records. Based on identified predictors of TOSC disparities, we will develop and assess the feasibility of initiatives to reduce TOSC disparities, targeting systems of care with a TOSC disparities dashboard, and health care providers with a training module for enhanced patient education and support at discharge and during follow-up. We will compare the TOSC PI and outcomes before and after the initiatives. The successful completion of this study will identify disparities in hospital-to-home TOSC, define key predictors of poor TOSC and stroke outcomes, and develop initiatives which will be scalable across health systems and which will address disparities, readmission rates, and poor outcomes. Project Narrative Despite improvements in the in-hospital treatment of acute stroke, readmissions, recurrent stroke, and disability remain common and affect minorities disproportionally as transition of care from hospital to home may be suboptimal. This project will define race/ethnic and sex disparities in transitions of care from hospital to home after stroke, identify modifiable factors, and develop initiatives that impact the health care system and educate health care providers to reduce disparities and improve outcomes after stroke. This project is relevant as it targets an understudied aspect of stroke care during transition of care from hospital to home, and may result in reductions of stroke recurrence, disability, readmissions, and disparities in care.  ",Disparities in Transition of Care after Acute Stroke Hospitalization: The Transition of Care Stroke Disparity Study (TCSD-S),9572944,R01MD012467,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Family ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Records ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Registries ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' stroke rehab ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Survivors ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' instrument ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' rehabilitation service ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Drops ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' primary outcome ', ' social health determinants ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' improved outcome ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' disparities in sex ', ' sex disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' dashboard ', ' readmission rates ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' American Stroke Association ', ' stroke patient ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' stroke outcome ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,724673,0.42673839789451945
"Reducing Racial Disparities in Post-Stroke Disability in the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is common, nearly 800,000 strokes occur annually, and a leading cause of disability in the U.S. Non-Hispanic Black/African American (Black) adults have the highest stroke prevalence and suffer the most post-stroke disability of any U.S. racial/ethnic group. Even though racial disparities in post-stroke disability are widespread, little it is known about how to reduce this disparity. Racial differences in disability arise in the post-stroke period; however it is unclear if these differences arise shortly after strke in the early recovery period, when many stroke survivors are undergoing rehabilitation, or after stroke survivors return to the community. This project will address the critical questions of when racial disparities in post-stroke disability arise and determine the drivers of this disparity in ech period. Answering these questions is an essential step to designing interventions to improve health in Black stroke survivors and reduce disparities. To address these questions, we will rely on the newly available National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) linked to Medicare claims and functional assessment data. NHATS is a national, longitudinal survey of Medicare beneficiaries focused on understanding the causes and consequences of disability in the elderly. NHATS performs annual face-to-face interviews to carefully characterize disability in the elderly and measures a vast array of disability predictors including social, community and disability accommodation factors. Additionally NHATS's linkage to Medicare claims will enable measurement of important medical and rehabilitation factors that may also explain racial differences in post-stroke disability. These data sources will be used to develop the first comprehensive measures of rehabilitation intensity across all rehabilitation settings-home health, outpatient, skilled nursing and inpatient rehabilitation-compare intensity by race and estimate the effect of rehabilitation intensity on disability disparities. At the completion of the study, the timing and drivers of race differences in post-stroke disability will be identified. Furthermore, our novel measures of rehabilitation intensity can serve as a prototype for use in studying the role of rehabilitation in other diseases such as traumatic brain injury and arthritis. This proposal is particularly responsive to the NIMHD solicitation in that it focuses on modifiable drivers of racial differences in post-stroke disability from a policy standpoint and will directly inform stroke survivor and family level strategies to reduce disability and decrease disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-Hispanic Black/African American (Black) adults have more strokes and experience greater disability after their strokes than non-Hispanic White adults. Using newly available data, this project will determine the time when racial differences in post-stroke disability arise and the factors that lead to racial differences in post- stroke disabiity. These results will be directly used to develop strategies and interventions to improve the health of Black stroke survivors and reduce disparities.",Reducing Racial Disparities in Post-Stroke Disability in the Elderly,9454172,R01MD008879,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Arthritis ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Attention ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Home Health Agency ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Skilled Nursing Facilities ', ' Extended Care Facilities ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' trend ', ' Modification ', ' beneficiary ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' community living ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' Medicare claim ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' stroke survivor ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' outpatient center ', ' out-patient facility ', ' outpatient facility ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke incidence ', ' stroke outcome ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,387500,0.22415093848868395
"Examining Racial Disparities in Stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the 4th leading cause of US mortality and 3rd among African Americans, with African Americans exhibiting more than twice the risk of Whites. The underlying causes of racial disparities in stroke are unclear. Few studies have systematically evaluated how racial disparities in stroke might vary by socioeconomic and behavior risk factors (e.g. measures of socioeconomic status [SES], adiposity, physical activity and alcohol) and they might explain the observed disparities through their roles as intermediates in the causal pathway between race and stroke. There has been a paucity of research on the impact of socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors in stroke risk prediction. Moreover, validation of existing stroke prediction scores among African Americans is urgently needed. This innovative project will address these gaps in the literature by: (1) determining whether racial disparities in stroke and the associations of selected stroke risk factors by race are comparable in two biracial socioeconomically heterogeneous populations, (2) determining whether mediation by socioeconomic and behavioral stroke risk factors account for racial disparities in stroke beyond traditional stroke risk factors using conventional and causal frameworks, and (3) examining whether race-specific stroke prediction models improve the predictive performance (calibration and discrimination) of long-term stroke risk compared to existing stroke prediction models. These aims will be accomplished through the use of three multi-racial, well-established NIH-funded cohorts; the Women's Health Initiative, Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) and Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke.  A comprehensive approach to examining racial disparities will be utilized. Novel causal mediation analyses will complement conventional epidemiologic methods and move the field forward. Furthermore, race-specific stroke prediction models will enable the development of improved prevention strategies among at-risk individuals. These socioeconomic and behavioral stroke risk factors are often routinely collected in the clinic or could be obtained at minimal cost. This grant will generate new knowledge and crucial training for my advancement to become an independent epidemiologist in the field of racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) by developing my expertise in (1) racial disparities and social determinant of CVD; (2) statistical training in mediation analyses; (3) methodologic training in prediction modeling; (4) data management and analytic skills with Medicare claims data (CMS) for stroke ascertainment in SCCS and (5) pilot medical record collection for stroke validation in SCCS. The advanced training, mentorship and protected time provided by this career development award will provide the skills and experience necessary for conducting the highest quality racial/ethnic cardiovascular disparities research and a strong foundation for success as an independent epidemiologic racial/disparities investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the 4th leading cause of US mortality and 3rd among African Americans, with African Americans exhibiting more than twice the risk of Whites. This proposal will increase our understanding of differences in risk of stroke by race, providing insight into new approaches for prevention and elimination of racial disparities in stroke. By examining the contribution of socioeconomic and behavioral stroke risk factors (measures of SES, adiposity, physical activity and alcohol) to racial disparities in stroke, this proposal will advance knowledge and suggest target areas to decrease disparities, while the limitations of existing prediction scores will be addressed by the development of race-specific risk models which may assist in prevention strategies.",Examining Racial Disparities in Stroke,9486989,K01HL124391,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' systolic hypertension ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Smoking History ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' causal diagram ', ' causal model ', ' Data Analytics ', ' biracial ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' stroke event ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2018,178200,0.4368614940776495
"Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly Stroke is a major public health problem in the United States, with an estimated 800,000 strokes each year and an estimated 7 million stroke survivors. It is the third leading cause of death in women and the fifth leading cause in men. Twenty percent of stroke survivors require institutional care after 3 months and 15%-30% are permanently disabled. Stroke in adults is strongly age dependent. Because the United States population is aging, the population at risk for stroke will increase over the coming decades, and women will outnumber men in terms of stroke events. Another important shift in the US demographics is the increase of women of color, projected to increase from 36 percent to 53 percent of the total US female population. Improving stroke surveillance to fill important knowledge gaps in the burden of stroke for understudied, underrepresented, and underreported subgroups of women is critical to identify strategies to lessen the burden of stroke for women. This administrative supplement will build upon the Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly parent R01 grant to assess stroke rates and outcomes for fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. Medicare administrative data will be used to achieve the following specific aims: 1) To describe patterns in stroke hospitalizations and outcomes for women in understudied racial/ethnic minority groups and geographic regions among elderly Medicare beneficiaries; and 2) To describe patterns of stroke rates and outcomes according to dual-eligible Medicare-Medicaid status and geographic region. Our proposed study will address research priorities identified by the NIH Strategic Plan for Women’s Health Research to develop information systems for collecting, sharing, and comparing clinical data for diseases and conditions of women as well as to examine health disparities among women stemming from differences in race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The study also addresses priorities identified by the National Institute on Aging, the Institute of Medicine, and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to develop surveillance systems to understand the continuum of disease prevention, progression, treatment, and outcomes, particularly for vulnerable populations. Clinical practice, public policy, and reimbursement decisions are increasingly informed by administrative datasets. This study will be the most comprehensive and rigorous investigation to date aimed at describing stroke rates and outcomes among women from understudied, underrepresented, and underreported populations, including Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, and Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders. The study will also examine the stroke rates and outcomes among elderly Medicare-Medicaid beneficiaries, one of the most socioeconomically vulnerable populations in the US healthcare system. Such information is needed to inform the clinical management of women and underserved subgroups of patients with stroke. Results from the study will provide clinicians, investigators, and policymakers with the most comprehensive national data to date on stroke rates and outcomes among women from understudied, underrepresented, and underreported populations.",Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly,9911542,R01AG056628,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', '

"Mechanisms underlying race disparities in gastrostomy placement after stroke Project Summary/Abstract Racial differences in the utilization of therapeutic procedures in stroke patients are pervasive and contribute to worse outcomes in minorities compared to whites after stroke. Swallowing dysfunction immediately after stroke is common, but most patients recover adequate swallowing function within a few days or weeks. Percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) tubes for enteral feeding are commonly placed for patients who are perceived unlikely to recover adequate swallowing function in a timely manner, but ideally are avoided as PEG placement is invasive, carries the risk of procedure-related complications, and has been associated with poor long-term outcomes. Clinical decision-making surrounding PEG placement lacks objective and standardized criteria, but is largely dependent on clinical swallowing evaluations by Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) providers, and use of ancillary radiographic swallow studies such as a videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS). The PI’s preliminary data show that PEG tubes are overutilized in minorities compared to whites despite similar stroke severity, medical comorbidities, and incidence of swallowing dysfunction. The research proposed in the current application will investigate the potential mechanisms underlying racial disparities in PEG tube placement after stroke by thoroughly addressing the various care processes involved in evaluation of swallowing recovery and decision-making regarding PEG placement. The specific aims are (1) to investigate whether access to SLP services including frequency of bedside swallow evaluations and VFSS testing differs among black and white stroke patients, (2) to determine the presence of an unconscious (implicit) racial bias and its effect on PEG decision-making among SLP providers, and (3) to assess whether patient-SLP provider communication behavior during bedside swallow evaluations differs between race-concordant (white patient, white SLP provider), and race-discordant (black patient, white SLP provider) patient-SLP provider pairs. This project is proposed as part of a career development plan for the PI, a cerebrovascular neurologist, to obtain training in methodology related to the study of implicit bias, patient-provider communication, and advanced statistical methods. The training program and the mentoring team the PI has assembled will help to elucidate important mechanisms underlying racial disparities in PEG placement after stroke, position him to apply the newly acquired skill set to investigate implicit bias and patient-provider communication behavior as the underlying mechanisms of other disparities in stroke care, and allow him to develop strategies aimed at mitigating disparities in stroke care via future interventional studies as he transitions to become an independent clinical investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Racial differences in the utilization of inpatient procedures, such as gastrostomy tubes, are common after stroke, and contribute to worse health outcomes among minorities compared to whites. The aim of this study is to understand the mechanisms underlying overutilization of gastrostomy tubes in black compared to white stroke patients, specifically to elucidate the role of differential access to Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) care, implications of implicit race bias among SLP providers, and patient-provider communication behavior.

"Built environments on stroke risk and stroke disparities in a national sample ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and a top cause of serious long-term disability. A number of stroke risk factors have been established at the individual-level; however, these risk factors only partially explain stroke risk and account for only half of the racial disparities in stroke. Novel exposures of stroke risk must be identifie to improve our understanding of stroke risk and to develop effective interventions. Recently, built and social environments (BSEs) have been identified as important factors to examine to further our understanding of cardiovascular disease. However, to date no studies have examined the effect of BSEs on stroke risk. BSEs may also help to explain the large racial and geographic disparities in stroke rates although this has yet to be empirically examined nationally. The proposed study would address these gaps by utilizing a unique assembled cohort, namely the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. The REGARDS cohort is a national sample of adults over age 45, with oversamples of African-American participants and persons in the stroke belt. The proposed study will expand the REGARDS study to examine the effects of BSEs on incident stroke risk and on racial and geographic disparities in stroke. These aims will be achieved by obtaining data on a broad range of BSE characteristics of the REGARDS participants' built environment (e.g., food availability, park availability, food prices, physical activity facility availability, land use, steet connectivity and neighborhood physical environment) and participants' social environment (objective crime, perceived crime, neighborhood SES, social cohesion, racial residential segregation, social support and social networks, and neighborhood social environment). The data will be obtained from a number of sources including secondary commercial and administrative sources, participant self-reports and primary audits using the Street View feature in Google Earth. Environmental data will be spatially linked to participant data of the REGARDS case-cohort study. The proposed study aims to 1) examine the extent to which BSEs contribute to incident stroke risk in the REGARDS study; and 2) determine the extent to which BSEs explain racial and geographic disparities in incident stroke. The proposed study builds on important preliminary studies and the extensive relevant experience of the investigative team, which includes prominent scholars across a number of institutions. The proposed research provides a cost-effective way to examine the importance of BSEs for stroke prevention across diverse community settings and racial groups. Identifying the BSE characteristics that are predictive of incident stroke and BSEs that contribute to racial and geographic disparities will help inform future modifications of environments to improve population health. At the end of the study period, the BSE data will be made available to others through the REGARDS data sharing protocols; thus the measures in the proposed study will be available to the greater scientific community for use in research pertaining to other disease outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is a leading cause of death and serious long-term disability. The goal of this study is to identify salient built and social environmental factors tht are associated with risk of incident stroke and how those factors contribute to racial and geographical disparities in stroke.

"Acute Ischemic Stroke Neuroprotection Platform to overcome Care Disparities for Rural Populations Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) results from a blood clot in the neurovasculature. AIS is the 5th leading cause of death in the United States (US) and is the leading cause of neurological disability. AIS will strike more than 700,000 Americans in 2018 and, despite recent advances in stroke care, there remains a 65% chance of death or severe disability. By 2030, it is expected that the AIS economic burden will exceed $180B in the US alone. Standard-of-care AIS therapies include the use of thrombolysis within 4.5 hours of stroke onset and thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions as early as possible. However, despite thrombectomy’s proven value, poor access to early thrombectomy for rural populations still results in large disparities in care.  In the US, thrombectomies are largely performed at one of nearly 170 Comprehensive Stroke Centers (CSCs). Because considerable costs are associated with setting up and maintaining a CSC, these centers are concentrated near highly-populated urban centers, which can provide larger patient volumes. However, the consequence is that more than half of Americans face transfer times longer than an hour, and for rural AIS victims, who represent nearly a quarter of the US population, transfer delays can exceed two hours. As a result, neurological outcomes for rural AIS victims tend to be worse. While neuroprotective agents are a potentially powerful tool in preserving brain during long transfers, they have yet to be proven effective in clinical studies. One reason for this discrepancy is that the occlusive blood clot results in restrictive hemodynamics which prevent neuroprotectants from effectively reaching the ischemic region near and around the clot. If this hemodynamic limitation were overcome, the benefit to rural populations would be profound.  UN&UP has invented a novel nanoparticle-based mobile-health platform which overcomes adverse stroke- associated hemodynamics so that neuroprotective agents are better delivered to the ischemic volume. The technology conveys iron oxide nanoparticles into the blood flow-deprived region of ischemia using a mode of action that is efficacious for conjugated and unconjugated drugs. Importantly, the system is affordable and designed to travel with the AIS victim during transfer. While conjugation of the neuroprotectant promises to substantially improve efficacy, regulatory discussions support that the technology could be first regulated under the CDRH if therapeutics are unconjugated. The team reflects magnetics, robotics, nanoparticle, stroke, and neuroprotection experts, who have demonstrated prior commercial successes. The Phase I effort focuses on proof of concept of the platform. The aims include 1) prototype workstation construction, 2) prototype coated iron oxide particle formulation, 3) in vitro large-vessel occlusion phantom efficacy studies using CTA/MRA stroke datasets, and 4) in vivo efficacy and safety assessments using a known AIS animal model. Prior to Phase II, an FDA meeting is planned to inform the regulatory pathway. In Phase II, the best neuroprotectant agents will be identified and compared, and biocompatibility studies will be conducted. Acute ischemic stroke is the fifth leading cause of death and the leading cause of neurological disability, with more than 700,000 Americans stricken each year. Because transfer times to thrombectomy-capable stroke centers, which are located near or in highly-populated urban centers, can take more than two hours for rural populations, neurological outcomes are disproportionately worse as compared to urban-concentrated populations. For this Phase I proposal, UN&UP (short for “Unmet Needs and Underserved Populations”) will develop a magnetism-based mobile-health neuroprotection platform that overcomes the restrictive hemodynamics formed as a consequence of the occlusive clot so that neuroprotective agents are better delivered into the ischemic volume, therefore preserving and protecting the brain during long transfers for rural patients.",Acute Ischemic Stroke Neuroprotection Platform to overcome Care Disparities for Rural Populations,9794241,R43MD014092,"['Aging ', ' Ambulances ', ' Animals ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood coagulation ', ' Blood Clotting ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Ischemic Encephalopathy ', ' Brain Ischemia ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Collateral Blood Circulation ', ' Collateral Circulation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dyes ', ' Embolus ', ' Embolism ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' cGMP ', ' Guanosine Cyclic Monophosphate ', ' Cyclic GMP ', ' Half-Life ', ' Heating ', ' hemodynamics ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Ischemia ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patients ', ' Photomicrography ', ' Publishing ', ' Remote Operation (Robotics) ', ' Robotics ', ' Rural Population ', ' Safety ', ' Tridymite ', ' Silica ', ' Sand ', ' Cristobalite ', ' Silicon Dioxide ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Tail ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Veins ', ' Work ', ' Xrays ', ' X-Rays Radiation ', ' X-Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' red iron oxide ', ' ferric oxide ', ' colcothar ', ' Fe oxide ', ' iron oxide ', ' Fluorescein ', ' paraformaldehyde ', ' paraform ', ' Measures ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Thrombectomy ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Vial device ', ' Vial ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' disability ', ' Blood flow ', ' Rural ', ' Neuroprotective Agents ', ' Neuroprotective Drugs ', ' Neuroprotectants ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Intravenous ', ' Torque ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' brain tissue ', ' thrombolysis ', ' meetings ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic ', ' magnetic field ', ' American ', ' biomaterial compatibility ', ' biocompatibility ', ' particle ', ' Performance ', ' phantom model ', ' success ', ' animal data ', ' neuroprotection ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Devices ', ' Health Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' stroke therapy ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke treatment ', ' magnetite ferrosoferric oxide ', ' magnetite ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Coagulation ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Harvest ', ' Regulatory Pathway ', ' in vivo ', ' Filament ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanoparticle ', ' nanosized particle ', ' nano-sized particle ', ' nano particle ', ' rural disparities ', ' cost effective ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Population ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' standard of care ', ' safety testing ', ' arm ', ' operation ', ' three-arm study ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' Magnetic nanoparticles ', ' crystallinity ', ' Formulation ', ' neurovascular ', ' neuro-vascular ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' efficacy study ', ' rural patients ', ' rural underserved ', ' preservation ', ' stroke victims ', ' stroke event ', ' nanoparticle delivery ', ' nanoparticle delivered ', ' nano particle delivery ', ' iron oxide nanoparticle ', ' iron oxide nano particle ', ' safety assessment ', ' off-patent ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNANDUP, LLC",R43,2019,279826,0.19737810000180725
"Program to Avoid Cerebrovascular Events Through Systematic Electronic Tracking and Tailoring of an Eminent Risk-factor (PACESETTER) Racial and rural-urban disparities in stroke care and outcomes are most prominent in the Southeastern region of the US, where 3 states have long been recognized as representing the `buckle' of a `stroke belt', i.e. highly stroke-prone tri-state area within a broader region already more heavily burdened with stroke compared to the rest of the country. One of these 3 states is South Carolina (SC). Fortunately, stroke is eminently preventable and hypertension (HTN) is the premier modifiable risk factor for stroke, but fewer than one third of patients with a recent stroke have their blood pressure (BP) controlled ≥75% of the time and low consistency of BP control is linked to higher risk of future major vascular events. Key factors responsible for uncontrolled HTN in African Americans (AA) are medication non-adherence and failure to intensify therapy in a timely manner. As such, culturally-tailored, efficacious blood pressure control programs which are acceptable, feasible, timely, and sustainable are needed, especially among hypertensive stroke survivors who reside in the stroke buckle or who are AA. Mobile health (mHealth) technology offers a promising approach to address this need. The overall objective of the Program to Avoid Cerebrovascular Events through Systematic Electronic Tracking and Tailoring of an Eminent Risk-factor (PACESETTER) study is to demonstrate that a theoretical-model- based, mHealth technology-centered, multi-level integrated approach can be effectively implemented to improve sustained BP control among stroke patients encountered in South Carolina (at least half of whom will be AA) within one month of stroke symptom onset. The primary aim is conduct an implementation trial (at the patient level) of the PACESETTER intervention [health technology (personalized phone text messaging and home BP monitoring)] vs. usual care in 200 recent stroke patients with hypertension recruited across the three main safety net hospitals in the state of SC (in the cities of Charleston, Columbia, and Greenville). Primary outcome will be achievement of guideline-recommended systolic blood pressure control at 12 months. We also aim to explore whether implementation of the PACESETTER intervention vs. standard care is associated with a reduction in subsequent cardiovascular event-related re-hospitalizations, shows a signal of potential efficacy in reducing actual vascular events, and has distinct effects on providers caring for patients with stroke. Altogether, the PACESETTER intervention, if proven effective and implementable, may eventually be exported to other medically underserved populations in the US beyond SC, as a feasible model of evidence-based post-stroke management. Stroke is a major public health problem leading to death, disability, and dementia. African Americans and people who live in the Southeastern region of the United States (US) experience a higher rate of stroke compared to people of other races and US regions; however, stroke is very preventable and adequately treating hypertension has the biggest effect on stroke prevention. This research seeks to test a mobile- phone and home monitoring based strategy for improving the currently poor control of hypertension among patients (half of whom will be African American) at high risk for future stroke in South Carolina, a State with an especially high rate of deaths from stroke.",Program to Avoid Cerebrovascular Events Through Systematic Electronic Tracking and Tailoring of

"VCID and Stroke in a Bi-racial National Cohort PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia and stroke are substantially higher among blacks aged 45+, and among residents of the southeastern region of the US. The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study is national, longitudinal cohort study of ~ 30,000 blacks and whites designed to advance the understanding of the epidemiology of cognitive decline and stroke, and the contributors to racial and geographic disparities in these outcomes. The current application has three aims:  1. Identify social, cardiovascular, and environmental mechanisms of racial and geographic  disparities in incident vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID).  With assessment in mid-life and over a decade of longitudinal cognitive data, REGARDS is  uniquely positioned to identify vascular, social, and behavioral mechanisms underlying  disparities in VCID, and modifiable pathways on which interventions may narrow disparities  in VCID. After completion of a nested calibration/confirmation study to develop an algorithm  for the classification of MCI and dementia, we will characterize racial and geographic  disparities in VCID and determine if interventions on mediators would diminish or eliminate disparities.  2. Answer as-yet-unanswered questions in stroke and cerebrovascular disease epidemiology.  By continuing the successful approaches for stroke surveillance among 17000 active cohort  members, the study will assess the association of risk factor changes and novel biomarkers  quantified with the completion of the second in-person exam with stroke risk and disparities  in stroke risk. In addition, with the aging of the cohort, this aim will provide greatly needed  information on stroke epidemiology in the elderly.  3. Utilize incident risk factor data and biospecimens to identify pathways for development of  incident hypertension and diabetes, with the goal of understanding the impact on incident  VCID and stroke. We have documented that ≈30% of the racial disparity in stroke risk is  attributable to racial disparities in prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, and the study  will investigate the biomarker pathways contributing to the higher incidence of hypertension  and diabetes in blacks.  Each proposed aim addresses a topic of profound public health impact, and REGARDS  progress to date uniquely positions the study to address these aims using proven approaches  in an efficient manner.     Relevance    Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia and stroke are substantially higher among blacks aged 45 and older, and among persons who live in the southeastern region of the US. The reasons for these higher rates are poorly understood. Analyses of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and stroke from a national US cohort including persons with and without MCI, dementia, and stroke will help guide interventions to reduce these disparities.",VCID and Stroke in a Bi-racial National Cohort,9646392,U01NS041588,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Age Distribution ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' literacy ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Persons ', ' Paper ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Work ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Visit ', ' age group ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Vascular Cognitive Impairment ', ' vascular\xa0cognitive decline ', ' vascular contributions to cognitive impairment ', ' vascular cognitive dysfunction ', ' vascular cognitive disease ', ' vascular cognition impairment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' black/white disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' vascular cognitive impairment and dementia ', ' vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia ', ' vascular contributions to cognition/dementia ', ' cardiac disease induced cognitive impairment ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' stroke risk ', ' risk of stroke ', ' risk for stroke ', ' stroke event ', ' classification algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2019,5360870,0.2939043282381637
"Metabolomic predictors of stroke in REGARDS Abstract There is a disproportionate burden of stroke among African Americans (AA) and individuals in the Southeastern United States, although the environmental and/or genetic underpinnings remain incompletely defined. Because metabolites integrate both environmental and genetic factors, they serve as proximal markers of human disease. In prior work supported by a Career Development Award, we established a rapid, multifunctional metabolomics platform that can be applied to large epidemiological cohorts. We now seek to focus our study on the metabolite predictors of cerebrovascular disease, an area that has received relatively little attention. To address these gaps in knowledge, we propose conducting metabolomics in stroke in the multiethnic REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke ( REGARDS) study, with further replication in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) and Framingham Heart Study (FHS). We will test the overarching hypothesis that metabolomics in well-phenotyped populations will illuminate stroke-associated metabolite pathways, and unravel racial differences among them. In Aim 1, we will identify metabolite risk factors for incident stroke, stratified by subtype, in the case-control cohort of the REGARDS study. We will profile metabolites from the baseline examination in ~1200 incident stroke cases and ~1200 controls matched for age, sex and race. In Aim 2, we will identify novel metabolite markers of known clinical risk traits for stroke, including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diet and exercise. In Aim 3, we will validate novel metabolite predictors of incident stroke and associated risk traits in the JHS and FHS cohorts. We will also test whether genetic variants that determine metabolite levels are in turn associated with clinical traits, through genetic risk score analysis. With extensive study data, the REGARDS study is uniquely positioned to catalyze the Aims of this proposal. Leveraging a novel small molecule profiling platform, our preliminary studies demonstrate the feasibility and significance of the Aims. Our multidisciplinary collaboration includes investigators at the MGH, UAB and University of Cincinnati, who bring collective expertise in metabolite profiling, biomarkers, genetic and population epidemiology, bioinformatics, metabolic traits, and health disparities. Finally, all data will be made publicly available, producing a unique scientific resource for the stroke research community. Narrative There are geographic and racial disparities in the burden of stroke across the United States. In this proposal, we will apply novel metabolite profiling techniques developed by our group to test the hypothesis that metabolomics will illuminate stroke-associated markers and unravel racial differences in that risk. These efforts have the potential to improve our ability to identify individuals at risk for stroke and improve the understanding of underlying mechanisms of disease.",Metabolomic predictors of stroke

"Family Study of Carotid Atherosclerosis and Stroke Risk Project Summary Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability in the US and disproportionally affects minority populations. Hispanics have a particularly high risk for stroke; this increased risk of stroke may be explained by specific genetic and non-genetic factors. Dominicans are the fastest growing Caribbean Hispanics in the US, and yet little is known about their genetic and non-genetic determinants of stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD). For the past 15 years, our team has been investigating stroke genetic risk factors in Dominicans. We have assembled a cohort of Dominican families at high risk of stroke and focused on stroke precursor phenotypes (SPPs) to reduce phenotypic heterogeneity and complexity of stroke etiology. We investigated well-recognized SPPs including carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, left ventricular mass, and left atrial diameter. We have successfully identified quantitative trait loci and DNA sequence variants associated with SPPs using high throughput genotyping and next generation sequencing. These findings account for a small portion of the inter- individual variation in SPPs. In this application, we propose to expand our investigations to conduct a methylome- wide-association-study (MWAS) to identify differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) associated with SPPs, stroke and CVD. Methylation is an epigenetic process that regulates gene expression without changing DNA sequence. DNA methylation has been shown as a key process contributing to the development of vascular disease. The proposed investigations would provide new insights relevant to the development of novel clinical strategies for prevention and treatment of stroke and CVD, as our ultimate goal is to reduce stroke risk and race- ethnic disparities in stroke and CVD. We plan 4 aims: Aim 1 to identify DMRs associated with stroke SPPs; Aim 2 to assess the relative contribution of genetic and non-genetic factors to SPP-associated DMRs; Aim3 to evaluate the functional impact of DNA sequence variation and DMRs using CRISPR-Cas9 technology; and Aim 4 to examine the predictive effect of SPP-associated DMRs on vascular events. To achieve these aims we will leverage the rich data already collected in the Family Study and add new data collection to detect vascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular death). We will validate the findings in an independent sample from the ongoing longitudinal Northern Manhattan Study, from which the Family Study originated. Both studies have used the same assessment tools and collection instruments for obtaining SPPs, lifestyle risk factors and genome-wide SNP data. The innovative aspects of our proposal include novel discoveries of modifiable epigenetic sites for stroke and CVD, CRISPR-Cas9 technology to model specific genome-editing, a unique population of Dominicans and a family study design, and an available independent population of Dominicans for validation studies. Findings from our study may lead to the most promising molecular strategies for risk stratification, prevention and treatment of stroke. Project Narrative Stroke is a major public health problem that disproportionally affects Hispanics. For over 15 years, we have been investigating genetic risk factors for stroke in Dominicans, one of the fastest growing sub-populations of Hispanics in the US.

"Reducing stroke risk in African-American men PROJECT SUMMARY  The burden of stroke among US adults is the fifth leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability, costing an estimated $19 billion. African-Americans (AA) have substantially higher stroke rates, compared to any other racial-ethnic group. Compared to whites, AA have greater stroke disability, more post- stroke complications, and slower recovery. Racial disparities in stroke outcomes are particularly high among AA men. Unfortunately, there is only a limited literature that has specifically focused on improving post-stroke care for AA men stroke survivors. Written In response to NIH PA-13-328: Health Promotion among Racial and Ethnic Minority Males (R01), the proposed project will test a curriculum-guided self-management support approach, TargEted MAnageMent (TEAM) focused specifically on AA men at high risk for stroke. TEAM is a group-format, nurse and patient co-led intervention focused on patient and family needs, practice in problem- solving, and attention to emotional and role management. The project builds upon promising pilot data from 2 previous R21 projects using TEAM. Novel project aspects include the: 1) Focus on AA men, 2) Use of Peer Dyads (stroke survivors and their care partners) as a key intervention component, 3) Use of curriculum-driven self-management, which has rarely been used in studies of AA men, and 4) Investigation of mechanistic factors that may help explain the most salient experimental elements of TEAM.  Work by this study team in the landmark Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) suggests that intensive efforts to reduce blood pressure (BP) to appropriate target ranges can reduce acute events like stroke, and that the proposed study site is an ideal recruitment environment with invested key personnel, and supportive infrastructure to conduct a rigorous evaluation of the TEAM approach in high-risk AA men. The proposed project is a 6-month prospective randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of TEAM vs. wait- list (WL) control in AA men who have experienced a stroke or TIA within the past 5 years. The primary outcome is change in systolic BP, while secondary outcomes include diastolic BP, cholesterol, triglycerides and glycemic control for individuals with diabetes. An exploratory analysis will evaluate posited mechanistic attitudinal targets (stroke knowledge, self-efficacy, perceived social support) as well as proximal behaviors to reduce stroke risk including diet, exercise, smoking, and tobacco/substance use. A complementary qualitative assessment will evaluate the perspective of TEAM and WL participants. If pilot results can be confirmed, TEAM represents a practical approach suitable for broad scale-up, with the potential to reverse the unacceptably high morbidity seen in AA men due to stroke.

"Left Atrial abNormality, ThromboEmbolism, and Race: Novel risk factors for stroke (LANTERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  African Americans face a two-fold higher risk of ischemic stroke than white residents of the U.S. The reasons for this black-white stroke disparity are not completely known. This proposal seeks to identify whether atrial cardiopathy, a novel risk factor, partly explains the higher stroke risk in blacks. Compared to whites, blacks experience less atrial fibrillation, a heart-rhythm disorder that is one of the strongest known risk factors for stroke. In the prevailing clinical paradigm, it is thought that atrial fibrillation is required for blood clots to form in the heart's left atrium, from where they can embolize to the brain and cause stroke. However, recent research indicates that embolization from the left atrium can occur when there are abnormalities in atrial tissue and function—a condition referred to as atrial cardiopathy—regardless of whether there is atrial fibrillation. Preliminary data suggest that atrial cardiopathy manifests differently in blacks than whites: more often with left atrial abnormality on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and less often with atrial fibrillation or its typical accompaniment, left atrial enlargement on an echocardiogram. As a result, atrial thromboembolism may often go unrecognized in blacks because it occurs in the absence of atrial fibrillation and atrial enlargement. The proposed research will test the central hypothesis that currently unexplained disparities in stroke between whites and blacks can be partly explained by differences in the manifestation of atrial cardiopathy. This application is for an ancillary study to the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study and the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study (GCNKSS). REGARDS is a longitudinal cohort study that seeks to shed light on the relationship between baseline risk factors and future stroke in >30,000 black and white individuals. GCNKSS is a population-based epidemiological study of racial disparities in the incidence and outcomes of stroke in a biracial population of 1.3 million. Taking advantage of the complementary designs of these studies, the proposed research will first determine the relationship between baseline ECG-defined left atrial abnormality, race, and future stroke in REGARDS. It will then determine black-white differences in GCNKSS in markers that signify a potential atrial thromboembolic cause of stroke. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypotheses that blacks have a higher prevalence of left atrial abnormality, that left atrial abnormality is associated with future stroke, and that left atrial abnormality contributes to the higher stroke risk in blacks. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypotheses that black patients with ischemic stroke more often have ECG-defined left atrial abnormality and less often have echocardiographic left atrial enlargement than whites. All ECGs and a subset of echocardiogram images will be centrally interpreted. This research promises to show that blacks' higher stroke risk partly reflects actionable differences in the biology of stroke. Such findings may ultimately lead to therapy using existing medications approved for atrial fibrillation. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of novel and treatable cardiac risk factors for stroke will ultimately improve risk factor screening and stroke prevention efforts, thereby reducing the incidence of a disabling and lethal disease. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NINDS's mission that involves reducing the burden of neurological disease by fostering research on the causes and prevention of stroke. The proposed research also addresses NINDS' top priority for future directions of stroke epidemiology research, which is to improve the understanding of race and ethnic stroke disparities.","Left Atrial abNormality, ThromboEmbolism, and Race: Novel risk factors for stroke (LANTERN)",9690198,R01NS097443,"['Anticoagulants ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' blood thinner ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Biology ', ' Blood coagulation ', ' Blood Clotting ', ' Body Surface Area ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Dilatation ', ' Dilatation - action ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' heart sonography ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' embolization ', ' Embolotherapy ', ' Embolization Therapy ', ' Therapeutic Embolization ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Future ', ' Heart ', ' atrium ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Hypertrophy ', ' Incidence ', ' Kentucky ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mission ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Thromboembolism ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Left atrial structure ', ' Left Atrium ', ' heart rhythm ', ' cardiac rhythm ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Modeling ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' biracial ', ' black/white disparity ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' stroke risk ', ' risk of stroke ', ' risk for stroke ', ' stroke outcome ', ' ']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,287673,0.48644934031422177
"StrokeBelt StrokeNet The proposed StrokeBelt StrokeNet (SBSN) RCC will benefit from the established infrastructure, basic science and clinical stroke expertise, and stroke clinical trial experience at UAB, and work with established partner institutions in the Southeastern US, including Children’s of Alabama, the UAB/Lakeshore Research Collaborative, the University of Mississippi Medical Center, and the University of South Alabama. Each institution has its own network of referral hospitals, clinical trial infrastructure and experience enrolling in stroke clinical trials. The result is that a large part of the Stroke Belt will have access to StrokeNet Clinical Trials. The SBSN will succeed by leveraging key attributes of our region and network. First, the SBSN RCC will offer combined access to nearly 3,500 acute stroke patients annually, many of them minorities, in an underserved part of the US. As in our NeuroNext program, we will aggressively pursue the inclusion of underrepresented and minority populations in our clinical trials through collaboration with the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Center (MHRC) and Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment (STRIDE). Second, UAB and its partners have a track record of patient‐ oriented stroke research and successful stroke clinical trial recruitment. Over the last 3 years, UAB alone has participated in 20 NIH‐ or industry‐sponsored multicenter phase 1, 2 and 3 trials in stroke treatment, prevention, and recovery, enrolling 401 patients. We were nationally‐leading recruiters in the TUCSON, CUFFS, CLOTBUST‐HF, SAMMPRIS and CLEAR III trials. We actively enrolled in the first StrokeNet trial, DEFUSE3, are currently enrolling in CREST‐2, and preparing for participation in ARCADIA and CREST‐H. We are the leading recruiting center in MyRIAD and the second leading center for MISTIE III. Over the last 3 years, SBSN institutions/investigators have participated in a total of 37 trials in stroke treatment, prevention, and recovery, and enrolled a total of 2050 subjects. Third, we have extensive experience in stroke recovery with specific expertise in stroke‐related aphasia recovery/rehabilitation, TMS and imaging, motor recovery, tele‐rehabilitation and robotics. Fourth, our proposed network will be strengthened by the already‐strong connections between the UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) and our partner institutions. All of the institutions in our proposed network are already our partners, and already have experience with master IRB reliance agreements. Fifth, our research program will build upon our already‐successful recruitment by applying a performance improvement approach to enhance clinical trial screening, enrollment and retention. Strategies include specific screening, enrollment and retention methods; rigorous and continuous monitoring and performance improvement of trial implementation and subject screening, enrollment and retention; training and sharing of best practices; and programs to enhance engagement and enthusiasm of investigators and coordinators across the network. Sixth, the training of stroke clinical scientists at UAB will be enhanced through programs developed with the UAB CCTS and UAB School of Public Health (SOPH). The proposed StrokeBelt StrokeNet (SBSN) RCC has a robust network of institutions with access to a large population of potential subjects, many of them minorities, in an underserved part of the US, a track record of successful enrollment in stroke clinical trials, a rich community of basic science and translational stroke researchers, and an extraordinarily collaborative environment with the desire to contribute to the StrokeNet effort.",StrokeBelt StrokeNet,9762234,U24NS107223,"['Alabama ', ' Awareness ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Heart ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' Industry ', ' Methods ', ' Mississippi ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurology ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Patients ', ' Quality Control ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Remote Operation (Robotics) ', ' Robotics ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' human subject ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Neurologist ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Recovery ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Medical center ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Modeling ', ' stroke therapy ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke treatment ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Improve Access ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' minority health ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Population ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' telerehabilitation ', ' tele-rehabilitation ', ' telerehab ', ' operation ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' screening ', ' collaborative environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' peer-group atmosphere ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interdisciplinary atmosphere ', ' interactive environment ', ' interactive atmosphere ', ' collaborative atmosphere ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' Business-Friendly Atmosphere ', ' motor recovery ', ' aphasia recovery ', ' recovery in aphasia ', ' minority communities ', ' recruit ', ' Stroke Belt ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke clinical trials ', ' StrokeNet trials ', ' StrokeNet clinical trials ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U24,2019,304027,0.27037371954526007
"Disparities in Transition of Care after Acute Stroke Hospitalization: The Transition of Care Stroke Disparity Study (TCSD-S) Stroke, together with heart disease, accounts for the largest proportion of non-communicable diseases and deaths worldwide. In the US, there are 795,000 annual stroke cases and 150,000 deaths from stroke. Numbers will steeply increase with the aging population. Stroke remains the main cause of serious long-term disability with minorities being affected disproportionally. Greater risk of stroke exists among blacks and Hispanics at younger ages; blacks have greater stroke mortality. Though measures of quality of stroke care during acute hospitalization have improved, little evidence exists on the quality of processes leading to effective stroke prevention and rehabilitation after hospital discharge. Unexpected hospital readmissions 30 days after acute stroke hospitalization are common, as high as 25%, and lead to excess morbidity and cost. Stroke impact on patients', families', and communities' quality of life, and the burden on use and cost of health care is enormous. We propose the Transitions of Care Stroke Disparity Study (TCSD-S) with the main objective to identify race- ethnic and sex disparities in hospital-to-home transition of stroke care and outcomes, social determinants of health associated with these disparities, and to develop effective hospital-initiated system level initiatives to reduce disparities and readmissions, and to improve stroke outcomes. To achieve this objective, we will capitalize on the rich infrastructure and resources of our unique Florida Stroke Registry (FSR), which includes a well-developed network of hospitals, health providers, partnership with the AHA, and other Florida stakeholders. We will evaluate medication adherence, healthy lifestyle, utilization of rehabilitation interventions and medical follow-up 30 days after hospital discharge to home across representative Florida Comprehensive Stroke Centers. A novel Transitions of Stroke Care Performance Index (TOSC PI) will be derived and validated. Thi index will be a primary outcome together with hospital readmissions and stroke outcomes (disability, recurrence, cardiovascular events, and death). Data on TOSC and stroke outcomes will be collected by structured telephone interviews at 30 and 90 days after discharge and review of patient charts. Predictors of TOSC disparities and outcomes will be evaluated using baseline in-hospital data of the index stroke obtained from the FSR, and Social Determinants of Health obtained through a novel data collection instrument from publicly available records. Based on identified predictors of TOSC disparities, we will develop and assess the feasibility of initiatives to reduce TOSC disparities, targeting systems of care with a TOSC disparities dashboard, and health care providers with a training module for enhanced patient education and support at discharge and during follow-up. We will compare the TOSC PI and outcomes before and after the initiatives. The successful completion of this study will identify disparities in hospital-to-home TOSC, define key predictors of poor TOSC and stroke outcomes, and develop initiatives which will be scalable across health systems and which will address disparities, readmission rates, and poor outcomes. Project Narrative Despite improvements in the in-hospital treatment of acute stroke, readmissions, recurrent stroke, and disability remain common and affect minorities disproportionally as transition of care from hospital to home may be suboptimal. This project will define race/ethnic and sex disparities in transitions of care from hospital to home after stroke, identify modifiable factors, and develop initiatives that impact the health care system and educate health care providers to reduce disparities and improve outcomes after stroke. This project is relevant as it targets an understudied aspect of stroke care during transition of care from hospital to home, and may result in reductions of stroke recurrence, disability, readmissions, and disparities in care.  ",Disparities in Transition of Care after Acute Stroke Hospitalization: The Transition of Care Stroke Disparity Study (TCSD-S),9717117,R01MD012467,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Family ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Heart ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"A Community Based Participatory Trial to Increase Stroke Treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-stroke disability represents a significant public health problem. Currently, there are over 7 million stroke survivors in the US, most of whom have persistent disability. Despite the fact that acute stroke treatments dramatically reduce post-stroke disability and are cost saving, they are markedly underutilized. There is no region in the US where acute stroke treatments are more underutilized than in Flint, Michigan. Flint is an urban, underserved city with nearly 100,000 residents of whom about 60% are African American. One of the main reasons for acute stroke treatment underutilization is pre-hospital delay-patients arrive to the hospital too late to receive the treatment. For the past 6 years, the Community Health Partnership-composed of academic partners from the University of Michigan and community partners, Bridges into the Future-has worked to increase acute stroke treatment rates in Flint by decreasing pre-hospital delay. The Community Health Partnership completed several community needs assessments, and from those designed and tested a peer-led, health behavior theory-based intervention in African American churches. The intervention focused on increasing stroke preparedness (i.e., increasing community member's recognition of stroke warning signs and the importance of calling 911 immediately for stroke). This community intervention, Stroke Ready, successfully increased stroke preparedness. The current application represents the larger scale adaption and testing of the Stroke Ready intervention to increase the Flint community's acute stroke treatment rates. Stroke Ready, now expanded to a multi-level intervention, aims to increase acute stroke treatment through both community stroke preparedness and Emergency Department readiness. The Stroke Ready community intervention will adapt and expand the Stroke Ready pilot intervention consisting of interactive workshops and a stroke music video to newly include community-wide education activities such as social media and mass print media. We will also collaborate with a Flint safety-net hospital, where the majority of stroke patients are African American that is in great need of improved acute stroke care, to optimize treatment pathways. The primary outcome of the project will be change in acute stroke treatments, which will directly benefit the entire community by reducing post-stroke disability. Sustainability will be achieved in Flint by training of peer-leaders, wide dissemination of Stroke Ready materials, ease of administering the intervention, hospital improvements and continued commitment and engagement of the Community Advisory Board. The products of this application include a strategy to improve acute stroke treatments in safety-net hospitals and the easy to deliver Stroke Ready community intervention to allow for sustainability and dissemination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If acute stroke treatments are given soon after the start of a stroke, they can reduce the chance that stroke survivors are left with disability. Yet few stroke patients, particularly African Americans, receive these treatments. In this project, community and academic researchers will work together to increase the number of patients who receive acute stroke treatments in the predominately African American community of Flint, Michigan.",A Community Based Participatory Trial to Increase Stroke Treatment,9852922,U01MD010579,"['Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Michigan ', ' Music ', ' Patients ', ' Printed Media ', ' Public Health ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Cost Savings ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Acute ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Relative Risks ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Church ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' theories ', ' stroke therapy ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke treatment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' post stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' after stroke ', ' community intervention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' safety net ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' successful intervention ', ' 911 call ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' social media ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke symptom ', ' urban underserved ', ' recruit ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke incidence ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,59154,0.45767615548086965
"Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project Abstract While stroke incidence and mortality are declining in the United States (US), Mexican Americans still have a much higher stroke burden with higher incidence and recurrence, worse neurologic, functional and cognitive outcome, and newly projected higher mortality following stroke. Mexican Americans are the most numerous sub-group of Hispanic Americans, the largest minority population in the US. This important group is aging, growing rapidly, and spreading throughout the country. This renewal application of the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project will facilitate a quarter century population-based examination of stroke trends in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites, including, for the first time, consideration of trends in neurologic, functional, cognitive and quality of life outcomes. This data is crucial for public health planning and monitoring the effectiveness of interventions. The overwhelming majority of stroke patients have long-term sequelae from their stroke that impact their well-being. For the first time, BASIC will investigate outcomes that are important to patients and their caregivers using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), a well validated tool developed under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health and recommended by a stroke expert panel. This new data collection will yield critical data as the first step in developing interventions to improve stroke outcome and reduce stroke’s impact in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Additionally, we will link more than a decade’s worth of data from BASIC with multiple large administrative datasets, including the Texas State Inpatient Research Data File and Emergency Department Dataset and Medicare data, to study ethnic-specific missed opportunities for primary and secondary prevention, such as emergency department visits where atrial fibrillation is noted but not acted upon prior to stroke. We will also examine post-stroke resource utilization to identify areas to improve stroke outcomes and reduce ethnic disparities. In sum, BASIC will continue to provide the only ongoing, uninterrupted stroke surveillance in Mexican Americans; we will focus on ethnic differences and similarities in patient reported outcomes aimed towards designing interventions to improve outcomes; and we will create a stroke “big data” resource combining the strengths of BASIC’s validated stroke events with detailed clinical data and healthcare utilization information from administrative data to prevent stroke and improve outcome. BASIC has amassed a cohort of over 11,000 stroke patients since January 1, 2000, and we add an additional 450 each year. In addition to the rich publication record and numerous spin-off projects, BASIC has just begun to fully take advantage of this precious stroke patient resource. Project Narrative The Mexican American population in the United States is rapidly growing and aging. This project extends the highly successful Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC), the only population-based stroke study in Mexican Americans, to study quarter-century stroke trends, newly investigate ethnic-specific patient-reported outcomes, and link BASIC with administrative data to seek out strategies for primary and secondary stroke prevention and improved recovery.

"The University of Iowa's Regional Stroke Research Network The University of Iowa (UI) Regional Stroke Research Network meets the goal of NIH StrokeNet in maximizing efficiencies to develop, promote, and conduct high quality multi-site clinical trials testing promising interventions in stroke prevention, treatment, and recovery. The current proposal builds on the rich tradition of the UI as a leader in both developing and conducting NINDS-sponsored research, The long-term goal of this proposal is to improve the outcomes of the 800,000 Americans who suffer a stroke every year, particularly those subjected to disparities in health outcomes due to geographically underserved areas. Our proposal's immediate goals are to improve the collective network recruitment efficiency and generalizability of NINDS- sponsored trials by facilitating enrollment of subjects with geographical barriers to participation. Specifically, we aim to increase the number of efficient stroke interventions that can be applied to the vast majority of patients in the US. With that goal in mind, we propose to maintain the UIRCC as an Upper Midwest regional research network efficient in recruiting subjects in NINDS- funded stroke trials. The UIRCC is an already operational infrastructure of 14 trial-ready hospitals in Iowa, Nebraska, and North Dakota that enables enrollment of Americans that have been traditionally challenging to include in trials due to their geographically location. At the same time, the UIRCC will continue to engage a multidisciplinary team of translational researchers to generate innovative research proposals that will lead to multicenter clinical trials through StrokeNet. .

"Outcomes Among Surrogate decision makers In Stroke (OASIS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every day in hospitals across the country, patients with severe stroke and their families are faced with decisions about life-sustaining treatments in the initial hours of admission. These decisions about resuscitation status, invasive treatments, or possible transitions to comfort care are typically made by a surrogate decision- maker due to communication or cognitive deficits in the patient. This surrogate must consider the patient's life goals and values to determine if their loved one would choose on-going intensive treatments where they may survive and yet have long term disabilities, or prioritize comfort and accept the likelihood of an earlier death. Serving as a surrogate decision maker for a patient in the intensive care unit can have long lasting negative consequences. However, almost nothing is known about surrogate decision makers in diverse populations with stroke. Hispanic Americans are now the largest minority group in the US, rapidly growing and aging, with Mexican Americans comprising the largest subgroup. Multiple disparities have been identified in stroke incidence and outcome between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites, particularly in the use of life- sustaining treatments. Minority populations may be particularly vulnerable to inadequate communication about end-of-life issues due to socioeconomic disadvantage, poor health literacy, and lack of provider empathy and health system strategies to improve communication. However, Mexican American culture includes strong values of family support and religiosity that may have a positive influence on discussions about life-sustaining treatment and adapting to stroke-related disabilities. There is currently a critical gap in understanding the perspectives and outcomes of stroke surrogate decision makers, making it impossible to design interventions to help diverse populations of patients and families through this incredibly trying time. The aims of this proposal are 1) To assess physician quality of communication, shared decision-making, and quality of end-of-life care among stroke surrogate decision makers; and 2) To assess the long-term impact of serving as a surrogate decision maker for stroke and assess the unmet decision support needs of stroke surrogates. Results will be used to design future targeted decision support interventions for diverse populations of stroke patients and family members. This proposal takes advantage of the extensive established infrastructure of the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS038916), a population based epidemiological stroke surveillance study recently funded for its fourth 5-year cycle. New prospectively obtained data on surrogate decision-maker outcomes using established validated measures will be linked to BASIC's rich longitudinal patient-level data on functional outcome to maximize efficiency. Leveraging the resources of this highly successful project will allow a comprehensive yet cost-effective investigation that would not otherwise be feasible to study in a prospective longitudinal cohort design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently, very little is known about the experience and outcomes of family members who make medical decisions for individuals with stroke. Results from this project will improve our understanding of the early and long-range consequences of these challenging decisions in diverse populations and help to develop specific interventions to reduce the emotional and psychological burden on family members.",Outcomes Among Surrogate decision makers In Stroke (OASIS),9764508,R01NS091112,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Aging ', ' Anxiety ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Empathy ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Interview ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Minority Groups ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physicians ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Regrets ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Family member ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Country ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Emotional ', ' end of life care ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Health system ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' health literacy ', ' attributable mortality ', ' attributable death ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' loved ones ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' surveillance study ', ' quality of death ', ' quality of dying ', ' shared decision making ', ' surrogate decision maker ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' family support ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke incidence ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke outcome ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,589618,0.26608912840488264
"PeRiodontal treatment to Eliminate Minority InEquality and Rural disparities in Stroke (PREMIERS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death and the leading cause of long-term adult disability in the United States. Stroke remains more common in North and South Carolina, part of the ""buckle"" of the stroke belt, and disproportionately impacts African Americans. The reasons for this racial disparity are poorly understood and are not entirely explained by traditional stroke risk factors. The REGARDS study found that tooth loss (a surrogate of periodontal disease) was more common among African Americans than whites and was associated with higher stroke risk and stroke risk factors. Given this result, REGARDS investigators postulated that periodontal disease may be contributing to the racial disparity in stroke. Additional data from this study shows that low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with greater tooth loss, both of which are seen more frequently in African Americans as opposed to their white counterparts. Considering these factors, a question arises about whether low SES, race, a combination of the two, and/or traditional risk factors contribute to tooth loss, periodontl disease, and recurrent vascular events. Howard and colleagues suggest in their paper that race is the predominant factor contributing to vascular events after adjustment for SES and risk factors. If the predisposition exists among African Americans for greater periodontal disease and incident vascular events, then what modifications can clinicians make to prevent recurrent vascular events in this population? The PREMIERS study is a application for conducting an adequately powered two-center Phase III randomized controlled trial to test whether intensive periodontal treatment reduces the risk of recurrent vascular events among ischemic stroke and TIA survivors. The study uses the resources in both states including established dental centers, Joint Commission Certified Stroke Centers, the Schools of Public Health, and the Institute for Partnerships to Eliminate Health Disparities. The application addresses specific issues with regards to recruitment of African-American and rural stroke/TIA patients advocating the use of culturally appropriate strategies to educate the study subjects regarding stroke, periodontal disease and the periodontal stroke link. The study proposes to utilize economic evaluation of the periodontal intervention from the budgetary perspective. The focus will be on the financial sustainability of providing aggressive periodontal therapy (with certain, although relatively low expenditures) in exchange for a reduction of uncertain recurrent vascular events that may require high cost emergency department utilization and/or inpatient care. The sustainability of the proposed intervention after the completion of the project is integrally linked to the health economic assessment to show the health care cost savings. By integration with a rural primary care center, with an African American majority and households with average incomes below the state average, the study ensures that the proposed intervention to reduce stroke disparity is applicable to this target population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and periodontal disease are prevalent among African Americans residing in North Carolina and South Carolina, states recognized as the ""buckle"" of the stroke belt. Advanced periodontal disease is associated with an increased risk of recurrent vascular events in stroke/TIA patients. We propose a two-center Phase III randomized, controlled trial that will improve the understanding of biological mechanisms of stroke disparities, including race and socioeconomic status, through improved periodontal care.",PeRiodontal treatment to Eliminate Minority InEquality and Rural disparities in Stroke (PREMIERS),9619547,R01MD009738,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+

"Family Study of Atherosclerosis and Vascular Cognitive Dysfunction Project Summary Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability in the US and disproportionally affects minority populations. Hispanics have a particularly high risk for stroke; this increased risk of stroke may be explained by specific genetic and non-genetic factors. Dominicans are the fastest growing Caribbean Hispanics in the US, and yet little is known about their genetic and non-genetic determinants of stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD). For the past 15 years, our team has been investigating stroke genetic risk factors in Dominicans. We have assembled a cohort of Dominican families at high risk of stroke and focused on stroke precursor phenotypes (SPPs) to reduce phenotypic heterogeneity and complexity of stroke etiology. We investigated well-recognized SPPs including carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, left ventricular mass, and left atrial diameter. We have successfully identified quantitative trait loci and DNA sequence variants associated with SPPs using high throughput genotyping and next generation sequencing. These findings account for a small portion of the inter- individual variation in SPPs. In this application, we propose to expand our investigations to conduct a methylome- wide-association-study (MWAS) to identify differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) associated with SPPs, stroke and CVD. Methylation is an epigenetic process that regulates gene expression without changing DNA sequence. DNA methylation has been shown as a key process contributing to the development of vascular disease. The proposed investigations would provide new insights relevant to the development of novel clinical strategies for prevention and treatment of stroke and CVD, as our ultimate goal is to reduce stroke risk and race- ethnic disparities in stroke and CVD. We plan 4 aims: Aim 1 to identify DMRs associated with stroke SPPs; Aim 2 to assess the relative contribution of genetic and non-genetic factors to SPP-associated DMRs; Aim3 to evaluate the functional impact of DNA sequence variation and DMRs using CRISPR-Cas9 technology; and Aim 4 to examine the predictive effect of SPP-associated DMRs on vascular events. To achieve these aims we will leverage the rich data already collected in the Family Study and add new data collection to detect vascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular death). We will validate the findings in an independent sample from the ongoing longitudinal Northern Manhattan Study, from which the Family Study originated. Both studies have used the same assessment tools and collection instruments for obtaining SPPs, lifestyle risk factors and genome-wide SNP data. The innovative aspects of our proposal include novel discoveries of modifiable epigenetic sites for stroke and CVD, CRISPR-Cas9 technology to model specific genome-editing, a unique population of Dominicans and a family study design, and an available independent population of Dominicans for validation studies. Findings from our study may lead to the most promising molecular strategies for risk stratification, prevention and treatment of stroke. Project Narrative Stroke is a major public health problem that disproportionally affects Hispanics. For over 15 years, we have been investigating genetic risk factors for stroke in Dominicans, one of the fastest growing sub-populations of Hispanics in the US.

"DISPLACE: Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment Project Abstract Ischemic stroke is a potentially preventable, devastating complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), a group of inherited blood disorders that affect close to 100,000 individuals in the United States. Without intervention, stroke may occur in up to 24% of individuals with the highest risk form of SCD, sickle cell anemia. Despite improvements in comprehensive care and management of SCD in children, stroke remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to insufficient screening and prevention practices. Individuals living with SCD continue to face multiple health disparities cause by racial and socioeconomic factors as well as disease- specific disparities in funding and private sector support. In order to standardize and improve care, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) released evidence-based guidelines in 2014. These guidelines established routine transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) screening as a means for identifying children at high risk of stroke and indefinite chronic red cell transfusions (CRCT) as a means of treating children at high risk for stroke based on the previous NHLBI funded, randomized controlled STOP (Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Disease) results. This proposal, entitled DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) is a multi-site effort focused on enhancing the implementation and dissemination of these evidence-based stroke prevention guidelines in SCD. The research approach is guided by the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation and the multilevel ecological model of health. The DISPLACE leadership core at the Medical University of South Carolina is a multidisciplinary team lead by Dr. Julie Kanter, Dr. Robert Adams and Dr. Cathy Melvin and includes specialists in multicenter clinical trial design, hematology, implementation science, qualitative analysis and statistical evaluation. The Data Coordinating Unit (DCU) at MUSC who have coordinated over 40 multicenter studies and will provide study design and information technology support and data management support the leadership core. The aims of DISPLACE are to: 1) assess the gap between current and guideline- recommended practices for stroke prevention among pediatric patients with SCD, 2) assess the multi-level patient, provider, and systems barriers and enablers to performing TCD screening and initiating CRCT, and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of a novel multi-level dissemination and implementation strategy to increase current annual TCD screening rates and CRCT initiation rates using a parallel cluster-randomized clinical trial. We have assembled a large, multi-institutional collaboration of institutions with widespread geographic distribution to best assess the feasibility and utility of the multi-level implementation strategy. The long-term goal of DISPLACE is to ensure that all children with SCD receive guideline-based care for stroke prevention for a “stroke free generation” in SCD. Project Narrative Stroke is a potentially preventable, devastating complication in individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD), a blood disorder which a primarily affects a minority population in the United States. This proposal, entitled DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) is the first multi-site effort focused on enhancing the implementation and dissemination of evidence-based stroke prevention guidelines in sickle cell disease. The guidelines are an evidence-based summary of recommendations released in 2014 by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) in order to enhance care in this at-risk patient population.",DISPLACE: Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment,9925881,R01HL133896,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Complication ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' Dictionary ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Vascular Endothelium ', ' Environment ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' Hematology ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' hydroxy-urea ', ' Hydroxycarbamide ', ' Hydroxycarbamid ', ' hydroxyurea ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Private Sector ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' South Carolina ', ' Standardization ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' Third-Party Payer ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Doppler Ultrasound ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Transfusion ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Knowledge ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' Prevention ', ' Brain Infarction ', ' brain infarct ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical study ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' Prevention Protocols ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention Guidelines ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' treatment strategy ', ' screening ', ' Prevention trial ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' social media ', ' patient screening ', ' implementation strategy ', ' stroke risk ', ' risk of stroke ', ' risk for stroke ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2019,1015445,0.34117937186211206
"A Remotely-Operated Robotic Endovascular Platform to Improve Thrombectomy Access Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) results from a blood clot in the neurovasculature. Currently, AIS remains the 5th leading cause of death in the United States (US) and is the leading cause of neurological disability. AIS will impact more than 700,000 Americans in 2018 and, despite the recent advances in stroke care, there still exists a 65% chance of death or severe disability. By 2030, it is expected that the US’s AIS economic burden will exceed $180B. Standard of care AIS therapies include the use of thrombolysis within 4.5 hours of stroke onset and thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions as early as possible. However, despite thrombectomy’s proven value, poor geographic access to early thrombectomy still results in a large disparity in care.  In the US, thrombectomies are largely performed at Comprehensive Stroke Centers (CSCs), for which there are less than 170. CSC certification is associated with extensive requirements, including access to high- level expertise, 24/7 access to care, dedicated neuro intensive care beds, on-site thrombectomy, CT/MR/CTA/MRA imaging, and participation in clinical research. Because considerable costs are associated with setting up and maintaining a CSC, these centers are concentrated near highly-populated urban centers, which can provide larger patient volumes. However, the consequence is that more than half of Americans face transfer times longer than 1hr, and for many, transfer delays can exceed 2hrs.  To help address this considerable gap in providing equal thrombectomy access to all Americans, the Joint Commission (in collaboration with the AHA/ASA) announced the Thrombectomy-Capable Stroke Center (TSC) certification program on January 1, 2018, with the goal of creating a geographically-dispersed thrombectomy- capable hospital network. However, building this TSC network will be a challenge given that 1) the associated costs in staffing a 24/7 TSC program will be high, 2) there are less than 3500 US neuroradiologists to draw from, and 3) the highest-level of expertise will likely remain concentrated within in high-volume CSCs.  UN&UP has invented a novel and remotely-enabled robotic technology that bolsters the Joint Commission’s TSC initiative. The technology’s innovation relates to the use of an angiosuite-compatible magnet-based workstation to navigate neurovascular tools composed of a unique magnetic alloy, which can be shaped into small, remotely-navigable guidewires and microcatheters. The result is a magnet-based robotic platform than is 40X smaller than previously possible and, for the first time, offers robotic solutions to the neurointerventionalist. UN&UP’s team consists of leading magnetics, robotics, telemedical, and stroke experts. The project’s aims include 1) building the prototype magnet workstation, 2) building novel magnetic guidewires and microcatheters, and 3) assessing device performance in vascular phantoms based upon CTA/MRA neurovascular datasets. Given strong FDA 510k predicates, the technology is expected to be regulated per the 510k framework. An FDA pre-submission meeting will be conducted in advance of a Phase II proposal. There are more than 700,000 annual acute ischemic strokes in the US, with thrombectomy recommended for proximal artery occlusions in the anterior circulation; however, the benefits of thrombectomy for stroke victims have been hampered by long transfer times to comprehensive stroke centers. To improve thrombectomy access, the Joint Commission partnered with the American Heart Association and the American Stoke Association to launch the “Thrombectomy-Capable Stroke Center” program in early 2018; however, the substantial cost associated with staffing a low-volume, geographically-dispersed thrombectomy service that provides 24/7 access to highly-skilled neurointerventionalists will be an obstacle for this much-needed program. To address this gap in care, UN&UP (short for “Unmet Needs and Underserved Populations”) will demonstrate proof of concept of its cost-effective robotic interventional neuroradiology platform in this Phase I SBIR application which helps provides early thrombectomy access to all Americans by enabling stroke experts to guide thrombectomy procedures regardless of their geographic availability.",A Remotely-Operated Robotic Endovascular Platform to Improve Thrombectomy Access,9776968,R43NS112035,"['Alloys ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Angiography ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Angiogram ', ' Beds ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' biological material ', ' Biomaterials ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood coagulation ', ' Blood Clotting ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Certification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Cobalt ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Geography ', ' Glues ', ' Goals ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Joints ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' Manuals ', ' Microscopy ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Pt element ', ' Platinum Black ', ' Platinum ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Remote Operation (Robotics) ', ' Robotics ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Technology ', ' Tensile Strength ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Welding ', ' Work ', ' Xrays ', ' X-Rays Radiation ', ' X-Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' Measures ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Thrombectomy ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Anterior ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' retinal rods ', ' rod cell ', ' Rod Photoreceptors ', ' Rod ', ' disability ', ' Measurement ', ' artery occlusion ', ' Artery Obstruction ', ' Arterial Occlusion ', ' Arterial Obstruction ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' thrombolysis ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic ', ' magnetic field ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' stroke therapy ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke treatment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Improve Access ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Docking ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' wound ', ' cost effective ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' prototype ', ' FDA approved ', ' standard of care ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' arm ', ' 3D Print ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3-D print ', ' clinical predictors ', ' certificate program ', ' neurovascular ', ' neuro-vascular ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' stroke victims ', ' stroke event ', ' robotic system ', ' safety assessment ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNANDUP, LLC",R43,2019,326982,0.3309284815981189
"DISCOVERY: Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY Stroke is the major cause of an adult disability epidemic in the US, with a major contribution from post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID), the rates of which are disproportionally high among the health disparity populations. Despite the PSCID’s overwhelming impact on public health, a knowledge gap exists with regard to the complex interaction between the acute stroke event and highly prevalent pre-existing brain pathology related to cerebrovascular (VCID) and Alzheimer’s disease, or related dementia (AD/ADRD). Understanding the factors that modulate PSCID risk in relation to index stroke event is critically important for developing personalized prognostication of PSCID, targeted interventions to prevent PSCID, and informing future clinical trial design. In response to this critical challenge, we propose Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY (DISCOVERY), a collaborative network of clinical sites with access to acute stroke populations and the expertise and capacity for systematic assessment of PSCID led by a team of recognized experts in VCID, AD, acute stroke, health disparities, and multi-center research. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine which specific subsets of stroke events cause (or do not cause) PSCID and which additional demographic (sex, race, ethnicity), clinical factors and comorbidities that synergize with acute stroke to result in or prevent PSCID. The overall scientific objective of this study is to elucidate mechanisms of brain resilience/susceptibility to PSCID in diverse US populations based on complex interplay between life-course exposure to multiple vascular risk factors, pre-existing burden of microvascular and neurodegenerative pathology, the effect of strategic acute stroke lesions, and the mediating effect of genomic/epigenomic variation. We will achieve this goal by implementing the DISCOVERY Network of 30 clinical sites, which under the leadership of the Administrative Core and guided by the research strategy delineated by the Recruitment and Retention, Statistics, and Repository Cores, will conduct a prospective, multi- center, observational, nested-cohort study of 8,000 nondemented ischemic and hemorrhagic incident stroke patients within 72 hours of symptom onset, who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, with serial cognitive evaluations and assessments of functional outcome, with subsets undergoing research MRI and PET and comprehensive genetic/genomic and fluid biomarker testing. In a series of systematic, hypothesis driven experiments we will: 1) identify the independent and combined effect of the acute stroke lesion, pre-existing burden of disease, and baseline markers of brain resilience on PSCID; 2) examine the role of acute stroke as a critical factor in accelerating AD/ADRD and VCID pathology leading to PSCID; and 3) develop two distinct generalizable personalized-medicine models for individual patient outcome prediction and patient selection for clinical trials. DISCOVERY will become a landmark study to unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early stroke recovery, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation. Stroke-related disability - including cognitive impairment and dementia - is a public health epidemic and a key national research priority in the United States. Because of its disproportionately high impact on health disparity populations, understanding the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive decline is a matter of equitable health care delivery. DISCOVERY, the proposed collaborative nationwide network of clinical sites with access to diverse acute stroke US populations has the expertise, experience and capacity to execute a large prospective study that will unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early recovery after stroke, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and

"A Community Based Participatory Trial to Increase Stroke Treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-stroke disability represents a significant public health problem. Currently, there are over 7 million stroke survivors in the US, most of whom have persistent disability. Despite the fact that acute stroke treatments dramatically reduce post-stroke disability and are cost saving, they are markedly underutilized. There is no region in the US where acute stroke treatments are more underutilized than in Flint, Michigan. Flint is an urban, underserved city with nearly 100,000 residents of whom about 60% are African American. One of the main reasons for acute stroke treatment underutilization is pre-hospital delay-patients arrive to the hospital too late to receive the treatment. For the past 6 years, the Community Health Partnership-composed of academic partners from the University of Michigan and community partners, Bridges into the Future-has worked to increase acute stroke treatment rates in Flint by decreasing pre-hospital delay. The Community Health Partnership completed several community needs assessments, and from those designed and tested a peer-led, health behavior theory-based intervention in African American churches. The intervention focused on increasing stroke preparedness (i.e., increasing community member's recognition of stroke warning signs and the importance of calling 911 immediately for stroke). This community intervention, Stroke Ready, successfully increased stroke preparedness. The current application represents the larger scale adaption and testing of the Stroke Ready intervention to increase the Flint community's acute stroke treatment rates. Stroke Ready, now expanded to a multi-level intervention, aims to increase acute stroke treatment through both community stroke preparedness and Emergency Department readiness. The Stroke Ready community intervention will adapt and expand the Stroke Ready pilot intervention consisting of interactive workshops and a stroke music video to newly include community-wide education activities such as social media and mass print media. We will also collaborate with a Flint safety-net hospital, where the majority of stroke patients are African American that is in great need of improved acute stroke care, to optimize treatment pathways. The primary outcome of the project will be change in acute stroke treatments, which will directly benefit the entire community by reducing post-stroke disability. Sustainability will be achieved in Flint by training of peer-leaders, wide dissemination of Stroke Ready materials, ease of administering the intervention, hospital improvements and continued commitment and engagement of the Community Advisory Board.

"Improving Post-Acute Care to Reduce Ethnic Stroke Disparities Abstract Mexican Americans are the most numerous sub-group of Hispanic Americans, the largest minority population in the United States. This important group is aging, growing rapidly and spreading throughout the country. For the past 19 years the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project has provided rich original stroke disparities research comparing Mexican Americans and non Hispanic whites. BASIC has demonstrated that stroke incidence is higher in Mexican Americans compared with non Hispanic whites and that the relative Mexican American:Non-Hispanic white stroke disparity remains completely unabated over the last decade. Further, Mexican American stroke survivors have worse neurologic, functional, cognitive and quality of life outcomes compared with non Hispanic whites for reasons that are not yet understood. Worse stroke outcomes in Mexican Americans are not explained by socio-demographics, including education and insurance, stroke treatment, stroke severity or subtype, or pre-stroke factors. One potential explanation for the ethnic differences in stroke outcome is differences in post-acute care (PAC) in the form of rehabilitation or insufficiently resourced informal care. Virtually no data exists on stroke rehabilitation or informal stroke caregiving in Mexican Americans to inform this hypothesis. The current proposal will leverage the infrastructure of the longstanding, population-based BASIC Project to explore PAC in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites from multiple perspectives: patients, caregivers, and community. First, the study will collect detailed data on PAC in the 90 days following stroke and explore the predictors of PAC, including socio-economic and cultural factors, and how these may differ by ethnicity. We will capitalize on the rich stroke outcome data collected in BASIC to explore for the first time ethnic differences in PAC and their influence on ethnic disparities in stroke outcomes. Second, the study will enroll stroke caregivers and collect comprehensive data on the caregiving experiences and outcomes of individuals providing informal care to stroke survivors. Finally, the study will employ an innovative strategy to determine gaps between the needs of informal caregivers and available community resources for caregiving. This line of research will inform culturally sensitive intervention strategies across multiple levels to improve stroke outcomes in Mexican Americans, a growing, aging and large minority population that will increasingly feel the impact from stroke in the next decade. BASIC is the only study capable of addressing these important questions about stroke in Mexican Americans. Project Narrative This project will leverage the infrastructure of the longstanding Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project to investigate multiple aspects of post-acute care following stroke in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites including rehabilitation, informal caregiving, and gaps between caregiving needs and available community resources.

"Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to continue our population-based study of stroke incidence and case fatality, prevalence of risk factors, stroke treatment, and post-stroke outcomes within a biracial metropolitan population of 1,368,604 of whom 223,417 (16.3%) are of black race (US Census 2010). The proposed work will involve an anticipated ~3,750 patients with 4,250 strokes and/or transient ischemic attacks from our region in 2014/2015, an estimated ~600 recurrent strokes from 2015-2018 (following all strokes and transient ischemic attacks for 3 years after the original 2014/2015 event), as well as 2,000 survey participants.  For almost 20 years, we have studied trends in stroke incidence and case fatality and have demonstrated a racial disparity where stroke incidence in African-Americans is more than double that of whites. In each prior study period, we have also examined the prevalence of risk factors (and knowledge of stroke) via a population survey in order to put our temporal trend findings into context.  In addition to continuing these important activities, we seek to examine stroke recurrence in a population- based fashion (which has not been done since the 1990's) with the goal of identifying whether there is a racial disparity in stroke recurrence. We propose an innovative pilot study to determine if we can estimate functional outcome and place of residence at 3- and 6-months post-stroke without patient contact, using a local health- information exchange (HIE) and electronic health record. We will compare our estimate to phone interviews with the subject as the ""gold standard""; the phone interview to be used was successfully piloted in the current period. Finally, we have used our data to inform eligibility for stroke clinical trils. We propose to share our data with the scientific community for this purpose. In our proposed work, we will have data regarding acute stroke presentation and will add information about stroke recurrence and post-stroke functional outcomes that can be used for rational planning of stroke interventions in all phases of stroke (acute, secondary prevention, recovery).  In all of th proposed activities, the use of the HIE will make the proposed work possible (harnessing the power of centralized health data) and will be important for accomplishing the work efficiently. Overall, our proposed study will accomplish more than prior periods in a shorter time and without increased cost. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The change in stroke occurrence and recurrence over time is the ultimate test of how well science has translated new discoveries into benefits for the population. Our study has examined racial disparities in stroke over the last 20 years, showing that blacks have higher risk for stroke than whites.

"Stroke Central Atlantic Network for Research (SCANR) SCANR, the Stroke Central Atlantic Network for Research is based in the Mid-Atlantic region and headquartered in Washington, DC, and Charlottesville, VA. SCANR is located on the edge of the Stroke Belt, and both DC and Baltimore have high stroke incidence. SCANR includes four Carnegie Research 1 universities (Georgetown and George Washington Universities; the Universities of Virginia and Maryland), two CTSAs, a translational research institute (THRIV), a US News & World Report National Honor Roll Hospital (Children's National Medical Center), the largest hospital in DC (MedStar Washington Hospital Center), two Historically Black Universities (Howard University and University of DC) and the NINDS Intramural Stroke Program. SCANR sites evaluated over 4100 acute strokes in 2016, >50% were Black/African American. Our NINDS-funded trial recruitment is excellent, screening all eligible patients for and enrolling in StrokeNet trials: DEFUSE 3, MISTIE 3, HiDef, Rhapsody, SHINE, POINT, and MR WITNESS, along with additional NINDS-funded trials. SCANR also includes the National Coordinating Center for SHINE (UVa, Johnston-PI), and the CREST-2 registry and imaging core (UMB, Lal). SCANR 2.0 continues to have all of the excellent qualities that made SCANR 1.0 a strong contender for StrokeNet selection: pediatric stroke and stroke rehabilitation, patient populations and innovative recruitment practices for health disparities research, and the link to the NINDS Intramural Stroke Program. These strengths will stand out with the pediatric, rehab, and pediatric rehab trials in the StrokeNet pipeline. SCANR 2.0 includes UVa as a high-performing site for acute treatment and prevention trials. UVa also provides expertise in biomarkers, genetics, and prehospital research. The addition of UVa and UMB made SCANR a truly regional Coordinating Center. SCANR 2.0 research expertise includes multimodal imaging, microbiomics, multi-omics, Neurorehabilitation trials, brain stimulation, and robotics. We are well positioned to translate early phase NINDS intramural studies into the extramural setting. We have a track record of recruiting substantial numbers of specific cerebrovascular phenotypes (cervical artery dissection, cerebral venous thrombosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, etc.). Our consortium of academic rehab hospitals is outstanding. We currently have four trial proposals submitted to StrokeNet in varying stages of the process. Our existing Participant Recruitment and Retention Core (PRRO Core) has played a leadership role in the StrokeNet network. SCANR investigators serve on national StrokeNet steering committees and cores. Our StrokeNet fellows have diverse clinical backgrounds (2 vascular neurologists, 1 PT PhD, 1 OT) and subsequently, they successfully compete for external funding (TL-2, KL-2, AHA). They have opportunities for outstanding research training and mentorship across our Mid-Atlantic institutions, preparing them for productive research careers. SCANR investigators recently successfully established a novel national K12 program for rehabilitation research. We currently have 5 relevant fellowship programs and three adult neurology residencies at the SCANR 2.0 sites. This training joins strong multidisciplinary clinical and research expertise in stroke with much experience in research and career development of clinician scientists. The Stroke Central Atlantic Network for Research encompasses the Mid-Atlantic region. As a Regional Coordinating Center (RCC), it will continue recruiting people with stroke for trials ranging from prevention to acute intervention to rehabilitation. The unusual features of this RCC are its capture of nearly all stroke patients in DC and much of the Mid-Atlantic, its ability to recruit underserved individuals from both urban and rural settings, and its research strengths in multimodal MRI, genetics, Neurorehabilitation, and disparities.",Stroke Central Atlantic Network for Research (SCANR),9755524,U24NS107222,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Arteries ', ' Baltimore ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Dissection ', ' Hospitals ', ' Leadership ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maryland ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Middle Atlantic States ', ' Mid-Atlantic Region ', ' Neurology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Registries ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Research Institute ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Residencies ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Remote Operation (Robotics) ', ' Robotics ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Phlebothrombosis ', ' Venous Thrombosis ', ' Virginia ', ' Washington ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' career ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' stroke rehab ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' Cervical ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Funding ', ' news ', ' Genetic ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' Rehabilitation Research ', ' Research Training ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Fellowship Program ', ' Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Program ', ' K12 Program ', ' K12 Mechanism ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' treatment trial ', ' Childhood stroke ', ' pediatric stroke ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' patient population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' screening ', ' Prevention trial ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' urban setting ', ' rural setting ', ' rural place ', ' rural locality ', ' recruit ', ' participant retention ', ' microbiome research ', ' microbiome studies ', ' microbiome science ', ' Microbiomics ', ' Stroke Belt ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke incidence ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' StrokeNet trials ', ' stroke trials ', ' ']",NINDS,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U24,2019,405461,0.358538212414458
"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9609472,R01HL126700,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Apnea ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Elements ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sleep-related breathing disorder ', ' Sleep-Disordered Breathing ', ' Sleep Hypopnea ', ' Sleep Apnea ', ' Sleep Apnea Syndromes ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Time ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' Pulse Rates ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Devices ', ' Autonomic Dysfunction ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' post stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' after stroke ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' surveillance study ', ' screening ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' stroke survivor ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' Risk stratification ', ' patient screening ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke risk ', ' risk of stroke ', ' risk for stroke ', ' stroke outcome ', ' stroke trials ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,739858,0.4811929638256092
"Assessing Population-based Radiological brain health in Stroke Epidemiology (APRISE) Study DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT: Stroke recurrence is a major public health problem. It has been understudied epidemiologically despite comprising ~25% of all stroke in the US, and leading to higher morbidity and mortality compared to initial events. Furthermore, compared to our understanding of the role of traditional risk factors for first stroke, we have limited understanding of the risk factors for recurrent stroke. Radiological measures of small vessel and large-vessel disease may provide a measure of a subject’s current “Brain Health” to predict future cerebrovascular events and vascular dementia. Understanding small vessel disease in particular—manifesting as white matter hyperintensity, microbleeds, lacunar infarcts, dilated perivascular spaces, and brain atrophy–is a top NINDS priority. Although the Framingham risk score is widely used for clinical decision-making, and the ABCD scores predict 90-day stroke risk among minor stroke/TIA patients, no clinical prediction tool in a broader ischemic or a hemorrhagic stroke population-based cohort has been established. A Framingham-like “Risk Function Tool for Secondary Stroke,” especially one incorporating the full gamut of modern imaging parameters developed in a racially diverse population, would likely identify high-risk patients for targeted education interventions, novel antithrombotics, and aggressive clinical care. Moreover, it may reveal novel causal pathways and risk factors for future investigation. We propose an ancillary study to the ongoing Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study (GCKNSS) entitled APRISE (Assessing Population-based Radiological brain health in Stroke Epidemiology). Our objective is to build on the GCNKSS infrastructure to radiologically characterize the full stroke/TIA population of Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky from 2015 and create the first modern, largely MRI-based characterization of brain health in a contemporary stroke/TIA population. Our specific aim is to create a prediction model of cerebrovascular disease recurrence (ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke) incorporating imaging parameters in a biracial, large-scale ischemic stroke/TIA population using state-of-the-art modeling approaches. We will achieve these goals by radiologically characterizing the stroke/TIA population (~2700 ischemic and ~525 hemorrhagic stroke, and ~1025 TIA patients) in the NIH-funded GCNKSS of a 1.4 million, biracial population. We will leverage the extensive GCNKSS infrastructure, which is already in place to detect recurrent stroke, placing us in a unique position to develop a recurrent stroke risk model using newly acquired radiologic data with remarkable efficiency. The proposed study will allow the first and only population-based characterization of the entire imaging spectrum of brain health in stroke/TIA patients.

"Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly Stroke is a major public health problem in the United States. It is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of serious disability in adults. There are an estimated 800,000 strokes in the United States each year, with an estimated 7 million stroke survivors. Twenty percent of stroke survivors require institutional care after 3 months and 15%-30% are permanently disabled. Recurrent events, which occur in 185,000 stroke survivors in the United States each year, are associated with higher mortality rates, greater levels of disability, and increased costs as compared with first strokes. Stroke in adults is strongly age dependent, and the rate of adverse outcomes and complications associated with stroke increases with advanced age. Because the United States population is aging, the population at risk for stroke and recurrent events will increase over the coming decades. The high prevalence of stroke and its associated deficits impose a large burden on patients, their families, and the healthcare system. Optimizing post-acute care and secondary prevention efforts for stroke survivors represents an important target to reduce the burden of recurrent stroke, particularly among the elderly. Racial/ethnic and regional disparities have been identified for stroke incidence, prevalence, and mortality, but relatively little research has focused on potential disparities in the patterns of recurrent stroke events. The Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly study will use Medicare administrative data to achieve the following specific aims: 1) to assess temporal patterns in national recurrent stroke rates among elderly Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with ischemic stroke and describe disparities by sociodemographic and comorbid/clinical characteristics; and 2) to determine county-level rates of recurrent stroke, the persistence of geographic patterns over time, and county-level factors that may be contributing to disparities. Clinical practice, public policy, and reimbursement decisions are increasingly informed by data obtained from administrative datasets. The Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly study will be the largest contemporary investigation of recurrent stroke rates and patterns in the United States. Results from this project will identify geographic areas and subgroups that have distinctive health profiles that put them at high risk for recurrent stroke. Such information will inform care providers, insurers, public health agencies, and policy makers about communities that may derive the greatest benefit from targeted programs and community-based interventions. Results from the study will provide clinicians, investigators, and policymakers with national data on rates, trends, and patterns of recurrent stroke hospitalizations among the elderly, including variation among patient subgroups and geographic regions.",Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly,9670714,R01AG056628,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ',

"Metabolomic predictors of stroke in REGARDS Abstract There is a disproportionate burden of stroke among African Americans (AA) and individuals in the Southeastern United States, although the environmental and/or genetic underpinnings remain incompletely defined. Because metabolites integrate both environmental and genetic factors, they serve as proximal markers of human disease. In prior work supported by a Career Development Award, we established a rapid, multifunctional metabolomics platform that can be applied to large epidemiological cohorts. We now seek to focus our study on the metabolite predictors of cerebrovascular disease, an area that has received relatively little attention. To address these gaps in knowledge, we propose conducting metabolomics in stroke in the multiethnic REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke ( REGARDS) study, with further replication in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) and Framingham Heart Study (FHS). We will test the overarching hypothesis that metabolomics in well-phenotyped populations will illuminate stroke-associated metabolite pathways, and unravel racial differences among them. In Aim 1, we will identify metabolite risk factors for incident stroke, stratified by subtype, in the case-control cohort of the REGARDS study. We will profile metabolites from the baseline examination in ~1200 incident stroke cases and ~1200 controls matched for age, sex and race. In Aim 2, we will identify novel metabolite markers of known clinical risk traits for stroke, including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diet and exercise. In Aim 3, we will validate novel metabolite predictors of incident stroke and associated risk traits in the JHS and FHS cohorts. We will also test whether genetic variants that determine metabolite levels are in turn associated with clinical traits, through genetic risk score analysis. With extensive study data, the REGARDS study is uniquely positioned to catalyze the Aims of this proposal. Leveraging a novel small molecule profiling platform, our preliminary studies demonstrate the feasibility and significance of the Aims. Our multidisciplinary collaboration includes investigators at the MGH, UAB and University of Cincinnati, who bring collective expertise in metabolite profiling, biomarkers, genetic and population epidemiology, bioinformatics, metabolic traits, and health disparities. Finally, all data will be made publicly available, producing a unique scientific resource for the stroke research community. Narrative There are geographic and racial disparities in the burden of stroke across the United States. In this proposal, we will apply novel metabolite profiling techniques developed by our group to test the hypothesis that metabolomics will illuminate stroke-associated markers and unravel racial differences in that risk. These efforts have the potential to improve our ability to identify individuals at risk for stroke and improve the understanding of underlying mechanisms of disease.",Metabolomic predictors of stroke

"VCID and Stroke in a Bi-racial National Cohort PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia and stroke are substantially higher among blacks aged 45+, and among residents of the southeastern region of the US. The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study is national, longitudinal cohort study of ~ 30,000 blacks and whites designed to advance the understanding of the epidemiology of cognitive decline and stroke, and the contributors to racial and geographic disparities in these outcomes. The current application has three aims:  1. Identify social, cardiovascular, and environmental mechanisms of racial and geographic  disparities in incident vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID).  With assessment in mid-life and over a decade of longitudinal cognitive data, REGARDS is  uniquely positioned to identify vascular, social, and behavioral mechanisms underlying  disparities in VCID, and modifiable pathways on which interventions may narrow disparities  in VCID. After completion of a nested calibration/confirmation study to develop an algorithm  for the classification of MCI and dementia, we will characterize racial and geographic  disparities in VCID and determine if interventions on mediators would diminish or eliminate disparities.  2. Answer as-yet-unanswered questions in stroke and cerebrovascular disease epidemiology.  By continuing the successful approaches for stroke surveillance among 17000 active cohort  members, the study will assess the association of risk factor changes and novel biomarkers  quantified with the completion of the second in-person exam with stroke risk and disparities  in stroke risk. In addition, with the aging of the cohort, this aim will provide greatly needed  information on stroke epidemiology in the elderly.  3. Utilize incident risk factor data and biospecimens to identify pathways for development of  incident hypertension and diabetes, with the goal of understanding the impact on incident  VCID and stroke. We have documented that ≈30% of the racial disparity in stroke risk is  attributable to racial disparities in prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, and the study  will investigate the biomarker pathways contributing to the higher incidence of hypertension  and diabetes in blacks.  Each proposed aim addresses a topic of profound public health impact, and REGARDS  progress to date uniquely positions the study to address these aims using proven approaches  in an efficient manner.     Relevance    Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia and stroke are substantially higher among blacks aged 45 and older, and among persons who live in the southeastern region of the US. The reasons for these higher rates are poorly understood. Analyses of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and stroke from a national US cohort including persons with and without MCI, dementia, and stroke will help guide interventions to reduce these disparities.",VCID and Stroke in a Bi-racial National Cohort,9926922,U01NS041588,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Age Distribution ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' literacy ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Persons ', ' Paper ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Work ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' age group ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' vascular cognition impairment ', ' vascular cognitive decline ', ' vascular cognitive disease ', ' vascular cognitive dysfunction ', ' vascular contributions to cognitive impairment ', ' Vascular Cognitive Impairment ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' black/white disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' cardiac disease induced cognitive impairment ', ' vascular contributions to cognition/dementia ', ' vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia ', ' vascular cognitive impairment and dementia ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' risk for stroke ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' stroke event ', ' classification algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2020,3914560,0.2939043282381637
"Trends in mental health, use of mental health services and disparities among stroke survivors in the United States: 2004-2016 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The improvement in stroke survivorship over the past decades highlights the importance of post-stroke outcome research. Depression and psychological distress are among the most common post-stroke mental health conditions. Nearly one-third of stroke survivors experience depression at some point after stroke. Although the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines recommend screening and treatment for depression in stroke patients, post-stroke depression remains underdiagnosed and undermanaged. Depressive symptoms are not only disabling in their own right, but also interfere with functional recovery. Antidepressants, the first-line treatment for post-stroke depression, have also been increasingly prescribed for motor recovery in stroke rehabilitation settings in the past decade. However, recent randomized controlled trial evidence puts antidepressant use for functional outcomes under debate. Meanwhile, the dramatic increase in mental health service use in the general population since the 1990s may also have influenced trends in the stroke population. However, there is no population-level overview of mental health status and services use among stroke survivors in the United States, and little is known about mental health and mental health care disparities in the evolving context of stroke and stroke care. The overall goal of this proposal is to examine national trends in mental health, use of mental health services and disparities among stroke survivors from 2004 to 2016. Specifically, we will use nationally representative data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to examine (1) national trends in prevalence of depression and serious psychological distress, (2) national trends in use and underuse of mental health services, including psychotherapy and antidepressants, (3) potential differences in these trends across sociodemographic groups, and (4) the extent to which trends in mental health among stroke survivors are attributable to changes in their use of mental health services. Findings of the research will provide insights into gaps and opportunities in post- stroke mental health care, and identify vulnerable sociodemographic groups in need of increased attention. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will examine trends in post-stroke depression and psychological distress, use of antidepressants and psychotherapy, and potential differences in the trends across sociodemographic subgroups from 2004 to 2016 in the United States, using nationally representative data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Results from this study will provide the first national-level data on trends in mental health, use of mental health services and disparities among stroke survivors, and indicate possible directions for future intervention studies to improve well-being of the stroke population.","Trends in mental health, use of mental health services and disparities among stroke survivors in the United States: 2004-2016",9892332,R03NS111194,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Attention ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Beer ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Expenditure ', ' Fluoxetine ', ' Fluoxetin ', ' Prozac ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Future ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' survivorship ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' SSRI ', ' SSRIs ', ' Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ', ' serotonin reuptake inhibitor ', ' Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' stroke recovery ', ' functional outcomes ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' poststroke depression ', ' post stroke depression ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' motor recovery ', ' stroke survivor ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' American Stroke Association ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke outcome ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' screening guidelines ', ' socio-demographic groups ', ' sociodemographic group ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2020,156000,0.18132819687696752
"Family Study of Carotid Atherosclerosis and Stroke Risk Project Summary Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability in the US and disproportionally affects minority populations. Hispanics have a particularly high risk for stroke; this increased risk of stroke may be explained by specific genetic and non-genetic factors. Dominicans are the fastest growing Caribbean Hispanics in the US, and yet little is known about their genetic and non-genetic determinants of stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD). For the past 15 years, our team has been investigating stroke genetic risk factors in Dominicans. We have assembled a cohort of Dominican families at high risk of stroke and focused on stroke precursor phenotypes (SPPs) to reduce phenotypic heterogeneity and complexity of stroke etiology. We investigated well-recognized SPPs including carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, left ventricular mass, and left atrial diameter. We have successfully identified quantitative trait loci and DNA sequence variants associated with SPPs using high throughput genotyping and next generation sequencing. These findings account for a small portion of the inter- individual variation in SPPs. In this application, we propose to expand our investigations to conduct a methylome- wide-association-study (MWAS) to identify differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) associated with SPPs, stroke and CVD. Methylation is an epigenetic process that regulates gene expression without changing DNA sequence. DNA methylation has been shown as a key process contributing to the development of vascular disease. The proposed investigations would provide new insights relevant to the development of novel clinical strategies for prevention and treatment of stroke and CVD, as our ultimate goal is to reduce stroke risk and race- ethnic disparities in stroke and CVD. We plan 4 aims: Aim 1 to identify DMRs associated with stroke SPPs; Aim 2 to assess the relative contribution of genetic and non-genetic factors to SPP-associated DMRs; Aim3 to evaluate the functional impact of DNA sequence variation and DMRs using CRISPR-Cas9 technology; and Aim 4 to examine the predictive effect of SPP-associated DMRs on vascular events. To achieve these aims we will leverage the rich data already collected in the Family Study and add new data collection to detect vascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular death). We will validate the findings in an independent sample from the ongoing longitudinal Northern Manhattan Study, from which the Family Study originated. Both studies have used the same assessment tools and collection instruments for obtaining SPPs, lifestyle risk factors and genome-wide SNP data. The innovative aspects of our proposal include novel discoveries of modifiable epigenetic sites for stroke and CVD, CRISPR-Cas9 technology to model specific genome-editing, a unique population of Dominicans and a family study design, and an available independent population of Dominicans for validation studies. Findings from our study may lead to the most promising molecular strategies for risk stratification, prevention and treatment of stroke. Project Narrative Stroke is a major public health problem that disproportionally affects Hispanics. For over 15 years, we have been investigating genetic risk factors for stroke in Dominicans, one of the fastest growing sub-populations of Hispanics in the US. We propose an epigenetic study using our established Dominican cohorts.

"Trauma Communications Center Coordinated Severity-Based Stroke Triage Trauma Communication Center Coordinated Severity-Based Stroke Triage Acute stroke systems of care should emulate trauma systems which deliver the full range of care to all injured patients by means of organized, coordinated efforts in defined geographic areas. Just as trauma systems have proven ability to save lives of the most severely injured patients, we should have a stroke system able to provide care to patients with the most severe strokes. The most severe type of acute ischemic stroke is due to proximal large vessel occlusion (LVO). Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) offers an extraordinary potential to improve the outcome of patients with LVO. Unfortunately, in part because MT is available only at advanced stroke centers, only a minority of patients with LVO are treated with MT, and there are racial, socioeconomic, and rural disparities in access to MT. Based on the success of trauma systems and our prior collaboration, the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) is planning a five-year statewide quality improvement initiative of trauma communications center (TCC) coordinated severity-based stroke triage (SBST) which aims to transform the fragmented acute stroke care system by coordinating prehospital and inter-facility emergency stroke care. This provides a “natural experiment” allowing assessment of both the public health impact and the “how and why” of implementation of an innovative acute stroke care model. We aim to (1) compare the proportion of patients encountered by the emergency medical service (EMS) with suspected LVO who are treated with MT before (adhering to standard triage to the nearest stroke center) and after implementation of TCC coordinated SBST; (2) assess the broad public health impact of TCC coordinated SBST by examining the reach and effectiveness of the intervention (including any differences by race, ethnicity, and population density), the fidelity of implementation, and ability to sustain the model in various settings; and (3) assess stakeholder perceptions of the intervention’s feasibility, appropriateness, and acceptability and identify barriers and facilitators to the intervention’s adoption, implementation, maintenance, and spread. This will guide future implementation efforts. To accomplish these aims, we will expand our successful model of TCC guided stroke severity assessment to all EMS regions in Alabama; use qualitative methods including interviews and focus groups to aid in the development of region and hospital specific prehospital and inter- facility stroke triage plans for patients with suspected LVO; and implement a phased rollout of TCC coordinated SBST across Alabama’s six EMS regions, lending itself to analysis of health processes and outcomes before and after the intervention in each region. To address implementation AIM 3, we will use a mixed methods approach using multiple methods consisting of surveys, interviews and focus groups. This project, if successful, can serve as a model for how the trauma system infrastructure that already exists in other regions and states can serve as the basis for a more integrated and effective system of emergency stroke care.

"ICorps Administrative Supplement for A Remotely-Operated Robotic Endovascular Platform to Improve Thrombectomy Access Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) results from a blood clot in the neurovasculature. Currently, AIS remains the 5th leading cause of death in the United States (US) and is the leading cause of neurological disability. AIS will impact more than 700,000 Americans in 2018 and, despite the recent advances in stroke care, there still exists a 65% chance of death or severe disability. By 2030, it is expected that the US’s AIS economic burden will exceed $180B. Standard of care AIS therapies include the use of thrombolysis within 4.5 hours of stroke onset and thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions as early as possible. However, despite thrombectomy’s proven value, poor geographic access to early thrombectomy still results in a large disparity in care.  In the US, thrombectomies are largely performed at Comprehensive Stroke Centers (CSCs), for which there are less than 170. CSC certification is associated with extensive requirements, including access to high- level expertise, 24/7 access to care, dedicated neuro intensive care beds, on-site thrombectomy, CT/MR/CTA/MRA imaging, and participation in clinical research. Because considerable costs are associated with setting up and maintaining a CSC, these centers are concentrated near highly-populated urban centers, which can provide larger patient volumes. However, the consequence is that more than half of Americans face transfer times longer than 1hr, and for many, transfer delays can exceed 2hrs.  To help address this considerable gap in providing equal thrombectomy access to all Americans, the Joint Commission (in collaboration with the AHA/ASA) announced the Thrombectomy-Capable Stroke Center (TSC) certification program on January 1, 2018, with the goal of creating a geographically-dispersed thrombectomy- capable hospital network. However, building this TSC network will be a challenge given that 1) the associated costs in staffing a 24/7 TSC program will be high, 2) there are less than 3500 US neuroradiologists to draw from, and 3) the highest-level of expertise will likely remain concentrated within in high-volume CSCs.  UN&UP has invented a novel and remotely-enabled robotic technology that bolsters the Joint Commission’s TSC initiative. The technology’s innovation relates to the use of an angiosuite-compatible magnet-based workstation to navigate neurovascular tools composed of a unique magnetic alloy, which can be shaped into small, remotely-navigable guidewires and microcatheters. The result is a magnet-based robotic platform than is 40X smaller than previously possible and, for the first time, offers robotic solutions to the neurointerventionalist. UN&UP’s team consists of leading magnetics, robotics, telemedical, and stroke experts. The project’s aims include 1) building the prototype magnet workstation, 2) building novel magnetic guidewires and microcatheters, and 3) assessing device performance in vascular phantoms based upon CTA/MRA neurovascular datasets. Given strong FDA 510k predicates, the technology is expected to be regulated per the 510k framework. An FDA pre-submission meeting will be conducted in advance of a Phase II proposal. There are more than 700,000 annual acute ischemic strokes in the US, with thrombectomy recommended for proximal artery occlusions in the anterior circulation; however, the benefits of thrombectomy for stroke victims have been hampered by long transfer times to comprehensive stroke centers. To improve thrombectomy access, the Joint Commission partnered with the American Heart Association and the American Stoke Association to launch the “Thrombectomy-Capable Stroke Center” program in early 2018; however, the substantial cost associated with staffing a low-volume, geographically-dispersed thrombectomy service that provides 24/7 access to highly-skilled neurointerventionalists will be an obstacle for this much-needed program. To address this gap in care, UN&UP (short for “Unmet Needs and Underserved Populations”) will demonstrate proof of concept of its cost-effective robotic interventional neuroradiology platform in this Phase I SBIR application which helps provides early thrombectomy access to all Americans by enabling stroke experts to guide thrombectomy procedures regardless of their geographic availability.",ICorps Administrative Supplement for A Remotely-Operated Robotic Endovascular Platform to Improve Thrombectomy Access,10045638,R43NS112035,"['Alloys ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Beds ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Blood coagulation ', ' Blood Clotting ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Certification ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cobalt ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Equipment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fluoroscopy ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Joints ', ' Medical Device ', ' Modernization ', ' Neurology ', ' Patients ', ' Platinum ', ' Platinum Black ', ' Pt element ', ' Robotics ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Thrombectomy ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Anterior ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Arterial Obstruction ', ' Arterial Occlusion ', ' Artery Obstruction ', ' artery occlusion ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' thrombolysis ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke therapy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' cost effective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' prototype ', ' standard of care ', ' operation ', ' certificate program ', ' neuro-vascular ', ' neurovascular ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' stroke victims ', ' acute care ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNANDUP, LLC",R43,2020,55000,0.33065425058487863
"Defining Trajectories of Linguistic, Cognitive-Communicative and Quality of Life Outcomes in Aphasia Stroke imposes significant burdens on the health and quality of life terms of healthcare costs and lost productivity. Aphasia adds to the cost of stroke related care. Many stroke survivors with aphasia receive therapy in inpatient rehabilitation facilities. However, aphasia recovery is variable and there is limited evidence on the benefits of inpatient rehabilitation on outcomes. The objective of the parent R01 is to describe the trajectories of linguistic, cognitive-communicative, and health-related quality of life outcomes following stroke in persons with aphasia during inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation to 18 months following stroke. A sample of 300 consecutively- admitted stroke patients with aphasia recruited at three Midwestern rehabilitation hospitals will complete measures of linguistic and cognitive-communicative performance, and the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders Measurement System instruments during rehabilitation and at 6-,12-, and 18- months post-stroke. We will model outcomes as individual and group trajectories, allowing us to develop individual predictions which could inform clinical planning and decision-making for new patients. The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in drastic changes in therapy access and utilization since we launched this study. As a result, patients with aphasia may not receive any inpatient or outpatient speech and language therapy, their lengths of stay or therapy schedules may be shortened, or therapies may be offered only through telerehabilitation. Thus, the Specific Aims of this supplement are to:  1. Characterize the Covid-19 experience and telerehabilitation access, service delivery experiences, and  perceived effectiveness in a large national cohort of adults with aphasia.  2. Describe the nature and extent of disparities in telerehabilitation service delivery related to sex, race,  ethnicity, age, and insurance coverage.  3. Compare the cognitive-communicative and psychosocial health outcomes at 6, 12 and 18 months post-  stroke achieved by patients in our longitudinal cohort study (R01 DC017174) receiving telerehabilitation  vs. in-person vs. no services following discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. We request a supplement for two years, given the longitudinal nature of the parent R01 grant. At the end of the supplement, results for Aims 1 and 2 will be available. Descriptive results will be available for Aim 3 on a cohort of about 50 participants followed to 18 months post-stroke, which will be sufficient to allow for a proof of concept descriptive analysis, and eventual 300 by the end of the parent R01 for a complete analysis. This supplement demonstrates innovation in that SLP telerehabilitation is relatively new. Outside of controlled research studies, its benefits and limitations have not been assessed. An improved understanding of aphasia recovery may assist with prognosis, allowing patients and caregivers to plan, helping clinicians choose appropriate therapies, providing benchmarks against which to measure change, and allowing therapy modifications when patients do not attain benchmarks. Project Narrative This project addresses telerehabilitation services in both a large national survey of adults with aphasia and in participants in our longitudinal cohort study of aphasia that assesses cognitive- communicative and psychosocial health outcomes at 6, 12 and 18 months poststroke.","Defining Trajectories of Linguistic, Cognitive-Communicative and Quality of Life Outcomes in Aphasia",10238189,R01DC017174,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Communication ', ' Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Language ', ' Language Therapy ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Licensure ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Persons ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Parents ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Productivity ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Speech ', ' Speech-Language Pathology ', ' Speech Therapy ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' improved ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Survivors ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Auditory ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' rehabilitation service ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' research study ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Improve Access ', ' Measurable ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' functional gain ', ' tele-rehabilitation ', ' telerehab ', ' telerehabilitation ', ' patient population ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' federal policy ', ' public health emergency ', ' waiver ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' behavioral economics ', ' recovery in aphasia ', ' aphasia recovery ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' service delivery ', ' insurance plan ', ' health assessment ', ' stroke patient ', ' aphasia due to stroke ', ' aphasia following stroke ', ' poststroke aphasia ', ' stroke aphasia ', ' stroke survivor with aphasia ', ' stroke-induced aphasia ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' ']",NIDCD,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2020,177886,0.22905966492266483
"DISPLACE: Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment Project Abstract Ischemic stroke is a potentially preventable, devastating complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), a group of inherited blood disorders that affect close to 100,000 individuals in the United States. Without intervention, stroke may occur in up to 24% of individuals with the highest risk form of SCD, sickle cell anemia. Despite improvements in comprehensive care and management of SCD in children, stroke remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to insufficient screening and prevention practices. Individuals living with SCD continue to face multiple health disparities cause by racial and socioeconomic factors as well as disease- specific disparities in funding and private sector support. In order to standardize and improve care, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) released evidence-based guidelines in 2014. These guidelines established routine transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) screening as a means for identifying children at high risk of stroke and indefinite chronic red cell transfusions (CRCT) as a means of treating children at high risk for stroke based on the previous NHLBI funded, randomized controlled STOP (Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Disease) results. This proposal, entitled DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) is a multi-site effort focused on enhancing the implementation and dissemination of these evidence-based stroke prevention guidelines in SCD. The research approach is guided by the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation and the multilevel ecological model of health. The DISPLACE leadership core at the Medical University of South Carolina is a multidisciplinary team lead by Dr. Julie Kanter, Dr. Robert Adams and Dr. Cathy Melvin and includes specialists in multicenter clinical trial design, hematology, implementation science, qualitative analysis and statistical evaluation. The Data Coordinating Unit (DCU) at MUSC who have coordinated over 40 multicenter studies and will provide study design and information technology support and data management support the leadership core. The aims of DISPLACE are to: 1) assess the gap between current and guideline- recommended practices for stroke prevention among pediatric patients with SCD, 2) assess the multi-level patient, provider, and systems barriers and enablers to performing TCD screening and initiating CRCT, and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of a novel multi-level dissemination and implementation strategy to increase current annual TCD screening rates and CRCT initiation rates using a parallel cluster-randomized clinical trial. We have assembled a large, multi-institutional collaboration of institutions with widespread geographic distribution to best assess the feasibility and utility of the multi-level implementation strategy. The long-term goal of DISPLACE is to ensure that all children with SCD receive guideline-based care for stroke prevention for a “stroke free generation” in SCD. Project Narrative Stroke is a potentially preventable, devastating complication in individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD), a blood disorder which a primarily affects a minority population in the United States. This proposal, entitled DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) is the first multi-site effort focused on enhancing the implementation and dissemination of evidence-based stroke prevention guidelines in sickle cell disease.

"Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites PROJECT SUMMARY:  We seek to continue our population-based study of stroke incidence and case fatality, prevalence of risk factors, stroke treatment, and post-stroke outcomes within a biracial metropolitan population of 1,368,604 of whom 223,417 (16.3%) are of black race (US Census 2010). We expect to identify ~4500 physician confirmed and well characterized stroke events (projected 2900 ischemic strokes, 525 hemorrhagic strokes, and 1075 transient ischemic attack [TIA]) among residents of the five-county Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky (GCNK) region at all 20 regional hospitals/EDs for the period 7/1/2019 to 12/31/2020, as well as 2,000 survey participants.  For almost 25 years, we have studied trends in stroke incidence and case fatality and have demonstrated a racial disparity where stroke incidence in African-Americans is more than double that of whites. In each prior study period, we have also examined the prevalence of risk factors (and knowledge of stroke) via a population survey in order to put our temporal trend findings into context.  In addition to continuing these important activities, we also examined stroke recurrence in a population- based fashion in our prior study period, finding that blacks were more likely to have recurrent events than whites. We now seek to evaluate temporal trends in recurrence rates, and specifically racial disparities in those temporal trends. Previously we had piloted methods of obtaining a population-based outcome among stroke patients, and we are now ready to obtain outcomes after ischemic stroke across our entire population, data that are desperately needed in the field. Finally, we have used our data to inform eligibility for stroke clinical trials via a close collaboration with NIH StrokeNet and have shared our data with the scientific community for this purpose. By obtaining more detailed outcomes data, we will now be able to better inform proposed recovery and prevention trials as well. RELEVANCE: The change in stroke occurrence and recurrence over time is the ultimate test of how well science has translated new discoveries into benefits for the population. Our study has examined racial disparities in stroke over the last 25 years, showing that blacks have higher risk for stroke than whites. In our population, the occurrence of stroke is decreasing in whites but NOT African-Amerians, and we will continue to describe trends in stroke occurrence, recurrence, cause, treatment, and outcome in a biracial metropolitan population.",Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites,9887666,R01NS030678,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Black race ', ' Censuses ', ' Transient Ischemic Attack ', ' Brain TIA ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Kentucky ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' County ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Case Series ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Attenuated ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke therapy ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' stroke recovery ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' poststroke depression ', ' post stroke depression ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' Prevention trial ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' rate of change ', ' biracial ', ' disparities in sex ', ' sex disparity ', ' stroke intervention ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Time trend ', ' stroke patient ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke incidence ', ' risk for stroke ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' stroke outcome ', ' stroke clinical trials ', ' stroke event ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R01,2020,1564515,0.4588929657240474
"Identifying sleep targets to improve stroke outcomes Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States and the second leading cause of mortality worldwide. The impact of stroke goes well beyond visible disability. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are now recognized as critical assessments of post-stroke outcomes. Important PROs such as fatigue, depression, and pain affect approximately half of stroke survivors and predict post-stroke disability, higher burden of care, and worse physical health but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Surprisingly, the contributions of poor or inadequate sleep to PROs including post-stroke fatigue and traditional stroke outcomes have not been well-studied but have direct implications for screening and treatment. This application represents an ancillary study to the highly successful, ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project (R01 NS38916), recently renewed through March 2024. In this population-based stroke surveillance study within a Texan bi-ethnic county, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed and followed prospectively for 90- day outcomes, including a comprehensive set of PROs. This unique epidemiologic sample, with equal representation of non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans, allows for the exploration of effects of disrupted sleep on fatigue and stroke outcomes in general and specifically in Mexican Americans, a subgroup with higher stroke risk and worse stroke outcomes. This will be accomplished through application of state-of- the-art comprehensive but feasible portable polysomnography and the addition of measures of post-stroke fatigue to the BASIC Project. Incorporating polysomnography into our large, population-based stroke study significantly enhances the feasibility to obtain detailed sleep metrics in the stroke population. This study will represent the largest longitudinal study to-date of full polysomnography among stroke patients. These highly translational aims will examine in a systematic manner the physiologic insight and clinical utility provided by polysomnography in relation to traditional and more patient-relevant stroke outcomes. Identification of sleep measures associated with poor stroke outcomes will identify potential treatment targets for stroke recovery and a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity. Project Narrative Leveraging the infrastructure of the parent BASIC project, we propose the largest study of polysomnography among stroke patients. This population-based study will comprehensively study sleep after stroke and assess associations with important stroke outcomes, including patient related outcomes, for the first time. This study will identify potential novel treatment targets for stroke recovery and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Identifying sleep targets to improve stroke outcomes,10001822,R01HL152741,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interview ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' mortality ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep Apnea Syndromes ', ' Sleep Apnea ', ' Sleep Hypopnea ', ' Sleep-Disordered Breathing ', ' sleep-related breathing disorder ', ' Sleep Deprivation ', ' deficient sleep ', ' inadequate sleep ', ' insufficient sleep ', ' sleep debt ', ' sleep deficiency ', ' sleep deficit ', ' sleep insufficiency ', ' sleep loss ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' poor sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Wakefulness ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Sleep Monitoring ', ' Somnography ', ' polysomnographic ', ' sleep measurement ', ' sleep polysomnography ', ' Polysomnography ', ' improved ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Delta Wave ', ' Delta Wave sleep ', ' Slow-Wave Sleep ', ' Measurement ', ' Investigation ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' sleep diseases ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Sampling ', ' sleep onset ', ' portability ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Consequentialism ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Subgroup ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' care burden ', ' Sleep Architecture ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' population based ', ' surveillance study ', ' screening ', ' stroke survivor ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' translational impact ', ' stroke patient ', ' risk for stroke ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' stroke outcome ', ' Infrastructure ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,367320,0.43769342936617556
"A Community Based Participatory Trial to Increase Stroke Treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-stroke disability represents a significant public health problem. Currently, there are over 7 million stroke survivors in the US, most of whom have persistent disability. Despite the fact that acute stroke treatments dramatically reduce post-stroke disability and are cost saving, they are markedly underutilized. There is no region in the US where acute stroke treatments are more underutilized than in Flint, Michigan. Flint is an urban, underserved city with nearly 100,000 residents of whom about 60% are African American. One of the main reasons for acute stroke treatment underutilization is pre-hospital delay-patients arrive to the hospital too late to receive the treatment. For the past 6 years, the Community Health Partnership-composed of academic partners from the University of Michigan and community partners, Bridges into the Future-has worked to increase acute stroke treatment rates in Flint by decreasing pre-hospital delay. The Community Health Partnership completed several community needs assessments, and from those designed and tested a peer-led, health behavior theory-based intervention in African American churches. The intervention focused on increasing stroke preparedness (i.e., increasing community member's recognition of stroke warning signs and the importance of calling 911 immediately for stroke). This community intervention, Stroke Ready, successfully increased stroke preparedness. The current application represents the larger scale adaption and testing of the Stroke Ready intervention to increase the Flint community's acute stroke treatment rates. Stroke Ready, now expanded to a multi-level intervention, aims to increase acute stroke treatment through both community stroke preparedness and Emergency Department readiness. The Stroke Ready community intervention will adapt and expand the Stroke Ready pilot intervention consisting of interactive workshops and a stroke music video to newly include community-wide education activities such as social media and mass print media. We will also collaborate with a Flint safety-net hospital, where the majority of stroke patients are African American that is in great need of improved acute stroke care, to optimize treatment pathways. The primary outcome of the project will be change in acute stroke treatments, which will directly benefit the entire community by reducing post-stroke disability. Sustainability will be achieved in Flint by training of peer-leaders, wide dissemination of Stroke Ready materials, ease of administering the intervention, hospital improvements and continued commitment and engagement of the Community Advisory Board. The products of this application include a strategy to improve acute stroke treatments in safety-net hospitals and the easy to deliver Stroke Ready community intervention to allow for sustainability and dissemination.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If acute stroke treatments are given soon after the start of a stroke, they can reduce the chance that stroke survivors are left with disability. Yet few stroke patients, particularly African Americans, receive these treatments. In this project, community and academic researchers will work together to increase the number of patients who receive acute stroke treatments in the predominately African American community of Flint, Michigan.        ",A Community Based Participatory Trial to Increase Stroke Treatment,9938326,U01MD010579,"['Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Michigan ', ' Music ', ' Patients ', ' Printed Media ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Acute ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Relative Risks ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Church ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' theories ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke therapy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' community intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' stroke recovery ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' safety net ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' implementation science ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' successful intervention ', ' 911 call ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' social media ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke symptom ', ' urban underserved ', ' recruit ', ' therapy optimization ', ' treatment optimization ', ' stroke patient ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke incidence ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,557952,0.45767615548086965
"Health Equity & Actionable Disparities in Stroke: Understanding & Problem-solving (HEADS-UP) Symposium ABSTRACT There is a striking disparity in the burden of stroke for race-ethnic minorities (African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans vs. Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) in the United States (US). The impact of these disparities translates to huge economic costs for the US. Adding to the sense of urgency is a substantial projected future widening of stroke prevalence in the US for race-ethnic minorities. As a society, we need to have a better understanding of the causes for these disparities, and test solutions to reduce them, but too few studies to date have demonstrated substantial reductions in stroke outcome disparities. Moreover, fostering the successful development of the next generation of stroke disparities researchers is crucial to resolving this growing challenge. The Health Equity & Actionable Disparities in Stroke: Understanding & Problem-solving (HEADS-UP) symposium, is a multidisciplinary forum focused on race-ethnic disparities in cerebrovascular disease, with the overarching goal of reducing disparities in stroke and accelerating translation of research findings to improve outcomes for race-ethnic minorities who reside in the US. HEADS-UP 2020 will be held on February 18, 2020 in Los Angeles, California, featuring plenary talks by distinguished researchers, career development activities, and poster sessions. HEADS-UP 2020 will focus on the various determinants of racial stroke disparities. HEADS-UP 2020 is a collaborative initiative with the American Stroke Association (ASA) and will occur a day before the start of the ASA’s two and half International Stroke Conference, the premier global stroke science meeting, where > 5000 stroke scientists from all over the world gather to present their research & network. Involvement of ASA brings to this important effort, wide access to relevant scientific disciplines, volunteer engagement from leaders in the field, financial support, worthwhile in-kind resources, and proven experience in implementing high impact programs. Basic scientists, translational researchers and clinicians, seasoned investigators and early career scientists will be invited, but a major emphasis is to encourage active involvement of an early career cohort of investigators. HEADS-UP 2020 Specific Aims are: To host a forum which will identify knowledge gaps and provide opportunities for researchers from diverse disciplines to discuss cutting-edge research about race-ethnic disparities in stroke; 2) To accelerate collaborations via networking opportunities among stakeholders; 3) To award travel scholarships to 20 multidisciplinary Post-Doctoral Scholars from a national pool from diverse professional backgrounds committed to stroke disparities research careers; 4) To disseminate knowledge generated from HEADS-UP via scientific & public venues; 5) To evaluate effectiveness of HEADS-UP by assessing number of attendees, and Young Awardee Achievements. Narrative We need to enhance our collective ability to reduce the overall immense burden of stroke on society, and its disproportionate toll on race-ethnic minorities. The goal of this one-day symposium in February 2020 is to partner with the pre-eminent national stroke society to encourage more research into disparities around stroke, by providing leading edge science aimed particularly at scientists from various professional and scientific disciplines, with an interest in health equity and disparities research. Special efforts will be made to sponsor some early career scientists and invite under-represented in medicine minority scholars to participate.",Health Equity & Actionable Disparities in Stroke: Understanding & Problem-solving (HEADS-UP) Symposium,9914811,R13NS116993,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' California ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Financial Support ', ' financial assistance ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Scholarship ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Science ', ' Seasons ', ' Societies ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Schedule ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Discipline ', ' Recovery ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Fostering ', ' Logistics ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Native Americans ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' economic cost ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' International ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' virtual ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' volunteer ', ' health equity ', ' population health ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' Minority Participation ', ' social media ', ' Workplace Diversity ', ' Diverse Workforce ', ' improved outcome ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' minority scientist ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' translational investigator ', ' translational researcher ', ' translational scientist ', ' translational clinician ', ' translational physician ', ' American Stroke Association ', ' stroke model ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke incidence ', ' stroke outcome ', ' health goals ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NINDS,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R13,2020,45000,0.4033025379177457
"The University of Iowa's Regional Stroke Research Network The University of Iowa (UI) Regional Stroke Research Network meets the goal of NIH StrokeNet in maximizing efficiencies to develop, promote, and conduct high quality multi-site clinical trials testing promising interventions in stroke prevention, treatment, and recovery.

"Disparities in Transition of Care after Acute Stroke Hospitalization: The Transition of Care Stroke Disparity Study (TCSD-S) Stroke, together with heart disease, accounts for the largest proportion of non-communicable diseases and deaths worldwide. In the US, there are 795,000 annual stroke cases and 150,000 deaths from stroke. Numbers will steeply increase with the aging population. Stroke remains the main cause of serious long-term disability with minorities being affected disproportionally. Greater risk of stroke exists among blacks and Hispanics at younger ages; blacks have greater stroke mortality. Though measures of quality of stroke care during acute hospitalization have improved, little evidence exists on the quality of processes leading to effective stroke prevention and rehabilitation after hospital discharge. Unexpected hospital readmissions 30 days after acute stroke hospitalization are common, as high as 25%, and lead to excess morbidity and cost. Stroke impact on patients', families', and communities' quality of life, and the burden on use and cost of health care is enormous. We propose the Transitions of Care Stroke Disparity Study (TCSD-S) with the main objective to identify race- ethnic and sex disparities in hospital-to-home transition of stroke care and outcomes, social determinants of health associated with these disparities, and to develop effective hospital-initiated system level initiatives to reduce disparities and readmissions, and to improve stroke outcomes. To achieve this objective, we will capitalize on the rich infrastructure and resources of our unique Florida Stroke Registry (FSR), which includes a well-developed network of hospitals, health providers, partnership with the AHA, and other Florida stakeholders. We will evaluate medication adherence, healthy lifestyle, utilization of rehabilitation interventions and medical follow-up 30 days after hospital discharge to home across representative Florida Comprehensive Stroke Centers. A novel Transitions of Stroke Care Performance Index (TOSC PI) will be derived and validated. Thi index will be a primary outcome together with hospital readmissions and stroke outcomes (disability, recurrence, cardiovascular events, and death). Data on TOSC and stroke outcomes will be collected by structured telephone interviews at 30 and 90 days after discharge and review of patient charts. Predictors of TOSC disparities and outcomes will be evaluated using baseline in-hospital data of the index stroke obtained from the FSR, and Social Determinants of Health obtained through a novel data collection instrument from publicly available records. Based on identified predictors of TOSC disparities, we will develop and assess the feasibility of initiatives to reduce TOSC disparities, targeting systems of care with a TOSC disparities dashboard, and health care providers with a training module for enhanced patient education and support at discharge and during follow-up. We will compare the TOSC PI and outcomes before and after the initiatives. The successful completion of this study will identify disparities in hospital-to-home TOSC, define key predictors of poor TOSC and stroke outcomes, and develop initiatives which will be scalable across health systems and which will address disparities, readmission rates, and poor outcomes. Project Narrative Despite improvements in the in-hospital treatment of acute stroke, readmissions, recurrent stroke, and disability remain common and affect minorities disproportionally as transition of care from hospital to home may be suboptimal. This project will define race/ethnic and sex disparities in transitions of care from hospital to home after stroke, identify modifiable factors, and develop initiatives that impact the health care system and educate health care providers to reduce disparities and improve outcomes after stroke. This project is relevant as it targets an understudied aspect of stroke care during transition of care from hospital to home, and may result in reductions of stroke recurrence, disability, readmissions, and disparities in care.  ",Disparities in Transition of Care after Acute Stroke Hospitalization: The Transition of Care Stroke Disparity Study (TCSD-S),9956622,R01MD012467,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Family ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Morbidity -

"Program to Avoid Cerebrovascular Events Through Systematic Electronic Tracking and Tailoring of an Eminent Risk-factor (PACESETTER) Racial and rural-urban disparities in stroke care and outcomes are most prominent in the Southeastern region of the US, where 3 states have long been recognized as representing the `buckle' of a `stroke belt', i.e. highly stroke-prone tri-state area within a broader region already more heavily burdened with stroke compared to the rest of the country. One of these 3 states is South Carolina (SC). Fortunately, stroke is eminently preventable and hypertension (HTN) is the premier modifiable risk factor for stroke, but fewer than one third of patients with a recent stroke have their blood pressure (BP) controlled ≥75% of the time and low consistency of BP control is linked to higher risk of future major vascular events. Key factors responsible for uncontrolled HTN in African Americans (AA) are medication non-adherence and failure to intensify therapy in a timely manner. As such, culturally-tailored, efficacious blood pressure control programs which are acceptable, feasible, timely, and sustainable are needed, especially among hypertensive stroke survivors who reside in the stroke buckle or who are AA. Mobile health (mHealth) technology offers a promising approach to address this need. The overall objective of the Program to Avoid Cerebrovascular Events through Systematic Electronic Tracking and Tailoring of an Eminent Risk-factor (PACESETTER) study is to demonstrate that a theoretical-model- based, mHealth technology-centered, multi-level integrated approach can be effectively implemented to improve sustained BP control among stroke patients encountered in South Carolina (at least half of whom will be AA) within one month of stroke symptom onset. The primary aim is conduct an implementation trial (at the patient level) of the PACESETTER intervention [health technology (personalized phone text messaging and home BP monitoring)] vs. usual care in 200 recent stroke patients with hypertension recruited across the three main safety net hospitals in the state of SC (in the cities of Charleston, Columbia, and Greenville). Primary outcome will be achievement of guideline-recommended systolic blood pressure control at 12 months. We also aim to explore whether implementation of the PACESETTER intervention vs. standard care is associated with a reduction in subsequent cardiovascular event-related re-hospitalizations, shows a signal of potential efficacy in reducing actual vascular events, and has distinct effects on providers caring for patients with stroke. Altogether, the PACESETTER intervention, if proven effective and implementable, may eventually be exported to other medically underserved populations in the US beyond SC, as a feasible model of evidence-based post-stroke management. Stroke is a major public health problem leading to death, disability, and dementia. African Americans and people who live in the Southeastern region of the United States (US) experience a higher rate of stroke compared to people of other races and US regions; however, stroke is very preventable and adequately treating hypertension has the biggest effect on stroke prevention. This research seeks to test a mobile- phone and home monitoring based strategy for improving the currently poor control of hypertension among patients (half of whom will be African American) at high risk for future stroke in South Carolina, a State with an especially high rate of deaths from stroke.",Program to Avoid Cerebrovascular Events Through Systematic Electronic Tracking and Tailoring of

"Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project Abstract While stroke incidence and mortality are declining in the United States (US), Mexican Americans still have a much higher stroke burden with higher incidence and recurrence, worse neurologic, functional and cognitive outcome, and newly projected higher mortality following stroke. Mexican Americans are the most numerous sub-group of Hispanic Americans, the largest minority population in the US. This important group is aging, growing rapidly, and spreading throughout the country. This renewal application of the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project will facilitate a quarter century population-based examination of stroke trends in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites, including, for the first time, consideration of trends in neurologic, functional, cognitive and quality of life outcomes. This data is crucial for public health planning and monitoring the effectiveness of interventions. The overwhelming majority of stroke patients have long-term sequelae from their stroke that impact their well-being. For the first time, BASIC will investigate outcomes that are important to patients and their caregivers using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), a well validated tool developed under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health and recommended by a stroke expert panel. This new data collection will yield critical data as the first step in developing interventions to improve stroke outcome and reduce stroke’s impact in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Additionally, we will link more than a decade’s worth of data from BASIC with multiple large administrative datasets, including the Texas State Inpatient Research Data File and Emergency Department Dataset and Medicare data, to study ethnic-specific missed opportunities for primary and secondary prevention, such as emergency department visits where atrial fibrillation is noted but not acted upon prior to stroke. We will also examine post-stroke resource utilization to identify areas to improve stroke outcomes and reduce ethnic disparities. In sum, BASIC will continue to provide the only ongoing, uninterrupted stroke surveillance in Mexican Americans; we will focus on ethnic differences and similarities in patient reported outcomes aimed towards designing interventions to improve outcomes; and we will create a stroke “big data” resource combining the strengths of BASIC’s validated stroke events with detailed clinical data and healthcare utilization information from administrative data to prevent stroke and improve outcome. BASIC has amassed a cohort of over 11,000 stroke patients since January 1, 2000, and we add an additional 450 each year. In addition to the rich publication record and numerous spin-off projects, BASIC has just begun to fully take advantage of this precious stroke patient resource. Project Narrative The Mexican American population in the United States is rapidly growing and aging. This project extends the highly successful Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC), the only population-based stroke study in Mexican Americans, to study quarter-century stroke trends, newly investigate ethnic-specific patient-reported outcomes, and link BASIC with administrative data to seek out strategies for primary and secondary stroke prevention and improved recovery. The result will be a crucial understanding of the stroke burden in Mexican Americans and insight into new ways to reduce ethnic stroke disparities.",Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project,9896872,R01NS038916,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Planning ', ' plan health ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Inpatients ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Politics ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Data Files ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mortality Decline ', ' tool ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' cohort ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Subgroup ', ' Sum ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' population based ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' improved outcome ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' Long-term trends ', ' Longer-term trends ', ' Longerterm trends ', ' Longterm trends ', ' Longitudinal trends ', ' data resource ', ' hospital re-admission rates ', ' hospital readmission rate ', ' re-admission rates ', ' re-hospitalization rate ', ' rehospitalization rate ', ' readmission rates ', ' stroke patient ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke incidence ', ' stroke outcome ', ' stroke event ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,2082648,0.37566000152756046
"Molecular mechanisms of excitotoxic neurodegeneration: Novel death pathways in C. elegans Stroke / brain ischemia is a leading cause of death, and survivors require extensive long-term rehabilitation and care. Stroke is also a major source of medical disparity. The study of the mechanism neuronal damage in brain ischemia has seen many setbacks, since some critical events typically happen before admission to the emergency department. At the molecular level, key events include synaptic accumulation of glutamate, hyper-stimulation of postsynaptic receptors, Ca2+ influx, functional mitochondrial collapse, and cellular disintegration in a process called excitotoxicity. In spite of extensive efforts to develop intervention strategies, identified canonical events take place too early to be treated in the clinic, while subsequent proposed events remain highly controversial and scenario-specific. We now study these later steps in the C. elegans animal model system, under the premise that events that are conserved through large evolutionary distances are likely to be key steps in the essential core of the degenerative process. We take advantage of the particularly powerful set of technologies available in this model system. We hypothesize that while a number of signaling cascades converge on the mitochondria to produce excitotoxic necrosis, two novel effects are particularly important: 1) we identify a scantly studied mechanism where the Ca2+ sensitive kinase DAPK cooperates with p53 to cause necrosis by translocation of p53 into the mitochondrial matrix, interaction with CypD, and opening of the mitochondrial inner membrane’s mPTP. 2) we suggest that overstimulation of the mitochondria (following the excessive depolarization of the postsynaptic neurons) causes buildup of mitochondrial lipid peroxides, leading to membrane damage and cellular necrosis by ferroptosis. Finally, we suggest that additional novel mechanisms could be identified by an unbiased screen designed to detect new, previously unappreciated mechanisms in excitotoxic necrosis. We aim to study the DAPK/mitochondrial p53/CypD/mPTP axis by combining imaging, genetic KOs, and conditional expression. We will use similar approaches to study mitochondrial ferroptosis in excitotoxicity. Depending on progress in the previous aims, we will characterize novel mutants that show suppressed or enhanced excitotoxic necrosis. We will illuminate conserved, novel, and non-immediate mechanisms of neuronal damage in excitotoxicity. We hope these insights can later be used to develop new intervention strategies in stroke, a major cause of medical disparity. Relevance to human health: This project addressed stroke, a critical unmet need in healthcare with particular significance of minority populations. The life-threatening initial condition, and the devastating effects on quality of life for stroke survivors, call for a concerted effort to find new intervention strategies. We illuminate novel non-immediate mechanisms in stroke-related excitotoxicity and address core processes likely to be conserved across many forms of this neurodegenerative process. Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability, pressing the need to find novel intervention strategies in a clinically feasible time-frame. Stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, with disparate prevalence and worse outcomes in minority communities. We suggest novel mechanisms of mitochondrial collapse that might mediate the process of excitotoxic neurodegeneration in stroke, processes that take place at later stages of stroke progression and might therefore be available for targeting in therapeutic interventions. We take advantage of a particularly powerful set of research tools available in the animal model system of the nematode, where conserved core cell death processes are easier to decipher but are still highly informative in the development of clinical intervention strategies.",Molecular mechanisms of excitotoxic neurodegeneration: Novel death pathways in C.

"Assessing Population-based Radiological brain health in Stroke Epidemiology (APRISE) Study DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT: Stroke recurrence is a major public health problem. It has been understudied epidemiologically despite comprising ~25% of all stroke in the US, and leading to higher morbidity and mortality compared to initial events. Furthermore, compared to our understanding of the role of traditional risk factors for first stroke, we have limited understanding of the risk factors for recurrent stroke. Radiological measures of small vessel and large-vessel disease may provide a measure of a subject’s current “Brain Health” to predict future cerebrovascular events and vascular dementia. Understanding small vessel disease in particular—manifesting as white matter hyperintensity, microbleeds, lacunar infarcts, dilated perivascular spaces, and brain atrophy–is a top NINDS priority. Although the Framingham risk score is widely used for clinical decision-making, and the ABCD scores predict 90-day stroke risk among minor stroke/TIA patients, no clinical prediction tool in a broader ischemic or a hemorrhagic stroke population-based cohort has been established. A Framingham-like “Risk Function Tool for Secondary Stroke,” especially one incorporating the full gamut of modern imaging parameters developed in a racially diverse population, would likely identify high-risk patients for targeted education interventions, novel antithrombotics, and aggressive clinical care. Moreover, it may reveal novel causal pathways and risk factors for future investigation. We propose an ancillary study to the ongoing Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study (GCKNSS) entitled APRISE (Assessing Population-based Radiological brain health in Stroke Epidemiology). Our objective is to build on the GCNKSS infrastructure to radiologically characterize the full stroke/TIA population of Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky from 2015 and create the first modern, largely MRI-based characterization of brain health in a contemporary stroke/TIA population. Our specific aim is to create a prediction model of cerebrovascular disease recurrence (ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke) incorporating imaging parameters in a biracial, large-scale ischemic stroke/TIA population using state-of-the-art modeling approaches. We will achieve these goals by radiologically characterizing the stroke/TIA population (~2700 ischemic and ~525 hemorrhagic stroke, and ~1025 TIA patients) in the NIH-funded GCNKSS of a 1.4 million, biracial population. We will leverage the extensive GCNKSS infrastructure, which is already in place to detect recurrent stroke, placing us in a unique position to develop a recurrent stroke risk model using newly acquired radiologic data with remarkable efficiency. The proposed study will allow the first and only population-based characterization of the entire imaging spectrum of brain health in stroke/TIA patients.

"Mechanisms underlying race disparities in gastrostomy placement after stroke Project Summary/Abstract Racial differences in the utilization of therapeutic procedures in stroke patients are pervasive and contribute to worse outcomes in minorities compared to whites after stroke. Swallowing dysfunction immediately after stroke is common, but most patients recover adequate swallowing function within a few days or weeks. Percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) tubes for enteral feeding are commonly placed for patients who are perceived unlikely to recover adequate swallowing function in a timely manner, but ideally are avoided as PEG placement is invasive, carries the risk of procedure-related complications, and has been associated with poor long-term outcomes. Clinical decision-making surrounding PEG placement lacks objective and standardized criteria, but is largely dependent on clinical swallowing evaluations by Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) providers, and use of ancillary radiographic swallow studies such as a videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS). The PI’s preliminary data show that PEG tubes are overutilized in minorities compared to whites despite similar stroke severity, medical comorbidities, and incidence of swallowing dysfunction. The research proposed in the current application will investigate the potential mechanisms underlying racial disparities in PEG tube placement after stroke by thoroughly addressing the various care processes involved in evaluation of swallowing recovery and decision-making regarding PEG placement. The specific aims are (1) to investigate whether access to SLP services including frequency of bedside swallow evaluations and VFSS testing differs among black and white stroke patients, (2) to determine the presence of an unconscious (implicit) racial bias and its effect on PEG decision-making among SLP providers, and (3) to assess whether patient-SLP provider communication behavior during bedside swallow evaluations differs between race-concordant (white patient, white SLP provider), and race-discordant (black patient, white SLP provider) patient-SLP provider pairs. This project is proposed as part of a career development plan for the PI, a cerebrovascular neurologist, to obtain training in methodology related to the study of implicit bias, patient-provider communication, and advanced statistical methods. The training program and the mentoring team the PI has assembled will help to elucidate important mechanisms underlying racial disparities in PEG placement after stroke, position him to apply the newly acquired skill set to investigate implicit bias and patient-provider communication behavior as the underlying mechanisms of other disparities in stroke care, and allow him to develop strategies aimed at mitigating disparities in stroke care via future interventional studies as he transitions to become an independent clinical investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Racial differences in the utilization of inpatient procedures, such as gastrostomy tubes, are common after stroke, and contribute to worse health outcomes among minorities compared to whites. The aim of this study is to understand the mechanisms underlying overutilization of gastrostomy tubes in black compared to white stroke patients, specifically to elucidate the role of differential access to Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) care, implications of implicit race bias among SLP providers, and patient-provider communication behavior.

"Partnering with an Urban Safety Net Hospital to Deliver Stroke Preparedness in the Emergency Department Abstract Acute stroke treatments are time-sensitive. Tissue plasminogen activator is administered 3 to 4.5 hours from the time of freedom from stroke symptoms. Imaging technologies such as computed tomography perfusion might extend the treatment window. However, rapid hospital arrival remains critical to eligibility for stroke treatment that can reduce subsequent disability. African Americans are more likely than Whites to delay in hospital arrival after stroke symptom onset. Prior interventions have educated African American groups or the entire community about stroke and the importance of calling 911. One-on-one stroke education interventions are few in number. This project aims to educate African Americans individually when they present to the emergency department (ED) of an urban safety net hospital. This approach allows us to access a hard-to reach population at high risk for stroke to deliver a one-on-one stroke intervention that addresses specific reasons African Americans delay in hospital arrival. By directly engaging with each participant, we expect to improve attitudes towards calling 911, which promotes early hospital arrival, and eligibility for stroke treatments which can ultimately reduce the burden of stroke on the population. Our specific aims are (i) to adapt a group- based stroke education intervention to be delivered in a one-on-one format to patients presenting to the ED, through qualitative interviews of patients and providers, (ii) to test whether the stroke intervention improves behavioral intent to call 911, as measured by response to stroke and non-stroke video vignettes. This research is in line with my career goal of developing, testing, and implementing behavioral interventions that will reduce racial disparities in stroke incidence and treatment. To this end, my plan is to (i) obtain skills in the practical application of community based participatory research, a research approach which involves partnering with the community to develop behavioral interventions, (ii) build skills in randomized clinical trial design, as rigorous efficacy testing of behavioral interventions involves randomization of participants, (iii) building expertise in implementation science methods, so that I can translate the interventions that I develop into clinical practice. The mentorship and resources at the University of Michigan will enable me to accomplish these career development goals. At the University of Michigan, I am among a group of accomplished health equity stroke researchers who have a track record of obtaining R-level NIH funding and are making significant contributions to reducing the burden of stroke on society. The university facilitates interdepartmental research collaborations, enabling me to be mentored by established researchers within and outside of the department of neurology. Courses are taught by experts in their field, providing a rich learning environment. Additional resources include organizations that offer seminars and workshops to facilitate the transition to an independent investigator. The proposed project and career development plan will expedite my research independence. Future R01 studies will involve scaling up and implementation of the proposed intervention. Project narrative Delay to hospital presentation after stroke symptom onset prevents African American patients from being eligible for stroke treatments that reduce disability. Previous educational interventions designed to educate African American patients about stroke and the importance of calling 911 have mostly been delivered community-wide or in a group format, settings that do not adequately address individual reasons for hospital delay. This project will determine whether delivering stroke education individually to African Americans at high risk for stroke improves recognition of stroke symptoms and intent to call 911 if stroke symptoms should occur.",Partnering with an Urban Safety Net Hospital to Deliver Stroke Preparedness in the Emergency Department,10038411,K01NS117555,"['Attitude ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior

"StrokeBelt StrokeNet The proposed StrokeBelt StrokeNet (SBSN) RCC will benefit from the established infrastructure, basic science and clinical stroke expertise, and stroke clinical trial experience at UAB, and work with established partner institutions in the Southeastern US, including Children’s of Alabama, the UAB/Lakeshore Research Collaborative, the University of Mississippi Medical Center, and the University of South Alabama. Each institution has its own network of referral hospitals, clinical trial infrastructure and experience enrolling in stroke clinical trials. The result is that a large part of the Stroke Belt will have access to StrokeNet Clinical Trials. The SBSN will succeed by leveraging key attributes of our region and network. First, the SBSN RCC will offer combined access to nearly 3,500 acute stroke patients annually, many of them minorities, in an underserved part of the US. As in our NeuroNext program, we will aggressively pursue the inclusion of underrepresented and minority populations in our clinical trials through collaboration with the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Center (MHRC) and Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment (STRIDE). Second, UAB and its partners have a track record of patient‐ oriented stroke research and successful stroke clinical trial recruitment. Over the last 3 years, UAB alone has participated in 20 NIH‐ or industry‐sponsored multicenter phase 1, 2 and 3 trials in stroke treatment, prevention, and recovery, enrolling 401 patients. We were nationally‐leading recruiters in the TUCSON, CUFFS, CLOTBUST‐HF, SAMMPRIS and CLEAR III trials. We actively enrolled in the first StrokeNet trial, DEFUSE3, are currently enrolling in CREST‐2, and preparing for participation in ARCADIA and CREST‐H. We are the leading recruiting center in MyRIAD and the second leading center for MISTIE III. Over the last 3 years, SBSN institutions/investigators have participated in a total of 37 trials in stroke treatment, prevention, and recovery, and enrolled a total of 2050 subjects. Third, we have extensive experience in stroke recovery with specific expertise in stroke‐related aphasia recovery/rehabilitation, TMS and imaging, motor recovery, tele‐rehabilitation and robotics. Fourth, our proposed network will be strengthened by the already‐strong connections between the UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) and our partner institutions. All of the institutions in our proposed network are already our partners, and already have experience with master IRB reliance agreements. Fifth, our research program will build upon our already‐successful recruitment by applying a performance improvement approach to enhance clinical trial screening, enrollment and retention. Strategies include specific screening, enrollment and retention methods; rigorous and continuous monitoring and performance improvement of trial implementation and subject screening, enrollment and retention; training and sharing of best practices; and programs to enhance engagement and enthusiasm of investigators and coordinators across the network. Sixth, the training of stroke clinical scientists at UAB will be enhanced through programs developed with the UAB CCTS and UAB School of Public Health (SOPH). The proposed StrokeBelt StrokeNet (SBSN) RCC has a robust network of institutions with access to a large population of potential subjects, many of them minorities, in an underserved part of the US, a track record of successful enrollment in stroke clinical trials, a rich community of basic science and translational stroke researchers, and an extraordinarily collaborative environment with the desire to contribute to the StrokeNet effort.",StrokeBelt StrokeNet,9999052,U24NS107223,"['Alabama ', ' Awareness ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Heart ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' Industry ', ' Methods ', ' Mississippi ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurology ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Patients ', ' Quality Control ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Robotics ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' human subject ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Neurologist ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' Recovery ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Medical center ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' Modeling ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke therapy ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Improve Access ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' minority health ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' tele-rehabilitation ', ' telerehab ', ' telerehabilitation ', ' operation ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' screening ', ' Business-Friendly Atmosphere ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative atmosphere ', ' interactive atmosphere ', ' interactive environment ', ' interdisciplinary atmosphere ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' peer-group atmosphere ', ' peer-group environment ', ' collaborative environment ', ' motor recovery ', ' recovery in aphasia ', ' aphasia recovery ', ' minority communities ', ' recruit ', ' Stroke Belt ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke clinical trials ', ' StrokeNet trials ', ' StrokeNet clinical trials ', ' Infrastructure ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U24,2020,298500,0.27037371954526007
"Reducing stroke risk in African-American men PROJECT SUMMARY  The burden of stroke among US adults is the fifth leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability, costing an estimated $19 billion. African-Americans (AA) have substantially higher stroke rates, compared to any other racial-ethnic group. Compared to whites, AA have greater stroke disability, more post- stroke complications, and slower recovery. Racial disparities in stroke outcomes are particularly high among AA men. Unfortunately, there is only a limited literature that has specifically focused on improving post-stroke care for AA men stroke survivors. Written In response to NIH PA-13-328: Health Promotion among Racial and Ethnic Minority Males (R01), the proposed project will test a curriculum-guided self-management support approach, TargEted MAnageMent (TEAM) focused specifically on AA men at high risk for stroke. TEAM is a group-format, nurse and patient co-led intervention focused on patient and family needs, practice in problem- solving, and attention to emotional and role management. The project builds upon promising pilot data from 2 previous R21 projects using TEAM. Novel project aspects include the: 1) Focus on AA men, 2) Use of Peer Dyads (stroke survivors and their care partners) as a key intervention component, 3) Use of curriculum-driven self-management, which has rarely been used in studies of AA men, and 4) Investigation of mechanistic factors that may help explain the most salient experimental elements of TEAM.  Work by this study team in the landmark Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) suggests that intensive efforts to reduce blood pressure (BP) to appropriate target ranges can reduce acute events like stroke, and that the proposed study site is an ideal recruitment environment with invested key personnel, and supportive infrastructure to conduct a rigorous evaluation of the TEAM approach in high-risk AA men. The proposed project is a 6-month prospective randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of TEAM vs. wait- list (WL) control in AA men who have experienced a stroke or TIA within the past 5 years. The primary outcome is change in systolic BP, while secondary outcomes include diastolic BP, cholesterol, triglycerides and glycemic control for individuals with diabetes. An exploratory analysis will evaluate posited mechanistic attitudinal targets (stroke knowledge, self-efficacy, perceived social support) as well as proximal behaviors to reduce stroke risk including diet, exercise, smoking, and tobacco/substance use.

"Stroke Central Atlantic Network for Research (SCANR) SCANR, the Stroke Central Atlantic Network for Research is based in the Mid-Atlantic region and headquartered in Washington, DC, and Charlottesville, VA. SCANR is located on the edge of the Stroke Belt, and both DC and Baltimore have high stroke incidence. SCANR includes four Carnegie Research 1 universities (Georgetown and George Washington Universities; the Universities of Virginia and Maryland), two CTSAs, a translational research institute (THRIV), a US News & World Report National Honor Roll Hospital (Children's National Medical Center), the largest hospital in DC (MedStar Washington Hospital Center), two Historically Black Universities (Howard University and University of DC) and the NINDS Intramural Stroke Program. SCANR sites evaluated over 4100 acute strokes in 2016, >50% were Black/African American. Our NINDS-funded trial recruitment is excellent, screening all eligible patients for and enrolling in StrokeNet trials: DEFUSE 3, MISTIE 3, HiDef, Rhapsody, SHINE, POINT, and MR WITNESS, along with additional NINDS-funded trials. SCANR also includes the National Coordinating Center for SHINE (UVa, Johnston-PI), and the CREST-2 registry and imaging core (UMB, Lal). SCANR 2.0 continues to have all of the excellent qualities that made SCANR 1.0 a strong contender for StrokeNet selection: pediatric stroke and stroke rehabilitation, patient populations and innovative recruitment practices for health disparities research, and the link to the NINDS Intramural Stroke Program. These strengths will stand out with the pediatric, rehab, and pediatric rehab trials in the StrokeNet pipeline. SCANR 2.0 includes UVa as a high-performing site for acute treatment and prevention trials. UVa also provides expertise in biomarkers, genetics, and prehospital research. The addition of UVa and UMB made SCANR a truly regional Coordinating Center. SCANR 2.0 research expertise includes multimodal imaging, microbiomics, multi-omics, Neurorehabilitation trials, brain stimulation, and robotics. We are well positioned to translate early phase NINDS intramural studies into the extramural setting. We have a track record of recruiting substantial numbers of specific cerebrovascular phenotypes (cervical artery dissection, cerebral venous thrombosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, etc.). Our consortium of academic rehab hospitals is outstanding. We currently have four trial proposals submitted to StrokeNet in varying stages of the process. Our existing Participant Recruitment and Retention Core (PRRO Core) has played a leadership role in the StrokeNet network. SCANR investigators serve on national StrokeNet steering committees and cores. Our StrokeNet fellows have diverse clinical backgrounds (2 vascular neurologists, 1 PT PhD, 1 OT) and subsequently, they successfully compete for external funding (TL-2, KL-2, AHA). They have opportunities for outstanding research training and mentorship across our Mid-Atlantic institutions, preparing them for productive research careers. SCANR investigators recently successfully established a novel national K12 program for rehabilitation research. We currently have 5 relevant fellowship programs and three adult neurology residencies at the SCANR 2.0 sites. This training joins strong multidisciplinary clinical and research expertise in stroke with much experience in research and career development of clinician scientists. The Stroke Central Atlantic Network for Research encompasses the Mid-Atlantic region. As a Regional Coordinating Center (RCC), it will continue recruiting people with stroke for trials ranging from prevention to acute intervention to rehabilitation. The unusual features of this RCC are its capture of nearly all stroke patients in DC and much of the Mid-Atlantic, its ability to recruit underserved individuals from both urban and rural settings, and its research strengths in multimodal MRI, genetics, Neurorehabilitation, and disparities.",Stroke Central Atlantic Network for Research (SCANR),10007912,U24NS107222,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Arteries ', ' Baltimore ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Dissection ', ' Hospitals ', ' Leadership ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maryland ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mid-Atlantic Region ', ' Middle Atlantic States ', ' Neurology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Registries ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Residencies ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Venous Thrombosis ', ' Phlebothrombosis ', ' Virginia ', ' Washington ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' neurological rehab ', ' neurorehab ', ' neurological rehabilitation ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Cervical ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' news ', ' Genetic ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' rehab research ', ' rehabilitation research ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Fellowship Program ', ' K12 Mechanism ', ' K12 Program ', ' Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Program ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' treatment trial ', ' pediatric stroke ', ' Childhood stroke ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' patient population ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' Prevention trial ', ' multiomics ', ' multiple omics ', ' urban setting ', ' rural locality ', ' rural place ', ' rural setting ', ' recruit ', ' participant retention ', ' Microbiomics ', ' microbiome science ', ' microbiome studies ', ' microbiome research ', ' Stroke Belt ', ' stroke patient ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke incidence ', ' StrokeNet trials ', ' stroke trials ', ' ']",NINDS,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U24,2020,312621,0.358538212414458
"Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly Stroke is a major public health problem in the United States. It is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of serious disability in adults. There are an estimated 800,000 strokes in the United States each year, with an estimated 7 million stroke survivors. Twenty percent of stroke survivors require institutional care after 3 months and 15%-30% are permanently disabled. Recurrent events, which occur in 185,000 stroke survivors in the United States each year, are associated with higher mortality rates, greater levels of disability, and increased costs as compared with first strokes. Stroke in adults is strongly age dependent, and the rate of adverse outcomes and complications associated with stroke increases with advanced age. Because the United States population is aging, the population at risk for stroke and recurrent events will increase over the coming decades. The high prevalence of stroke and its associated deficits impose a large burden on patients, their families, and the healthcare system. Optimizing post-acute care and secondary prevention efforts for stroke survivors represents an important target to reduce the burden of recurrent stroke, particularly among the elderly. Racial/ethnic and regional disparities have been identified for stroke incidence, prevalence, and mortality, but relatively little research has focused on potential disparities in the patterns of recurrent stroke events. The Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly study will use Medicare administrative data to achieve the following specific aims: 1) to assess temporal patterns in national recurrent stroke rates among elderly Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with ischemic stroke and describe disparities by sociodemographic and comorbid/clinical characteristics; and 2) to determine county-level rates of recurrent stroke, the persistence of geographic patterns over time, and county-level factors that may be contributing to disparities. Clinical practice, public policy, and reimbursement decisions are increasingly informed by data obtained from administrative datasets. The Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly study will be the largest contemporary investigation of recurrent stroke rates and patterns in the United States. Results from this project will identify geographic areas and subgroups that have distinctive health profiles that put them at high risk for recurrent stroke. Such information will inform care providers, insurers, public health agencies, and policy makers about communities that may derive the greatest benefit from targeted programs and community-based interventions. Results from the study will provide clinicians, investigators, and policymakers with national data on rates, trends, and patterns of recurrent stroke hospitalizations among the elderly, including variation among patient subgroups and geographic regions.",Disparities in Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly,9908037,R01AG056628,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ',

"DISCOVERY: Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY Stroke is the major cause of an adult disability epidemic in the US, with a major contribution from post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID), the rates of which are disproportionally high among the health disparity populations. Despite the PSCID’s overwhelming impact on public health, a knowledge gap exists with regard to the complex interaction between the acute stroke event and highly prevalent pre-existing brain pathology related to cerebrovascular (VCID) and Alzheimer’s disease, or related dementia (AD/ADRD). Understanding the factors that modulate PSCID risk in relation to index stroke event is critically important for developing personalized prognostication of PSCID, targeted interventions to prevent PSCID, and informing future clinical trial design. In response to this critical challenge, we propose Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY (DISCOVERY), a collaborative network of clinical sites with access to acute stroke populations and the expertise and capacity for systematic assessment of PSCID led by a team of recognized experts in VCID, AD, acute stroke, health disparities, and multi-center research. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine which specific subsets of stroke events cause (or do not cause) PSCID and which additional demographic (sex, race, ethnicity), clinical factors and comorbidities that synergize with acute stroke to result in or prevent PSCID. The overall scientific objective of this study is to elucidate mechanisms of brain resilience/susceptibility to PSCID in diverse US populations based on complex interplay between life-course exposure to multiple vascular risk factors, pre-existing burden of microvascular and neurodegenerative pathology, the effect of strategic acute stroke lesions, and the mediating effect of genomic/epigenomic variation. We will achieve this goal by implementing the DISCOVERY Network of 30 clinical sites, which under the leadership of the Administrative Core and guided by the research strategy delineated by the Recruitment and Retention, Statistics, and Repository Cores, will conduct a prospective, multi- center, observational, nested-cohort study of 8,000 nondemented ischemic and hemorrhagic incident stroke patients within 72 hours of symptom onset, who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, with serial cognitive evaluations and assessments of functional outcome, with subsets undergoing research MRI and PET and comprehensive genetic/genomic and fluid biomarker testing. In a series of systematic, hypothesis driven experiments we will: 1) identify the independent and combined effect of the acute stroke lesion, pre-existing burden of disease, and baseline markers of brain resilience on PSCID; 2) examine the role of acute stroke as a critical factor in accelerating AD/ADRD and VCID pathology leading to PSCID; and 3) develop two distinct generalizable personalized-medicine models for individual patient outcome prediction and patient selection for clinical trials. DISCOVERY will become a landmark study to unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early stroke recovery, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation. Stroke-related disability - including cognitive impairment and dementia - is a public health epidemic and a key national research priority in the United States. Because of its disproportionately high impact on health disparity populations, understanding the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive decline is a matter of equitable health care delivery. DISCOVERY, the proposed collaborative nationwide network of clinical sites with access to diverse acute stroke US populations has the expertise, experience and capacity to execute a large prospective study that will unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early recovery after stroke, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and
